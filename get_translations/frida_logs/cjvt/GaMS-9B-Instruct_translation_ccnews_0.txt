# Microsoft Lumia 640 and 640 XL officially revealed

Microsoft has unveiled the latest handset in its burgeoning Lumia range - the Microsoft Lumia 640. There's been plenty rumours about the handset so there wasn't too much surprise when Stephen Elop took to the stage at MWC 2015 to revealed the Microsoft Lumia 640.  The Microsoft Lumia 640 won't come with Windows 10 straight out of the box, but Elop noted that it will be fully upgradeable to the new mobile OS later in the year. Full specs include a 5-inch screen, 1.2Ghz quad core chip inside, 3G & LTE functionality, an 8MP camera, 2500mAh, gorilla glass, Windows 8.1 and it is also NFC enabled. There will also be single and dual sim variants of the device. The phones will be available later this year in: orange, blue, white and cyan Lumia 640 XL If five inches is just too small for your pocket, then you will be pleased to read that Microsoft has also released an XL version of the device. Unsurprisingly, the bigger handset has been called the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL and it comes packing a 1080p 5.7inch screen, 13mp camera and LTE. The device will also come with a one-year subscription to Office 365 and the Windows 8.1 OS will be upgradeable to Windows 10 when it is released. You get all this for 189 Euros. Microsoft said that, among others, Carphone Warehouse, T-Mobile, O2 and Orange will be stocking the device in Europe. AT&T in the US will stock the Lumia 640 and 640 XL. If this is all a little too middle of the range for you, then don't panic: Elop insisted that its flagship Lumia will be unveiled later this year. Check the rest of our MWC 2015 coverage<end_of_turn>

# Tower Square in Springfield gets an AT&T store; mall continues focus on amenities and services

SPRINGFIELD — Tower Square is getting a cell phone store as its new owners position the 48-year-old mall as the place downtown workers can find goods and services quickly and without driving. Taylor Made Communications of East Hartford is opening an AT&T preferred retail store, said Demetrios Panteleakis, president of the MacMillan Group, which represents the tower and its new owners. The store, which Panteleakis said will open within 30 days, will offer cell phone products and repairs, AT&T DISH Network services, home security products and an internet café. The 2,000-square-foot store will be on the first floor near a space where White Lion Brewing is building a production brewery and tasting room. The new AT&T space was most recently a small retail location for the UMass Center at Springfield, which remains on the second floor. Panteleakis said Tower Square is shifting focus away from traditional retail and toward providing amenities and services for the 1,700 to 2,000 people who work every day in the mall and office tower, and those who work in nearby office buildings. "Tower Square is the center of Springfield's central business district and our goal is to be a resource for folks working and visiting," Panteleakis said. "We want to make Downtown Springfield the place again." White Lion announced two weeks ago that it was moving into Tower Square, in a space on the Bridge Street side of the building. It had its new stainless-steel brewing tanks delivered a few days before Christmas, to much fanfare. The brewery will open in the spring. Panteleakis said the escalators that were once in the atrium near the AT&T store is going will not be replaced. They were redundant, he said, as there are other escalators and two elevator banks nearby. "They cut off an area that we want wide open, so we can host events," he said. Renovations are underway at the restaurant Currents in the Tower Square Hotel, which will reopen soon as a larger, full-service restaurant. Sections of the restaurant are open during the work, he said. Four partners — Dinesh Patel, Vid Mitta of Lexington and Rohit Patel and Kamlesh Patel of Maine — bought Tower Square in April from MassMutual. They paid $7 million for the 180,000-square-foot mall, 1,200-space parking garage, the 28-story office tower and the park across the street where Steiger’s Department store once stood. Those same partners had already bought the adjacent 265-room Tower Square Hotel from MassMutual for $10.5 million. MassMutual built the tower in 1970 for $52 million — $330 million when adjusted for inflation. It opened in 1971 as a way for downtown Springfield to compete for retail business with the new shopping malls. The complex was known as Baystate West until 1996. It is connected by pedestrian bridges to Monarch Place on one side, and the former federal building at 1550 Main St. and an adjacent parking building on the other. Over the years, the Tower Square Mall was home to stores like A.O. White, Belmont Records, U.S. Factory Outlet and a Friendly’s. It was connected by pedestrian bridges to two now-closed department stores: Forbes & Wallace and Steiger’s.<end_of_turn>

# Chloe Lewis Flaunts Tan Curves In Barely-There Bikini Throwback Picture

Fresh from her recent vacation in the Maldives with her boyfriend of two years, TOWIE star Chloe Lewis shared a stunning throwback snapshot with her one million followers.  The British reality star was showing some serious skin in the photo as she rocked a barely-there two-piece white string bikini.  Lewis posed for the camera in knee-high surf showing off a trim waist and long lean legs. She wore her sea-soaked hair pulled back behind her head and a simple set of gold hoops. The brunette bombshell twisted her body in such a manner that it put her curvy bosom and rear on full display.  Alongside her stunning snapshot Lewis also penned a very cryptic message as she ringed in the New Year.  “The older I get the more I realise the value of privacy. Keeping your circle small. You can be open, honest & real while still understanding that not everyone deserves a seat at the end of your table. This year I have learnt a lot. HAPPINESS is most important I wanted to thank my wonderful friends, family & my Danny for an amazing year.”  In just 24 hours since she published the photo, her following showered it with over 26,000 likes and just shy of 200 comments.  Chloe’s massive Instagram following seemed to have mixed opinions of the photo as some appreciated her beauty while other questions the hypocrisy of preaching about privacy and selectiveness in the caption of a photo with her donning a barely-there bikini.  “Value your privacy and share your bikini snaps with thousands!” One individual jested in the comment section of the photo.  A second chimed in: “Stunning but how can you preach privacy and sell it with a bikini shot? No hate I think you are beautiful but still.”  “Don’t know what’s better the photo or the caption,” a third added.  The 29-year-old beauty is currently dating her stockbroker boyfriend, Danny Flasher. While the duo have been an item since December of 2016, they didn’t make their relationship public until the following year.  It appears the starlet’s boyfriend has caught the eyes of TOWIE producers who have voiced an interest in adding Danny into the show.  Chloe, however, says that he turned down the role because he already has a great job that he enjoys, Daily Mail reports.  Chloe has also admitted that she isn’t too keen about being in another relationship that is in the public eye of a reality TV show following her previous relationship with TOWIE co-star Jack Hall being on camera.<end_of_turn>

# BJP, Congress face off over 'Vande Mataram', Shivraj Singh Chouhan to sing national song at MP Secretariat with 109 BJP MLAs on January 7

Bhopal: After 'Vande Mataram' was not sung at Madhya Pradesh secretariat, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday said that all 109 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs will recite the song at the Secretariat in Bhopal on January 7, 2019, Monday.  Taking to Twitter Chauhan mentioned that the national song will be sung before the Assembly session starts on January 7, in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan at 10 am.

However, the newly formed Congress government led by Chief Minister Kamal Nath chose to not sing the national song on the first day of January. This triggered a massive debate between the two parties.  Speaking on the incident, Kamal Nath said that the order "has been put on hold". He added that a decision has been taken to implement the order in a new form. He also asked if those who don't recite the Vande Mataram are not patriots.  "The order to recite Vande Mataram in the Secretariat on the first day of the month has been put on hold. A decision has been taken to implement the order in a new form. Those who do not recite Vande Mataram are not patriots?" said the CM.<end_of_turn>

# Are Aurora Cannabis Inc and Cronos Group Stock Worth Owning in 2019?

Cannabis stocks had a banner year in 2018. And thanks to a surfeit of landmark developments -- such as the legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada, Mexico's slow but steady march toward legalization, and Thailand's decision to suddenly decriminalize medical marijuana at the tail end of the year -- this emerging growth industry appears to be on solid footing heading into 2019. Still, investors may want to think twice before diving headfirst into this so-called "green rush." After all, the largest market in North America -- the United States -- remains off-limits for pioneers like Canada's Aurora Cannabis Inc. (TSX: ACB) (NYSE: ACB) and Cronos Group (TSX: CRON) (NASDAQ: CRON). And that situation won't change until marijuana is decriminalized at the federal level. Continue Reading Below Equally as problematic, these top Canadian producers have yet to even ramp up production levels to the point were they can adequately meet domestic demand, keeping them from being cash flow positive on a consistent basis. While these two key headwinds are likely to fade with the passing of time, they're certainly going to shape the industry's near-term outlook. With this theme in mind, let's consider if either of these top pot stocks belong in your portfolio in 2019. A contender for best in class Aurora, as a company, went through a major metamorphosis in 2018. Through a series of seminal acquisitions that included CanniMed Therapeutics, ICC Labs Inc., as well as MedReleaf, Aurora greatly expanded its international footprint, production capabilities, and product offerings. As a result, Aurora has become the largest cannabis player in Europe. It brought several top-selling recreational products to market in Canada last year and has established a solid product line in the all-important medical cannabis segment. Most importantly, though, Aurora is now on pace to achieve an industry-best production output of 700,000 kilograms per year within the next few years, thanks in no small part to management's ultra-aggressive business-development strategy. Advertisement The big deal is that Aurora should have the scale necessary to meet its ambitious international expansion. The company's enormous projected production capacity should also translate into a significant cost advantage over the broader field of cannabis producers. In fact, the company expects production costs to drop below 1 Canadian dollar once all of its facilities become fully functional. The drawback here is that Aurora's bid to become the top Canadian cannabis company has clearly come at shareholders' expense. In brief, Aurora's stock struggled last year, due to the company's ever-rising share count: What's the verdict? Aurora certainly has a bright future ahead of it. But this stock arguably doesn't belong in your portfolio until management finds a way to fund the company's growth-by-acquisition strategy without continually diluting current shareholders. A different kind of cannabis company With a pro forma production capacity of only 117,150 kilograms per year, Cronos Group certainly doesn't sport the same type of economy of scale as Aurora. But the company has other unique strengths that could make it a worthwhile investment. First up, Cronos inked an enormous partnering deal with American tobacco giant Altria late last year. This deal transformed Cronos into one of the healthiest cannabis companies in the game from a financial perspective. As a result, Cronos now can accelerate the build-out of its production facilities and pursue licensing deals of its own without having to tap the public markets. Additionally, Altria's vast infrastructure and regulatory expertise should give Cronos a distinct competitive advantage in the multibillion-dollar American cannabis market, if and when lawmakers end federal prohibition. That fact alone sets Cronos apart from the rather crowded field of Canadian cannabis stocks. Cronos' recent partnering deal with Ginkgo Bioworks to produce rare cannabinoids on a commercial scale also has the potential to differentiate this company from the pack. In short, this novel collaboration could result in the development of a host of secondary cannabis products over the next three to four years -- possibly opening up an untapped multibillion-dollar marketplace in the process. All that being said, Cronos' near-term valuation is anything but appealing from a classic value-investing paradigm. At 16.7 times its 2019 projected sales, after all, Cronos stock is currently among the most expensive in all of healthcare. What's the bottom line? Cronos shares probably are going to struggle this year because of its premium valuation and lack of near-term growth drivers. The primary headwind is that Cronos' value proposition centers around its long-term projects with Altria and Ginkgo -- neither of which is likely to bear fruit this year. As such, this pot stock probably doesn't belong in your portfolio this year, either. 10 stocks we like better than Aurora Cannabis Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

# Emotive road safety video featuring boy and his pony goes viral - Horse & Hound

The creator of a video showing a young child losing his pony in a road accident hopes to get across to drivers the need to slow down and pass horses with care.  The fictional video was created by Holly Woollock, who is in her final year of film production at the University of Salford.  NB: Please wait while the video loads below… if the video does not appear, click here to watch.  Holly, who owns retired thoroughbred Lulu and six-year-old mare China, told H&H: “I’ve owned horses for 15 years and for my production assignment at university I wanted to create something that I’m passionate about.  “I got China unbacked two years ago, broke her in myself and trained her to go out on the roads. I used to take her out in-hand and cars would pass so quickly and it completely scared her. It took about six months for her to allow me on her back on a hack without having to lead her or go out with another horse.”  The video shows nine-year-old Heath Ashley writing a letter to Father Christmas to say “all I want for Christmas is my best friend back”, following an accident involving a car and Heath’s Welsh section A mare Rosie on the roads. Heath can be seen approaching Rosie’s stable with a carrot on Christmas morning – only to find it empty.  “I wanted to create more emotion and do something a bit different to portray the message by using a child in the video. I thought while I’m in my final year and have access to all of this good filming equipment I should try and make a difference to drivers who don’t understand horses, and tell the story from a different perspective,” said Holly.  Holly said she has received positive feedback on the video, which has been seen more than 680,000 times.  “The message is for drivers to take a few moments out of their day to slow down and pass horses with care. They might think ‘it’s just a horse’ and don’t realise the emotional connection and bond we have with them as owners and riders,” she said.  “I want to communicate to drivers that slowing down can make a huge difference. That’s someone’s son or daughter or mum or dad riding that horse. Drivers are endangering themselves too; an accident can have such a big impact.”  Heath’s mother Sara Ashley, who rides out on the roads with her family three times a week and also appears in the video, told H&H Heath was happy to be involved with Rosie.  “Heath appreciates things can happen with horses and he knows the importance of road safety and wearing high-vis,” said Sara.  “A lot of drivers don’t appreciate how easily a horse can spook and just think the rider should have them under control and the horse will do as it’s told – they don’t realise a horse has a mind of its own and if something scares them, they will spook.”  Continued below…  The petition has attracted more than 10,000 signatures since it was created on 15 November  The rider is calling for others to wear hat cameras and report incidents  Subscribe to Horse & Hound magazine from just £20.99 – that’s a saving of 45%  The video was filmed in sections with the car involved in the “accident”, and the sound effects, added later.  “Heath was happy to help and he was very safe doing it. We reassured him there wouldn’t be a car on the road and nothing would happen to Rosie, the car was added in after,” said Sara.  “We thought a child on a pony might be a stronger message and make people think a bit more about children ride on the roads as well. It was quite a shock when we saw the final video with the car added and the sound, it’s been done so well – it’s really gets you.”  For all the latest news analysis, competition reports, interviews, features and much more, don’t miss Horse & Hound magazine, on sale every Thursday.<end_of_turn>

# Newlyweds Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth rang in the new year with a family ski trip — see the photos

Newlyweds Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth rang in the new year surrounded by their family on a ski trip. They were joined by couples Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky and Luke Hemsworth and Samantha Hemsworth. The festivities reportedly took place in Montana and it has been speculated that Cyrus and Liam were honeymooning. The couple, who tied the knot during a low-key ceremony that took place in Tennessee on December 23, shared plenty of photos ringing in the new year on the slopes. The newlyweds are reportedly in Montana as part of their honeymoon, but neither star has confirmed the speculation.

# Jerry Nadler Slams Trump Administration For Being ‘Apparently Willing’ To Let Migrant Children Die

In the wake of the deaths of two migrant children while in the custody of the U.S. government, many people have questioned Donald Trump and his administration in regards to their immigration policies. This news has only added to the criticism they have already faced in recent months following policies that have separated thousands of children from their parents after being brought into the country.  Recently, New York Representative and incoming House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler offered his opinion on the subject while appearing on CBS This Morning on Wednesday, January 2, where, the Hill reported, he placed blame for the deaths of two Guatemalan children purely on the White House and it’s policies.  Nadler explained during the show that the Trump administration’s “inhuman policies” were purposely made miserable in an attempt to “deter” people from coming to the border seeking political asylum.  He also added that the House Judiciary Committee would “certainly” be holding hearings in regards to the deaths of 8-year-old Felipe Gomez Alonzo and 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin, noting that they would “subpoena witnesses and documents if necessary” during the process.  “We’ve asked for all relevant documents as to why kids are dying in custody of Department of Homeland Security, why families are being detained,” Nadler said.  “This is inhuman, and it’s not precedented,” he continued. “It’s a deliberate creation of the Trump administration, which is trying to make things as miserable as possible. And if kids die, they’re apparently willing to have that.”   Incoming House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler placed blame for the recent deaths of two migrant children in government custody squarely on the White House and its policies https://t.co/wYNgZwfQUV  — POLITICO (@politico) January 2, 2019 South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said while appearing on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, December 30 that he also plans to hold hearings to look into the deaths of the two children. Graham is expected to be the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  While Nadler has placed the blame squarely on the Trump administration, the president has maintained that it is the Democrats who should “strictly” be at fault, tweeting on Saturday, December 29 that the party and their “pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally” is the true culprit.  President Trump continued his though, using the tragedies as further reasoning as to why there needs to be stricter security along the U.S.-Mexico border in the form of a wall.  “If we had a Wall, they wouldn’t even try!” he claimed.  The White House has not yet responded to requests for comments regarding Nadler’s comments on CBS This Morning.<end_of_turn>

# Gold hits its highest peak since June 2018

You are here  Gold hits its highest peak since June 2018 Bengaluru  GOLD scaled a more than six-month peak on Wednesday as the dollar fell along with Asian equities after disappointing data from China cemented fears of a slowdown in global economic growth.  Spot gold was up 0.28 per cent at US$1,285.71 an ounce, after hitting its highest since June 15, 2018 at US$1,287.31 earlier in the session. US gold futures rose 0.5 per cent to US$1,287.80 per ounce.  "It looks very optimistic and fundamentally supportive for gold as the overall mood is still very uncertain and the market confidence is still weak on global growth worries," said Benjamin Lu Jiaxuan, a commodities analyst at Phillip Futures. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was hovering near a two-month low hit in the previous session. A softer dollar makes the greenback denominated bullion cheaper for investors holding other currencies. "The global economy has entered into an uncharted territory considering the fact that the Chinese data was worse than expected," said Kunal Shah, head of research at Nirmal Bang Commodities in Mumbai, India.  "With uncertainties on global economy and geopolitical concerns, it's just a matter of time that gold is going to shoot up." REUTERS<end_of_turn>

# Column: The Senate’s ‘religious Test’

“The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” Some if too few readers might recognize the above is Article VI of the U.S. Constitution. Recent events have convinced me too few legislators recognize it as well. That whole “no religious Test” is a pretty tough nut to crack, apparently, if you’re a senator of the Democrat persuasion. How else does one characterize the behavior of Sens. Kamala Harris (CA) and Maizie Hirono (HI)? Both women are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and resorted to Mean Girl tactics to thwart Brian Buescher’s U.S. district judgeship nomination. Seems it’s unacceptable to hold a judgeship these days if you’re a member past or present of the Knights of Columbus. “OMG, Becky, look at his scapular!” The KC, understand, is a male-only Catholic social and philanthropic organization, and, therefore, according to Hirono, it holds fast to “a number of extreme positions.” You know the drill: Disapproval of same-sex marriage and abortion, for some, elicits responses ranging from suffering the vapors to “Get behind me, Satan” apoplexy. Of course, Satan, in this context, is any organization or person not aligned with progressive social groupthink. For most of us, however, Satan is a very real spiritual creature. Readers will note that I wrote “in this context” above -- we all know every side exercises a tendency to demonize their opponents. But, to my knowledge, no Republican senator has ever asked a judicial candidate to pledge that he or she would recuse him- or herself from any case because of a membership in Catholic Daughters or the Knights of Columbus. Yes, I know, it’s somehow unbelievable anyone in this day and age who identifies as Roman Catholic might actually, like, you know, adhere to the Church’s teachings on how best to pursue our respective eternal salvation. But that’s precisely the point -- under cover of opposing anything proposed by the current administration specifically or Republicans in general, our current political climate is precipitating Western society’s replacement of traditional Christian values with the Gospel of Social Justice -- whatever meaning the latter dialectically possesses on any given day; speaking “truth to power” it seems being little else but a craven power grab that deifies progressive-minded individuals as Delphic Oracles regardless the inconsistencies inherent in their worldview. This while marginalizing or attempting to totally discredit the rest of us who still worship our Sky God and continue to place stock in the tenets of Natural Law. Ridicule of or sneering condescension toward commonly held religious beliefs in the political arena is becoming more and more commonplace. For example, I’m not the first to report that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) expressed her concern that Catholic “dogma lives loudly within you, and that’s a concern” to Amy Coney Barrett during a 2017 judicial confirmation hearing. Feinstein’s colleague, Dick Durbin (D-IL), concurred. Is there such a thing as reverse exorcism wherein Christian teachings are expelled and replaced with the gospels according to Hirono, Harris, Feinstein and Durbin? The answer is no -- because rituals aren’t necessary to spread moral relativism, secular humanism, scientism and other Screwtape confusions of post-Enlightenment modernity. Instead of exorcisms, we have Senate inquisitions wherein “Catholic” and former Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) sided with Pope Francis on global warming while actively opposing the Church’s stands on abortion and same-sex marriage.

# China announces rover landing on moon's far side, a first for humankind - NY Daily News

The side of the moon that never faces Earth has been breached. China announced on Wednesday that its rover had touched down on the far side of the moon, a first for humanity.  While the U.S. and Russia have sent astronauts to the side of the moon that faces us, and numerous probes as well, no one has ever managed to land on the other side. As such this represents a significant achievement, experts said.  China Central Television (CCTV) briefly reported the news at the top of its noon broadcast, the Associated Press said, noting that the landing had happened at 10:26 a.m. There was some confusion at the outset, because shortly before that the state media outlets China Daily and China Global Television Network (CGTN) had pronounced the mission a success in tweets that were immediately deleted, CNN and The New York Times reported. The official word came down at 8 p.m. PT from CCTV, CNET said.  The rocket had taken off on Dec. 8 (Dec. 7 here) containing a lunar lander and a six-wheeled rover, according to CNET. It entered lunar orbit on Dec. 12.  The work done by Chang’e 4 – named after China’s mythological moon goddess, according to the Times – will lay the groundwork for numerous subsequent missions. The spacecraft’s rover will conduct low-frequency radio astronomical observations and probe the structure and mineral composition of the terrain, AP said.  The exploration could yield information on everything from the origins and evolution of Earth’s satellite, to the mineral and resource content of the crater in which it landed. The latter could pave the way for China to exploit these resources.<end_of_turn>

# Mark Hamill Admires The Joker’s Commitment To His New Year’s Resolutions

The actor has voiced Batman’s villainous rival in cartoons and video games over the years in addition to his gig as Luke Skywalker in “Star Wars.“ So, he knows when the force is with such a criminal mind. On Monday, New Year’s Eve, a Twitter user posted an old “Batman: The Animated Series” clip of Hamill’s Joker swearing not to kill anyone in the coming year but vowing to compensate by slaying a bunch before midnight. Hamill just had to weigh in. “You gotta admire his commitment,” the 67-year-old actor cracked. He then listed resolution tips gleaned from the Joker’s evil declaration. But with limits. “Execute your course of action that, hopefully, excludes executing anyone,” Hamill advised. h/t CNET<end_of_turn>

# Liverpool news: Vincent Kompany hits back at Jurgen Klopp by JOKING about Mo Salah tackle

Manchester City managed a pivotal win against the Reds last night at the Etihad to end their unbeaten streak in the Premier League. Pep Guardiola’s men emerged 2-1 winners at the Etihad thanks to goals from Sergio Aguero and Leroy Sane. It means City have cut the gap between them and Liverpool to four points at the top of the league. But many Kop fans were incensed that City captain Kompany stayed on the pitch after a hefty challenge on Mohamed Salah in the first half. The Belgian was making back-to-back starts for the first time since August, with Aymeric Laporte preferred at left-back. But a stray pass from John Stones had Salah looking to breakaway on goal, however, the 32-year-old flew into a tackle on the Egyptian forward. Referee Anthony Taylor booked the defender, and Klopp was furious after the match insisting he should have seen red. "I really like Vincent Kompany but how on Earth is that not a red card?" asked Liverpool boss Klopp afterwards. "He is last man and he goes in. If he hits Mo more he is out for the season." But Kompany has hit back at the German manager, claiming it was a great challenge. He told Sky Sports: “I thought it was a great challenge, was it not? “I got the ball, a little bit of the man but it wasn’t naughty. I didn’t try to injure him. “It was that or let him go through on goal.” Liverpool would have gone 10 points clear with a win but Kompany was more impressed with the manner of victory rather than the result itself. “I’m not worried about the result I’m buzzing with the tremendous performance,” he added. “We went toe to toe with a very aggressive team and we matched them. It’s still in Liverpool’s hands. “It came from our guts, a desire you can’t describe. We are a better team when we play with emotions.”<end_of_turn>

# ‘Friends from College’ Season 2 Trailer Reveals the Netflix Series’ Retooled New Season

Netflix has released the first Friends from College Season 2 trailer, offering a first look at the new season of the comedy/drama series. The show hails from Forgetting Sarah Marshall and The Five-Year Engagement filmmaker Nicholas Stoller, who directs and co-showruns the series with his wife Francesca Delbanco, based on their own personal experiences. The conceit basically follows a close-knit group of Harvard alumni as they navigate their messy lives in New York City, complete with complicated romantic entanglements and age-old drama.  The show’s first season received harsh criticism for basically making its characters too unpleasant, and in an interesting move, Stoller and Delbanco aimed to address and rectify those concerns with Season 2. Speaking with Indiewire, Delbanco notes that most people’s issues had to do with an affair at the center of the series:   “It was very clear from the critical response that people were really unhappy and uncomfortable about the affair between Sam (Annie Parisse) and Ethan (Keegan-Michael Key),” Delbanco said. “And the fact that the show didn’t take them to task or punish them for it. We felt like we really heard it. And we put an end to that affair. It was an idea we were interested in playing around with, grownups behaving badly and making a mess in their lives. But we heard critics feeling like it was too much and it was too unpleasant to be implicated in it by just watching and enjoying it.” Stoller says they’ve since ended that specific storyline, and Season 2 picks up a year after the events of Season 1:   “We were planning on adjusting it anyway because doing more affair stories would have just been repetitive, but that is not a part of the second season,” Stoller said. “Which I think will be a relief for a lot of people.” While I’m a big fan of Stoller’s work, I didn’t check out Season 1 specifically because of the criticisms of the unlikable characters, so I’m considering jumping into Season 2 cold. This trailer is certainly an intriguing mix of comedy and drama, and the cast is stacked. What say you, folks? Are you in?  Check out the Friends from College Season 2 trailer below. The series returns on January 11th with the eight-episode second season and also stars Cobie Smulders, Nat Faxon, Fred Savage, Jae Suh Park, Billy Eichner, and Sarah Chalke.<end_of_turn>

# Declan Donnelly hangs out with another ‘legend’ TV star ahead of BGT reunion with Ant McPartlin

Declan Donnelly has had an eventful start to the New Year after his beloved pet dog Rocky suffered a back injury. The Britain's Got Talent star called upon another popular TV personality for help following the incident - The Supervet star Dr. Noel Fitzpatrick - and fans were in awe at seeing the pair together.  Taking to Instagram to share a photo of himself with Dr. Noel, while cradling his pet Dachshund in his arms, Dec wrote: "Another thank you to this legend and the amazing staff at @fitzpatrick_referrals for taking care of Rocky after the silly sausage hurt his back again! We never fail to be impressed by the kindness and care shown by all. You’re heroes!"    Declan Donnelly took his dog to see The Supervet  The post sparked much discussion among Ant and Dec’s fans, along with their Britain’s Got Talent colleague David Walliams, who had his own theory about how Rocky sustained his injuries. "Well stop trying to ride around on him then," the comedian urged Dec, to which he replied: "How else am I supposed to get to the vets brain box?"  Dec’s visit to the Supervet comes as he prepares for an on screen reunion with Ant McPartlin, who is returning to Britain’s Got Talent after more than six months out of the public eye. The pair are starting to film auditions together this month, while the show will return to ITV in the spring. Dec memorably presented the live shows of the last series alone, while Ant did appear during the pre-recorded audition segments.    David Walliams joked that Dec had tried to "ride around" on his pet dog  The new dad recently impressed viewers as he hosted I’m a Celebrity alongside Holly Willoughby, with the series attracting a record number of viewers. However, Holly has since insisted that she won’t be back in 2019, and she will instead be handing the reins back to Ant. "It was a one-off, once in a lifetime adventure. Next year, I’ll be at home with everyone else having a glass of wine watching it," she said.  Like this story?

# Overspend hits £4.7m as pupils needing help nearly double

Money used to provide support for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in Gloucestershire is set to be overspent by £4.7million, according to a council document.  It was expected to be £3.2million by April this year but a council report reveals that it's risen by £1.5million.  Gloucestershire County Council is given the money for SEN and mainstream schools from central government but it is schools which spend it.  Placements at independent schools and top-ups for SEN and mainstream pupils are the reasons for the overspend, despite an overall increase in funding from central government.  More pupils who need help  Councillor Richard Boyles said that there are more than 3,500 pupils who need more help than is available through SEN support - nearly double the amount there were in 2015.  The council is "heavily dependent" on the Government's Spending Review settlement from 2020/21 and finding strategic solutions locally to fix the issue, a council document to be presented to the Schools Forum next week said.  Gloucestershire is set to receive £1.35million in April - and the same amount again next year - for additional high needs funding, but that will bring the overspend down to £2.7million.  The council will ask the Schools Forum, a committee of the county's education heads, if members would consider a separate seminar to discuss the issue of high needs funding in more detail.  Mr Boyles, cabinet member for children and young people, added that the council will continue to lobby the Government for fairer funding for all schools in the county.  'Schools face challenges'  Mr Boyles (C, Blakeney and Bream) said: "The additional funding from central government - which the county council and local MPs worked hard to secure - is great news for Gloucestershire schools and has helped to protect the mainstream school budgets.  "However, despite this overall increase in funding our schools still face many challenges with more children than ever needing intensive help and support at school and more than 3,500 in receipt of Education Health and Care Plans – nearly double the amount there were in 2015. We will continue to work with the Schools Forum to make a decision on how to bridge this funding gap.  "At its next meeting on January 10 the forum will be asked to consider a separate seminar on high needs to discuss the issue in more detail. We will also continue to lobby for fairer funding for all children in schools across the county.”  The news of the overspend comes as proposals to cut the money from mainstream schools' funding to pay for SEN pupils were scrapped last month.  Extra funding announced  The council decided against the move after the Government announced it will receive £1.35million this year for high needs pupils and the same next year, something which heads branded as a "small win".  In November the Schools Forum asked Education Secretary Damian Hinds to decide whether to plug £1.7m of it with money from central government allocated for the main schools budget.  Want to read more about politics in Gloucestershire?  We have a dedicated Facebook group for all our stories on political and democratic local issues.  You can join the debate and ask questions here.  The authority withdrew the request last December in response to the extra funding announcement.  In the same November meeting, the Schools Forum "reluctantly" agreed to plans that will mean fewer SEN pupils will receive extra money in schools across the county.  It's because there are more children that require special educational needs funding and the council have to redistribute "underfunded" money from central government.  The Schools Forum will discuss the issue on January 10, from 2pm.<end_of_turn>

# Connacht Names Team To Face Munster - Galway Bay FM

Connacht Names Team To Face Munster  Written by Sport GBFM on 4 January 2019  Prop Denis Buckley is set to make his 150th appearance for his province as the Roscommon man is named in Connacht’s starting side to face Munster in the Sportsground on Saturday (Kick off 7:35pm). Tickets for the InterPro derby have completely sold out as Andy Friend’s side go into the fixture with six wins in their last seven games.  Buckley is named in a front row that includes hooker Dave Heffernan who takes over the captaincy from Jarrad Butler who picked up a knock in the win over Ulster. In the second row the partnership of Quinn Roux and Gavin Thornbury continues with Ultan Dillane named among the replacements.  In the back-row Paul Boyle is named at blindside with Colby Fainga’a at openside and Eoghan Masterson coming into the starting side at number 8.  Jack Carty and Caolin Blade continue their half back partnership, with Blade named in the match day squad for the 16th game in a row.  In the midfield Tom Daly, who joined Connacht on loan in December, is set to make his Connacht debut alongside Tom Farrell.  While in the back three, Connacht’s record try scorer Matt Healy returns from injury to take his place on the wing with Cian Kelleher on the opposite wing and Darragh Leader at full back.  Ahead of the game, Connacht Head Coach Andy Friend says his side faces another huge challenge against Munster; “This block of three Interpros is a tough series of fixtures and has a huge bearing on the overall context of the season. We were disappointed to lose narrowly to Leinster in Dublin but we showed great character to bounce back and beat a really tough Ulster side last weekend. This clash with Munster is a big game and we will have to put in a huge performance to get a result on Saturday. As always though we will focus on our game. That’s where our focus has been all week and that’s where it has been all season.”  Commenting on his team selection, Friend added; “Dave Heffernan takes over the captaincy from Jarrad this week as he is carrying a knock. It’s also a huge occasion for Denis Buckley and his family as he will play his 150th game in a Connacht jersey. We are looking forward to another huge occasion in the Sportsground and we can see the people of the province have voted with their feet again with the game completely sold out since early in the week. They have been huge for us this season both home and away and we will be looking to feed off them again on Saturday evening.”  #CONvMUN  Kick-off 7:35pm:  (15-9) Darragh Leader, Cian Kelleher, Tom Farrell, Tom Daly, Matt Healy, Jack Carty, Caolin Blade, (1-8) Denis Buckley, Dave Heffernan (Capt), Dominic Robertson Mc-Coy, Gavin Thornbury, Quinn Roux, Paul Boyle, Colby Fainga’a, Eoghan Masterson.  Replacements (16-23): Tom McCartney, Peter McCabe, Finlay Bealham, Ultan Dillane, Cillian Gallagher, Angus Lloyd, David Horwitz, Colm Dé Buitléar.<end_of_turn>

# Newtownabbey woman phoned police to assist with a broken tooth, court told

A woman allegedly assaulted a PSNI officer after phoning to seek help for a broken tooth, a court heard on Friday.  Ruth Cunningham was given a 12-month conditional discharge and warned not to make any more “foolish and unnecessary calls”. Belfast Magistrates Court heard the 50-year-old, of Laurel Hill in Newtownabbey, Co Antrim, contacted police on October 28 last year. A prosecution lawyer said Cunningham requested assistance about a broken tooth. She was told it wasn’t a police matter, but responded by indicating that she may harm herself. Police then went to Cunningham’s home, locating her at the top of the stairs in a drunk and uncooperative state, the court heard. When she appeared to be making another call, a policewoman advised her to stop and moved towards her. According to the prosecution, Cunningham responded by slapping the constable’s hand and struggled during arrest. Defence counsel Luke Curran said his client has mental health issues and wanted to go to hospital. He argued that she was not making any malicious, drunken calls. District Judge Paul Copeland was also told Cunningham was the victim of a serious stabbing in the past. “She has had her share of woes and more,” Mr Curran added. Deciding to hand down the conditional discharge, the judge said he was giving her a chance at the start of a new year. But he warned Cunningham: “If there’s any further foolish and unnecessary calls that disrupt the police and their resources and you end up in court over it, this call will be revisited.”<end_of_turn>

# Suspected shoplifter Tasered as he tried to escape through roof of Sainsbury's

A suspected shoplifter was Tasered by police after he tried to escape through the roof of a Wolverhampton supermarket.  Police were called to Sainsbury's in Victoria Square at around 11am on Friday, January 4 to reports of a shoplifter.  The 29-year-old had been detained by the store's security but managed to give them the slip and fled to the warehouse at the back of the store.  When police arrived, he was hanging from the piping in a desperate bid to escape through the roof.  He then threatened to assault officers before jumping down from the ceiling.  Officers sprung into action and Tasered the suspect, who was then arrested.  A West Midlands Police spokesman said: "We were called to reports of a shoplifter.  "Security had detained him but he managed to escape out the back to the warehouse.  "Officers Tasered him in order to detain him and he is now in custody."<end_of_turn>

# A for Armani, B for Balenciaga; that’s what Karan Johar wants to teach his kids

A for Armani, B for Balenciaga; that’s what Karan Johar wants to teach his kids  Director Karan Johar has his own version of the alphabet, in which only high-end fashion labels feature. He said in an episode of Neha Dhupia’s show that this is the ABCD he’ll teach his kids. bollywood Updated: Jan 05, 2019 19:12 IST Filmmaker Karan Johar in an appearance on Neha Dhupia’s chat show recited his own fashion-inspired version of the alphabet, and left Neha in splits. “Karan Johar has cracked it - the only baggage worth carrying is one that’s full of hard-to-spell designer clothes,” Neha captioned the video on Instagram. In it, she asks Karan if he can tell her the ‘A-Z of fashion’ and off Karan goes. “A for Armani, B for Balenciaga, C for Christian Dior, D for Dolce & Gabbana, E for Escada, F for Fendi, G for Gucci, H for Hermes, I for Issey Miyake, J for Jaguar, K for Kenzo, L for Lanvin, M for Moschino, N for Nautica, O for Oscar de la Renta, P for Pucci,” he rattled off. But he halted at “Q” because “we shouldn’t ask questions about fashion.” And on he went, “R for Ralph Lauren or Ralph Russo, S for Stella McCartney, T for Timberland, U for Ungaro, V for Vivienne Westwood, W for Wendell Rodricks (because let’s go Indian), X we have many, Y for Yohji Yamamoto, Z for Zegna.” A shocked Neha applauded Karan’s effort and asked, “How do you even come up with that stuff?” And Karan replied, “That’s what I’m going to teach my kids. That’s the ABCD they’re going to know.” Karan is considered a fashion icon in the film industry, often sporting unique outfits at public events. He is the father to twins Yash and Roohi, named after his parents, Yash and Hiroo Johar. The children were born through surrogacy, and are often stars of Karan’s Instagram videos. The director also shares videos of his kids playing with other star kids of Bollywood, such as Taimur Ali Khan. In a recent video of the twins shared by Karan on Instagram, he can be heard asking Yash what he’s wearing. When Yash doesn’t reply, Karan says, “You’re not like your papa, you don’t care what you’re wearing, toodles.” After a successful end to 2018 with Simmba, Karan will move on to his other productions, Kalank and Brahmastra. He will also begin prepping for his directorial venture, the period drama Takht, featuring an all-star cast of Ranveer Singh, Vicky Kaushal, Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Janhvi Kapoor and Anil Kapoor. The film will be set in the Mughal era and will be a family drama about emperor Shah Jahan and his two sons, Aurangzeb and Dara Shikoh.

# Manitowoc: Edmund Fitzgerald shipwreck topic of historical society speaker event | Briefs

The Edmund Fitzgerald, which disappeared into a stormy Lake Superior on Nov. 10, 1975, is the largest shipwreck to ever go down on the Great Lakes. Wind gusts on that day peaked at nearly 100 mph and waves reached the height of a three-story building. During Hungry for History, Pennington will delve into the history and mystery of the vessel and will explore the opposing views of dive detectives who are still trying to determine what led to the demise of the 29-man crew. The massive ore freighter, built and owned by Milwaukee’s Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., was named after its president, Edmund Fitzgerald, who helped establish the Wisconsin Marine Historical Society. Hungry for History will discuss everything from the ship’s launch to its final radio broadcasts, and from the “Fitz’s” discovery on Superior’s bottom to the location of the vessel’s artifacts in various museums. A meal follows the program, which will be held at Holiday Inn-Manitowoc, 4601 Calumet Ave. Doors open at 5 p.m. with presentation starting at 5:30 p.m. and meal to follow.

# Lawless Custom Wood Bikes Start Kids Riding Right

Sorry, you'll have to go to South Africa to get one  We don't have to tell you that the weather outside is frightful, and we're all spending more time in the garage on projects than out on the road. Johann de Wet down in South Africa, during some downtime, decided to create a custom strider balance bike for his daughter to matched his BMW. After making a few Bimmers he took a hard look at a modern Triumph Bonneville and adapted that look to his strider design. With that Lawless Bikes was born.  This being the 21st-century, Johann didn't just sketch his ideas out on some plywood and build one bike. Using computers and CNC technology, Johann set himself up to be able to produce multiples of his design, edit it, scale it, whatever. The wheels and tires are the same basic units you'd find on any little kid's bike, but the rest of the bike is cut from thick sheets of birch plywood and bolted together. Add some custom paint, leather upholstery, and "Lawless" badges and away the little ones roll.  So far, there are only a few dozen Lawless balance bikes out there, since Johann has a good full time job and this is a side project, but they are all over the internet. Also, except for one that was sent to Europe, there is no system or plan set up to export them, and no way to order them from the United States (you can message then and beg via their Facebook page). From a July Facebook post on the Lawless page, they are investigating export options, but so far only take orders from South Africa.  Only because of that, if you want one I'd suggest you take a good long look at their design and draw up your own plans. If you've got kids, or just want a neat looking bike for display, get yourself a good thick piece of plywood and a bandsaw and start working. You'll need a pair of wheels, but tiny kid bikes are often next to free on Craigslist, at your local thrift shop, and at garage sales. The only thing I would add to the basic Lawless design would be a pair of struts to the swingarm simulating rear shocks and supporting the back end. If you do build one, or have already built something similar, drop a picture of it in the comments.<end_of_turn>

# Liquor store attacker had just been released from prison

WATERLOO – A Waterloo man had been on parole for less than a day when he attacked a woman at a liquor store drive-thru early Thursday. Waterloo police arrested Dayln Harrington, 25, on charges of assault with intent to commit sexual abuse, first-degree burglary and public intoxication. His bond on the new charges was set at $110,000, and he is on a no-bond hold for a parole violation. Authorities said he entered the passenger side of the woman’s vehicle as she pulled up to the Broadway Liquor service window shortly before 1 a.m. on Thursday. He allegedly groped the woman and pulled her hair until she drove around to the front of the store and fled. Police said she suffered several scratched in the assault. WATERLOO – A Waterloo man has been arrested after he allegedly attacked a woman in her vehic…  According to court records, Harrington has spent the last four years bouncing from jail to prison to parole for a 2015 hate crime vandalism --- police say he and another person spray-painted anti-Bosnian messages on a car --- as well as a 2013 domestic assault and burglary. Thursday’s pre-dawn groping attack happened less than 12 hours after Harrington formally started his latest parole stint after being released from prison, according to court records. Records also show that parole officials were suspicious of the Courtland Street address where he said he would be living after prison. Harrington told officials he would be living with his mother, but in December when corrections workers were reviewing the placement they discovered his mother didn’t live there. They did find a woman who initially claimed to be a cousin, but further investigation determined the woman wasn’t a cousin and was on probation herself. WATERLOO | Two Waterloo men have been arrested under the state’s hate crime statutes after t…  Harrington pleaded to second-degree criminal mischief in the 2015 hate crime vandalism case and was sentenced to up to five years in prison concurrent with prison time from second-degree burglary and domestic assault charges in 2013, which he was on probation for at the time of the vandalism. He was also ordered to pay restitution, and a charge of public intoxication was dismissed in August of 2015. Harrington was placed on work release in January 2017. In April 2018, he was arrested for operating while intoxicated following a traffic stop. He pleaded in May 2018 to the OWI and was sentenced to a year in jail, and his parole in the above-mentioned vandalism and burglary/domestic assault cases was revoked. The parole violation sent him to back to prison until he was released on parole on Jan. 2, 2019, according to corrections documents.<end_of_turn>

# Track cyclist Carl Grove – aged 90 – fails doping test at US Masters Track National Championships

Positive doping tests for amateur cyclists are not unheard of. Indeed they have become all too common in recent years. But it is rare for the guilty party to be a 90-year-old.  Cycling fans were raising a quizzical eyebrow after Carl Grove, a Masters champion from Bristol, Indiana, was handed a public warning by the United States Anti-Doping Agency after testing positive for epitrenbolone on July 11 last year.  Grove, the oldest participant at the Masters Track National Championships, had set a world record in the men’s 90-94 sprint category.  He claimed that ingesting contaminated meat the evening before competing was “more likely than not” the reason for his positive, pointing out that he had provided a clean sample the day before. Usada dismissed his argument, stripping him of his record.  While investigating the source of his positive test, Usada also determined that a supplement Grove was using prior to July 11, 2018, was contaminated with clomiphene, another prohibited substance.  The sheer absurdity of a 90-year-old testing positive will amuse some. But it is sure to alarm others, providing further evidence of a potentially serious problem within the amateur levels of the sport where testing is far less stringent.  In December 2015, 18-year-old national junior champion Gabriel Evans confessed to taking the blood booster EPO, saying he had been “curious” after watching the BBC Panorama doping documentary Catch Me If You Can, arguing that the culture had been “normalised” because he had read so many reports of professionals doping.  On the same day, UK Anti-Doping announced a four year-ban for a British Masters champion (age 35-39), Andrew Hastings, who tested positive for metenolone and stanozolol. In 2016 Robin Townsend, a 46-year-old club rider, tested positive for the stimulant modafinil and was also handed a four-year ban.<end_of_turn>

# Opinion: We want to drive customers to new Delanco MVC digs

It’s looking at this point like it may be South Jersey’s best-kept secret, and we surely don’t want it to stay that way. The New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission’s newest agency at 400 Creek Road in Delanco — which, at 12,000 square feet under roof, also happens to be tied for our largest — is crying out for customers to come in and put it to good use. When, during a recent visit, I looked over the expansive interior with all those open service windows and our super-friendly staff waiting to assist someone (anyone!) with a transaction, I wished I could personally steer customers inside. I pictured myself heading across the freshly paved parking lot — with its many available spaces — to Creek Road out front and, just like a ballpark beer vendor, I’d start hollering at passersby: “Driver licenses here!’’ “Take your road test here!” “Get your registrations and veteran designations here!’’ Ultimately, I thought better of standing on the side of the road, hawking our many services to customers to fill our vacant windows and testing sites. It’s not that we haven’t tried luring customers from our former Mount Holly location. We left signs to follow us, less than 10 miles down the road, to this shiny, new custom-built complex tailored to MVC customers’ needs. When we left that tiny rented office on Route 541 — nearly two-thirds smaller and located in an often-crowded shopping center — we put the word out to the local press, our own social media, and state and local officials, to come along with us to our new digs. We also held a big ribbon-cutting ceremony on Oct. 23, a day after we opened to the public. Joining me for our return to Delanco (we operated a driver testing center at the site until the mid-1990s) were New Jersey Sen. Troy Singleton, D-7th of Delran; Burlington County Freeholder Tom Pullion; and Delanco Mayor Kate Fitzpatrick, along with top Motor Vehicle Commission staff. But so far, the numbers remain down significantly. For November and December, traffic was down just over 30 percent each month over the same period in Mount Holly a year ago, resulting in about 10,000 fewer customer transactions. To be sure, many of you have already come to this beautiful new facility. But others, it seems, are making their way to agencies that are farther afield than Delanco — in Cherry Hill, Runnemede or Bakers Basin. For the Bakers Basin agency, on Route 1 in Lawrenceville, that 30-mile drive north is three times the distance from Mount Holly compared with Delanco. Don’t get me wrong. We welcome all of our customers to Bakers Basin and elsewhere, no matter where they live. But we’d also like to save you some time. And of course, we’d welcome the chance to show off our new facility. So feel free to help us spread the word. You heard it here first. Pssst, it’s no secret that the MVC is waiting in Delanco with open arms — and plenty of open service windows, too! Sue Fulton is the chief administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission.<end_of_turn>

# Henderson-based Xtreme Cubes sees growing industry

Cannabis farms, military shelters and downtown Las Vegas’ Container Park all have one thing in common: They were built from interlocking blocks created by Xtreme Cubes.  The Henderson-based company builds modular street structures it describes as “giant, prefabricated Legos.” The blocks come in a range of sizes and can be interlocked and used for things like offices, residential buildings, retail buildings and remote work sites.  According to CEO and co-founder Brandon Main, the modular building industry has been growing rapidly, with a growing number of diverse sectors taking an interest.  This Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.  What’s it like working in Henderson?  We started the company in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2008, but we quickly outgrew that factory. We landed on a property out here in Henderson in 2015. Moving out here, we have the space, we have the access to interstate, we have rail access, and Nevada is actually a very business-friendly state. There’s no income tax and a lot of opportunity with a tremendous workforce in the surrounding areas.  It’s a tough economy right now with low unemployment, but we can pull employees from neighboring states. Geographically, we’re in a good spot. Moving to Henderson allowed us to achieve our growth plans.  How has the modular building industry changed over the years?  The industry is growing rapidly. There’s a workforce shortage with such low unemployment. Contractors are struggling to find people to perform their work, and there’s a need for a high-quality product quicker.  The modular building industry has been around a long time. Even though there were other options, we took a cutting-edge approach to the process, and we said we’re going to design a steel building frame system that can carry all the load. Ours is a standalone application that is specifically aligned to customer needs.  What sort of industries use Xtreme Cubes?  Industrial was our starting sector, but over the years we got into commercial and retail and then residential. We built some cabin-style or condo apartment-style buildings. We’re getting into some hotels and then military or government-type buildings.  Some of the new sectors include military applications and hospitals. We’re going to be building some modular rehabilitation clinics and hospitals, or hospice care. We’re getting ready to release our first set of hotels, a multi-story apartment.  With the legalization of marijuana, medical cannabis is another new sector. As indoor farming grows, which is what these would be used in, they’re environmentally sealed containers. A lot of the problems with the cannabis industry is related to control of crops. No mold, pesticides, insects, anything that’s a potential infection to crops. We have a clean room where the operators can grow. If can be leafy greens, tomatoes, specialized herbs.  We as a manufacturer offer turnkey solutions to our customers. We design and build to exact requirements.  What’s the benefit of building with blocks as opposed to traditional construction methods?  Speed to market. With traditional construction methods, you’re burdened with the permitting process and delays with on-site inspections. We have the same building codes as traditional construction methods but in a factory environment. We have our own third-party inspector that comes to our factory. We marry them up together in sync and save all that time. We end up with a finished product in one-third of the time. We can run around the clock.

# How Denis Suarez will fit in at Arsenal

Arsenal boss Unai Emery is desperate to add Denis Suarez to his squad this month, and given the midfielder's quality it is easy to see why.  Emery had the 25-year-old on loan at Sevilla for the 2014/15 season, during which the club rather characteristically won the Europa League.  And given that Suarez has only made two La Liga appearances this season, Emery now wants to add the midfielder to his Arsenal squad, even though he is aware that he faces a tough battle to prise him away from Catalonia.  A fee of £20million has been mentioned for the services of Suarez, who has previous experience of English football with Manchester City , making two cup appearances in his two years with the club as a young player.  If he signed for the Gunners he'd expect to play a lot more of course, but where would he fit in?  We've taken a look at some possible formations for Emery which include the once-capped Spanish international.  The creative force in midfield (4-2-3-1)  Let's be honest, the big losers in any Suarez signing would probably be Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey, one of whom is definitely off at the end of the season and another might well be.  That would create a need for some midfield invention in the Gunners' team, and Suarez could provide that safe in the knowledge that he'd have Granit Xhaka and Lucas Torreira behind him.  Joining the attack (5-3-2)  Emery seems pretty wedded to a wing-backs system whenever he feels one is appropriate, and if he did that then Suarez could be more of a central force in linking up with Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.  Sead Kolasinac and Hector Bellerin would be looked to for the width.  On the wing (4-4-2)  It was interesting to hear Emery address transfers after the Blackpool game, and say: "Also a winger, right or left, one player can help us in this position."  Then when he was asked to describe Suarez, he said: "He was playing as a left or right winger for Sevilla when he was with me."  Hmm... right-winger in a 4-4-2 then?  That would allow Alex Iwobi to look to continue his recent impressive form from the left, as the central midfield pair stay together.<end_of_turn>

# Over 84m registered voters to participate in 2019 poll — INEC

“Registered voters should endeavour to collect their cards personally without which no person can vote on election day.” Romanus Ugwu, Abuja  The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has revealed that a total number of 84 million registered voters will participate in the 2019 general elections.  Delivering his keynote address during the official display of voters register in Abuja yesterday, INEC chairman Mahmood Yakubu accused politicians of buying up Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) from voters, adding that they are also financially inducing them to collect the Voter Identification Numbers (VIN) on their PVCs.  “In fulfillment of this legal requirement, the Commission has made available to each political party a copy of the entire national register of voters. After the mandatory display of the register in all polling units nationwide for claims and objections from November 6-12, 2018, the final register for the 2019 General Elections stands at 84,004,084 voters. This is the register that will be presented to each political party at today’s meeting. It is also the same register that will be available at each polling unit nationwide on election day,” the Commission chairman said.  The electoral umpire also ruled out the use of Incidence Form for the 2019 poll, warning that the deadline for the nomination of party agents for Presidential and National Assembly elections is February 1, 2019 while that of the Governorship, State Assembly and FCT Area Council elections is February 16, 2019.  “I am delighted to once again welcome the Chairman and other officials of political parties to our regular consultative meeting. With 39 days to the 2019 General Elections, electioneering campaigns are in full swing, following your nomination of candidates for the 1,558 constituencies for which elections will be conducted this year. As you are aware, the Presidential election as well as elections for 109 Senatorial Districts and 360 Federal Constituencies will be held on Saturday 16th February 2019.  “Two weeks later, Governorship elections in 29 States of the Federation, 991 State Assembly constituencies and 68 Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will be held on Saturday March 2, 2019. I want to seize this opportunity to thank the Chairmen and leaders of all political parties for the cordial working relationship with the Commission. Through the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), we have continuously synergised with parties, including our collaborative relationship on voter education ahead of major off-season elections.  “As you would have noticed, the Commission has been diligently implementing the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2019 General Elections. We have so far implemented 8 out of 14 activities. At this meeting, we shall implement the 9th activity by publishing the final register of voters for the 2019 General Elections as required by law.  “Similarly, the Commission has printed and delivered the Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVCs) to the States for collection by registered voters. I urge all registered voters who have not collected their PVCs to approach any of our Local Government Area offices and other designated collection centres nationwide to pick up their cards.  “While we are encouraged by the response so far, millions of cards are still yet to be collected. I wish to reiterate that the Commission will not allow the collection of PVCs by proxy. Registered voters should endeavour to collect their cards personally without which no person can vote on election day.  “On this note, let me re-emphasise the Commission’s policy that the Smart Card Readers will be used for the 2019 General Elections for accreditation of voters. For clarity, I wish to stress that the function of the Smart Card Reader during accreditation is to confirm, verify and authenticate the voter. First, it shall be used to confirm that the PVC is genuine and issued by INEC.  “Cloned cards or cards that do not match the codes for a particular polling unit in which the voter is registered will be rejected by the Card Readers. Secondly, the Card Readers shall verify that the voter who presents the PVC is the actual owner of the Card by ensuring that the personal details on the Card Reader are consistent with the manual register for the polling unit.  “Thirdly, the Card Reader shall be used to authenticate the fingerprint of the voter as an additional confirmatory procedure. If the fingerprint is not authenticated by the Card Reader but the PVC is confirmed as genuine and the voter’s personal details are consistent with the manual register, he/she shall be allowed to vote.  “However, where the biometric authentication fails, the voter will be required to thumbprint a box next to his/her picture on the register and to enter his/her mobile telephone number before proceeding to vote. The Commission has modified the Register of Voters for the 2019 General Elections accordingly.  Consequently, the separate Incident Form used in previous elections which is only completed by the Presiding Officer without the involvement of the voter is now abolished.  “Similarly, the claim that the Card Reader has been enhanced to recapture voters’ fingerprints at polling units and automatically overwrite the biometric record on our database is untrue and should be disregarded.  “As the election date is fast approaching, the Commission wishes to advise the leaders of political parties to start compiling the lists of your party agents for submission not later than 14 days to the election. In line with the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2019 General Elections, the deadline for Presidential and National Assembly elections is February 1, 2019 while Governorship, State Assembly and FCT Area Council elections is February 16, 2019.  “Very soon, the Commission will schedule a Train-the-Trainer Workshop for party agents. I urge you to nominate competent persons as master trainers capable of cascading the training to other party agents. 
“As campaigns are going on nationwide, the Commission will keep very close watch on campaign finance. In particular, we shall closely monitor spending by parties and candidates as well as individual and group donations to campaign organisations. We will discharge this regulatory responsibility diligently. “The Commission has designed Campaign Finance Reporting Forms to ensure compliance with the reporting requirements by parties. The EC16C for annual finance reporting by parties, the EC16D for income (including contributions and donations) and EC16E on party expenditure are already available on the Commission’s website.  “As elections approach, the Commission has to quickly finalise on the Guidelines and Regulations for the 2019 General Elections. In keeping with the Commission’s tradition to consult stakeholders, soft copies of the draft Guidelines and Regulations have been forwarded to all political parties through your official email accounts over a week ago.  “By making the document available ahead of this meeting, we hope that political parties would have studied it for discussion. We have also made one hard copy available to each party for this meeting. It is important to have your input at this meeting so that we can expeditiously finalise the document as well as the training manual for the General Election.  “Let me also seize this opportunity to reassure political parties that there is no change in the number of polling units and voting points used for the 2015 General Elections and the 2016 Area Council elections in the FCT as you will see from the register of voters to be presented to each party shortly. Any information to the contrary is utterly baseless and should be disregarded.  “I cannot conclude my remarks without once addressing the worrisome issue of vote buying. The Commission has responded to the menace in three ways. First, we altered the configuration of our polling units by moving the ballot boxes closer to the voting cubicles in order to make it difficult for voters to expose their marked ballot papers.  “Secondly, we have introduced a partial ban on the use of mobile phone and other photographic devices by voters while in the voting cubicles. Thirdly, we are introducing the rolling and flattening of ballot papers by voters before casting them into the ballot boxes.  “However, a new method of vote buying is being devised. We have received credible information that some partisan actors are now going round buying up PVCs from voters or financially inducing them to collect the Voter Identification Numbers (VIN) on their PVCs. In some instances, telephone numbers and details of bank accounts of voters have been collected.  “By collecting the PVCs, their intention may be to deprive the voters of voting since no one can vote without the PVC. By collecting their phone numbers and bank details, the intention is to induce voters by electronic transfer of funds to their accounts since it will be difficult to buy votes at polling units. By collecting the VINs, they may be acting on the mistaken notion that our system can be hacked into and the Card Readers somehow preloaded ahead of election and compromised.  “We want to reassure Nigerians that we are aware of the new tricks. It is a futile effort. We will work with the security agencies to deal with the violators of our electoral laws, including those who may be trying to compromise our staff responsible for making the PVCs available for collection by legitimate voters,” he said.<end_of_turn>

# Carter Hart getting start for Flyers as Blues interim coach Craig Berube returns to face former team

Craig Berube, who spent seven years with the Flyers as a player and two as their head coach, will return to the Wells Fargo Center as the St. Louis Blues' interim coach on Monday night.  “I look forward to it,” he told St. Louis reporters. “I was there a long time. It’s a good spot.”  Berube spent 11 coaching seasons in the Flyers' organization, including the NHL and AHL level.  Since taking over for the fired Mike Yeo in late November, Berube has a 9-10-1 record. The Blues were 7-9-3 under Yeo.  Berube will give goalie Jordan Binnington, 25, his first NHL start, and he will oppose 20-year-old rookie Carter Hart (2.80 goals-against average, .901 save percentage). It will be Hart’s second consecutive start.  During his career, Binnington has appeared in three NHL games in relief, compiling a 3.70 GAA and and .828 save percentage.  The Flyers and Blues are tied for the second-fewest points (36) in the NHL.  The Flyers will try to snap a six-game losing streak.  “I thought there was more good than bad in the last two games,” said interim coach Scott Gordon, whose team has a 3-5-2 record since he replaced Dave Hakstol. “...There have been some things that have been positive, but at the end of the day, everybody wants wins — players, coaches, we’re all the same in that regard.”  Joel Quenneville, who led Chicago to three Stanley Cup titles but was fired earlier this season, has been mentioned as a permanent head coach for either the Blues, Flyers, or another team.  The Blues' Vladimir Tarasenko, who has 11 goals and a minus-16 rating, has just two goals in his last 14 games. In his career, he has scored a goal against every NHL team except the Flyers.<end_of_turn>

# 'Little Hats, Big Hearts': Knitting for a Cause community knits hats for the American Heart Association

The Knitting for a Cause community project at the main branch of the Laman Library in North Little Rock usually knits hats for the homeless. But, it's switching gears to knit hats for the American Heart Association and Children's Heart Foundation. It's part of the "Little Hats, Big Hearts" program, which celebrates American Heart Month, and raises awareness for congenital heart defect prevention.  "We make the little red hats to give to babies that have been born with heart defects and it's sort of a movement to raise awareness, for that," Shelby Reed said. The group is collecting red yarn to make the hats and is also asking for volunteers' help. They said even if you don't know how to knit, making these hats is easy enough that anyone can do it.<end_of_turn>

# Sterling Heights woman pleads guilty to abandoning man

A Sterling Heights woman pleaded guilty Monday afternoon to abandoning a man she was hired to take care of at a Mt. Pleasant McDonald’s in a disoriented state with injuries on his head, torso and elbow. Noha Hamze, a 57-year-old DHHS-paid caregiver, pleaded guilty to 4th Degree Vulnerable Adult Abuse for leaving Roger Garza, a 78-year-old man requiring constant attention, and going back to Sterling Heights with no plans to return for the man. At the time on Sept. 17, Garza was described as, “confused, unkempt and injured.” Mt. Pleasant police were called to the Pickard Street McDonald’s at around 6:30 a.m. Sept. 17, where they found Garza unattended. A bandage was wrapped around a head injury covered in dried blood, and his torso was sunburned. He was also sitting in his own filth. He was later found to have a cut on his elbow. Police later figured out that he lived in metro Detroit, was not mobile on his own and was abandoned by his live-in caregiver. Although police identified Hamze as Garza’s caregiver, she originally proved elusive to question. She finally returned police phone calls, telling them that she didn’t want to be contacted about Garza anymore because she was going to Washington D.C. to do important work. She also said that Garza was difficult to care for and that with him in the hands of police and the state that he was in a better place. One thing that changed by Monday was what she did after leaving Garza at the McDonald’s. Hamze originally told police that she’d gone back to a hotel they’d stayed in to retrieve money to pay for food. She said when she returned that Garza was gone. Hamze answered, “Yes” when Chief Judge Eric Janes laid out the scenario that she’d returned to Sterling Heights with no plans to retrieve Garza, however. “You abandoned him,” Janes said. “Yes, your honor,” Hamze said. The case was scheduled to go to court Tuesday morning in Janes’ courtroom. Instead, he set sentencing for Jan. 22 at 1:45 p.m. Originally, he’d scheduled it for 11:30 a.m. that day, but moved it because of the time it would take Hamze to travel. Abuse of a Vulnerable Adult, 4th Degree is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.<end_of_turn>

# Family thrown out of Butlin's after their children fall ill

A family say they were kicked out of a Butlin's resort on Christmas Eve because two of their five children fell ill.  Mum Jess Underwood says instead of enjoying what should have been a nice family Christmas night, she was instead made to feel like a criminal and ESCORTED off the premises by security guards.  Jess and her partner, Stephen Griffiths, as well as their five children were staying at the Minehead resort over the festive period.  It was the first time Jess, Stephen and her children, Summer, 10, Brooke, nine, Alyssa, six, Zailah, three, and Konnor, four, had ever gone to Butlin's.  But their break was unexpectedly cut short when Butlin's staff asked them to leave three days before the end of their trip, claiming that it was their policy to evict people if they fall ill.  "When two of my children were sick in the night after we arrived I asked for clean sheets and some blankets because it was cold. They said someone would get back to me but no-one did," Ms Underwood, from Penzance said.  "I asked for some help again in the morning but again no-one called us back or gave us the clean sheets we needed. Two of my children and I had to sleep on the sofa because we could not change the sheets.  "They left us hanging all day the next day until 4.30pm before they told us we had to leave immediately. They still charged us for a whole day before kicking us out even though they've known since the night before that the children had been sick.  "No-one even asked after the children to see how they were. We were told we had one hour to get out then they had security guards escort us as if we had done something wrong. It was appalling. Butlin's behaviour was utterly disgusting.  "We had taken a small Christmas tree and all the presents up there with us because we were supposed to spend Christmas at Butlin's. We had to put everything back in the car in a rush and drive home to Penzance in the middle of the night and put everything back together at home in time for Christmas.  "We had to find somewhere to eat at the last minute because we had no food in the house as we were supposed to eat at Butlin's and still paid the whole week for the catery.  "The children were so upset. They still remember it and talk about how we were kicked out of Butlin's. What happened is outrageous."  Butlin's has been asked for a comment. A spokesman said that because of the festive period holidays it might take some time before they are able to reply, reports CornwallLive.  However, buried deep in the policy section of the resort's website, Butlin's confirmed it is their right to evict anyone who falls sick on their premises.  The policy reads: "Should Butlin's become aware, or have reasonable grounds for suspicion, that a guest has contracted a contagious disease or illness that has the potential to infect a large number of people quickly; they and their party will be required to leave the resort."<end_of_turn>

# IRS workers to rally over shutdown on Thursday

FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) --  Talk in Washington that tax returns would be processed haven't reached the Fresno processing center, where returns and refunds for a dozen western states are handled. "No, not as far as we are concerned. They (the center) are shutdown, the only thing they've been doing in our submission processing site is opening mail and processing checks people have been sending in for their payments. Other than that there's nothing going on," said Jason Sisk with National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU). RELATED: 2018 income tax refunds will go out on time despite government shutdown Sisk represents the more than 5,200 union workers in various IRS offices in Fresno. They have received confusing news. Some have been called in to work, then told to go home. And they're all missing a paycheck. Most employees make between $15 to $20 an hour, missing a paycheck could be a major setback. "They are in distress because payments are coming due their rent their house payment," Sisk said. Professional Tax preparers are also in the dark as to the progress of the shutdown, but are urging folks to file their returns "Come in, file like you normally would, the quicker you file you can protect your identify so nobody else files before you. You are kind of like getting in line, you know when you are going to the grocery store and standing in line. You complete your return, and as soon as the IRS opens, your return will go right through," said Jennifer Hernandez of H&R Block. Sisk says the usual rush of hiring temporary IRS workers has stopped because employees that do the hiring have been furloughed. He says he doesn't see how anything will get done on time. IRS workers are planning rallies across the country on Thursday, in Washington D.C. as well as in Fresno at the IRS processing center on Lane Street. Sisk says despite the President's claim to have the support of furloughed and unpaid workers, he doesn't see it, "That's not true at all. They are the ones not getting paid whether they are able to work or not able to work."<end_of_turn>

# Rajasthan loan scam: Congress says fraud took place under BJP regime

After the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party had alleged that there were irregularities in the disbursal of loans to farmers, the Congress has said that the scam took place when the BJP was in power in the state. BJP was in power in Rajasthan from 2013 to 2018 when it lost to Congress. Speaking to the media in the capital Jaipur, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that it's possible that more such scams are likely to come to light. "Such a big scam happened during the BJP regime. This one has come to the fore. It's possible more such scams will be unearthed," Gehlot said. The BJP had demanded that the scam should be investigated and that action should be taken against the culprits. "The farm loan scam should be investigated and action should be taken against culprits," Madan Lal Saini, BJP state president, told India Today TV. The Gehlot government had decided to waive off loans given to farmers through cooperative banks - one of Congress's poll promises. However, massive irregularities have been unearthed in the disbursement of these loans. Three officers were suspended in the matter. However, many farmers in Dungarpur district who did not take loans found their names in the list of beneficiaries whose loans have been waived off. The alleged fraud that has surfaced in several villages of Dungarpur district including Govadi, Nandor and Jethana had come to light In Dungarpur's Sagwada area, loans were picked up in the name of several farmers who never actually received the amount. In Govadi, Rs 8 crore was given to around 1,780 farmers as loan. Villagers have demanded an investigation into the loan disbursement. "We demand justice. A scam of Rs 8 crore has happened. We have given a memorandum to the sub-divisional magistrate demanding action against guilty officials," Ishwarlal Charpota, a former sarpanch, said. "We have received complaints from a few places in Sagwada. Investigations are on. Three supervisors have been suspended," Chetan Ram Deora, Dungarpur district magistrate said.<end_of_turn>

# Big questions left unanswered in long-term strategy for NHS

Today at last the long-term strategy for the NHS in England will be published.  So long-term, it will take the health service right through the next decade, which is no mean feat.  NHS England’s Chief Executive, Simon Stevens, has written the plan at the request of the prime minister. He says it can save up to half a million lives by focusing on killer conditions and getting people to live healthier lifestyles.  An extra £20 billion promised to the NHS over the next five years will be used to help achieve this. But how?  Well, we’re told diagnosis of major diseases will be made easier and quicker with technology, mental health provision will increase and patients will be looked after better in the community - keeping them out of hospital, ensuring they live longer and healthier lifestyles.  This all sounds plausible when you take into account that GPs, local community and mental health will get a third of the extra funding.  So, less money you might say, going straight to hospitals.  The buzzword today is integration. Few really know what that means, but in essence it’s about the NHS working better with local authorities who control social care in the community.  It might seem crazy that this isn’t joined up already, but it’s not, and while local authority funding has decreased, care in the community has had to be scaled back, putting huge pressure on hospitals.  That will change we’re told. It’ll all be joined up, hospitals will be able to discharge elderly patients more freely and community care will take over.  That’s all well and good but there remain some big unanswered questions. We’ve been waiting two years for a Social Care green paper, which will consult on the best way to fund and manage social care in England.  Without any plan to tackle the financial crisis in that system, it’s hard to see how the vision in this 10 year NHS plan can be achieved.  That, along with dwindling local authority budgets, seems right now a fantasy. The health secretary Matt Hancock has promised the Social Care green paper will be published in the coming weeks so all eyes will be on whether it can deliver what the NHS needs.  It is also admirable to encourage healthier lifestyles and to offer healthy living programmes to those most at need, but that pledge is at odds with the massive cuts to public health budgets.  Local authorities, in charge of those finances, have had to cut back on key services which ultimately help those with drink problems, drug problems and weight problems. How will the government achieve this pledge if councils aren’t given extra money to keep vital service?  My last point is who will deliver this? The staffing crisis in the NHS is not a joke. Around 100,000 doctors and nurses are needed and unions have warned that this figure will just keep rising. If there are no medics to deliver this, the plan is pretty much pointless.  The government has promised to tackle staffing in the service at a later date, but until that happens there will always be a fear this plan can’t be delivered in full.  There is a lot of good in this plan. Of course there is. But until these questions are answered there will, I think, always be doubters.<end_of_turn>

# Newcastle captain Mitchell Pearce supports club's harsh stance on off-field misbehaviour

Newcastle Knights captain Mitchell Pearce has backed his club's decision to impose heavy financial penalties for off-field misdemeanours.  As part of a no-tolerance attitude towards poor conduct, Knights players will be fined 25 per cent of their salary if they cause trouble away from the paddock, with suspensions and contract terminations to also be considered. Prop Jacob Saifiti became the first man to feel the wrath of the new policy on Monday, fined $50,000 (of which half is suspended) for his involvement in a December bar fight in which he broke his leg. Saifiti was cleared of wrongdoing by police and the club released a statement at the time saying the 22-year-old "attempted to defuse a situation involving other innocent bystanders." Regardless, Gardner told the Newcastle Herald that "the penalty warrants the behaviour we are trying to put a stop to."  He added: "Every case will be treated on its merits and obviously, all the facts need to be looked at in any incident but the fine of 25 per cent on the contract will be across the board for everyone." Pearce, who was fined a record $125,000 by the NRL in 2016 for the infamous Australia Day scandal, believes the severe punishment is justified given the expectations placed on modern players. "It's just the way the game's going, mate, isn't it," Pearce said on Tuesday. "There's a lot of pressure at the moment on players and high-profile people, but it comes with the territory and there's a lot of perks in rugby league now. "So there's obviously a lot of stuff and a reputation we've got to live up to, and I know Phil and Browny [coach Nathan Brown] are making some harsh decisions. "We know as a playing group we've got to keep developing into a really professional outfit. "We've still got improvement in that way, and as a side it's definitely a goal of ours to keep evolving on and off the field." NEWCASTLE SEASON PREVIEW: All you need to know about the Knights in 2019 Pearce is expected to be announced as the sole skipper of the Knights in the coming weeks. The former NSW Origin halfback captained the Sydney Roosters in 2015 and shared the job with Jamie Buhrer at Newcastle last season. The 29-year-old is adamant he can handle the added responsibility. "I definitely want it. I definitely enjoy it and I loved the co-captaincy last year," Peace said. "I was captain of the Roosters there for a bit. But I was younger then and I feel at this point of my life, with what we're really building here at the moment, I'm enjoying that leadership role. "We'll see what direction Brownie goes with the leadership stuff. We'll have meetings over the next few weeks so it all keeps evolving."<end_of_turn>

# Prince George and Princess Charlotte to MISS mum Kate Middleton’s birthday

The brother and sister apparently resumed the school term after spending Christmas with the Royal Family over December and January. George is said to have returned to St Thomas’s in Battersea today, while Charlotte went back to Willcocks Nursery School in Kensington. But the unfortunate timing means they will join dad Prince William in missing the Duchess of Cornwall’s birthday tomorrow. Daily Star Online reported earlier how Wills will miss a part of his wife’s birthday as he returns to work with a royal engagement. Only now it looks like George and Charlotte will be spending a large chunk of the day at school as their mum turns 37. The return to day-to-day life for the Cambridges come after they joined the Queen for the festive period at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk.   Kate and William were seen joining Her Maj to church over the weekend before finally heading back home to Kensington Palace. With Wills, George and Charlotte busy on Wednesday, it appears Kate will be celebrating most of her birthday with newborn son Prince Louis. Louis, aged eight months, is not set to start nursery for more than another year, with Charlotte and George starting when they were two. Meanwhile Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to introduce another addition to the royal family in spring. The couple are expecting their first baby in March or April, meaning Kate and Wills’ children will have a new cousin to play with.<end_of_turn>

# Court Overturns Police Shooting Protester's Conviction

Court Overturns Police Shooting Protester’s Conviction MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A Minnesota appeals court has overturned the conviction of the only person who was tried for blocking a freeway during a protest of the police shooting of Philando Castile. Jeffrey Berger argued that his conviction for misdemeanor public nuisance was unconstitutional. The three-judge appeals court agreed with his contention that the state failed to provide sufficient evidence that he ``interfered with, obstructed or rendered danger for passage'' on Interstate 94 in St. Paul in July 2016. The 77-year-old Minneapolis man was one of 44 people prosecuted by the City of St. Paul for protesting the police shooting of Castile by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights. Berger was the only one to go to trial. Forty-three others pleaded guilty.<end_of_turn>

# US orders refuges to staff for hunters despite shutdown

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is directing dozens of wildlife refuges to return to work to make sure hunters and others have access despite the government shutdown, according to an email obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.  The partial restaffing of 38 wildlife refuges is angering wildlife groups, who accuse the Trump administration of trying to minimize the public impact of the more than two-week-old shutdown to limit the political blowback for President Donald Trump. Trump and Democrats in Congress are locked in a dispute over Trump's demand for billions of dollars for a wall on the southern U.S. border.  In an email sent Tuesday afternoon, Margaret Everson, principal deputy director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, cites "opportunities, including hunting" that are being lost in the shutdown.  Everson advises in the email that 38 wildlife refuges around the country will bring back some furloughed staff using carryover funds.  Digital Access For Only $0.99  For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.  #ReadLocal  "While many of our refuges have remained accessible, but not staffed, the extended lapse in federal appropriations is impacting both our ability to serve the public and to protect natural resources under our care in some places," Everson wrote.  "For the next 30 days, using previously appropriated funds, we will bring back a limited number of employees to resume work on high priority projects and activities that support the Service's mission and meet the public's desire for access to Refuge lands," Everson said in the email.  Everson did not immediately respond to an email from the AP seeking comment.  The shutdown has forced federal agencies to stop paychecks for hundreds of thousands of government employees, limiting government services to only the most pressing, such as Transportation Security Administration workers providing security at airports without pay.  Unlike as in some past shutdowns, the Interior Department — which oversees both wildlife refuges and national parks — initially had directed national parks to stay open but with little staffing, leading to pile-ups of uncollected garbage and human waste in parks. The National Park Service over the weekend said some parks could start using visitor fees to staff during the shutdown.  On Wednesday, the National Wildlife Refuge Association, the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Retirees Association urged the Trump administration to keep national parks, wildlife refuges and other public lands closed to the public during the shutdown.  "It is simply impossible to steward these shared American treasures properly, leaving thousands of lands and waters accessible to the public with no staff on site, even for an emergency," the groups wrote in a letter.  Desiree Sorenson-Groves of the National Wildlife Refuge Association criticized the partial restaffing of some wildlife refuges.  "If it wasn't essential to have these refuges open for the past three weeks, how is it essential now?" she asked. The bottom line was the Trump administration was trying to "make this less painful to the American public," she said.  According to the email, the wildlife refuges being restaffed include Oklahoma's Wichita Mountains, scene of an annual winter elk hunt. The other national refuges staffing up again stretch from the Midway Atoll in Hawaii to Florida's Merritt Island.<end_of_turn>

# AGC 'acted according to law' on Lee Suet Fern's case

AGC 'acted according to law' on Lee Suet Fern's case The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) said yesterday it acted according to the law in referring a case of possible professional misconduct by Mrs Lee Suet Fern to the Law Society.  Its statement was in response to media queries on a Facebook post Mrs Lee's husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang, made on Monday evening when he questioned the AGC's move.  The AGC also said its actions are consistent with how it has handled other cases of alleged professional misconduct by lawyers.  Last year, it referred five cases to the Law Society, the AGC told The Straits Times.  In the case involving Mrs Lee, the AGC said on Monday that she appears to have prepared the last will of her father-in-law, founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, and arranged for him to execute it in 2013.  It added that this placed her in a position of conflict and was a breach of the rules governing the conduct of lawyers because her husband was a beneficiary in the will.  In a Facebook post the same evening, Mr Lee Hsien Yang said his wife was never the late Mr Lee's lawyer and questioned the timing of the AGC's decision and the public interest being served.  "What public interest is being served by AGC here? Why waste public resources on a private matter, and after all this time?" he said.  "Why is AGC rushing this case in 2019 when the facts were known by all parties for years?"  Together with his sister Lee Wei Ling, Mr Lee Hsien Yang is feuding with his older brother, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, over the fate of their father's house at 38 Oxley Road.  In Monday's Facebook post, Mr Lee Hsien Yang also said the AGC's assertion that his wife had refused to respond to it was untrue, and called on the AGC to release its full correspondence with his wife.  DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL  The AGC, in its response yesterday, said there will be a full hearing before the disciplinary tribunal appointed by the Chief Justice, and Mrs Lee can present her case there.  It added that it does not propose to comment further on the merits of the matter and reminded "all parties to be mindful not to prejudice the proper hearing of the matter".  On the five cases referred to the Law Society last year, the AGC said all of them involved direct referrals to the disciplinary tribunal.  It also said it had made referrals to the society for a wide range of misconduct by lawyers. These include acting in conflict of interest, wasting the court's time and misleading the court, scandalous cross-examination and witness coaching.<end_of_turn>

# Club Notes for Jan. 13

Gadsden Music Club The Gadsden Music Club recently met at the Music Center at Temple Beth Israel to celebrate Alabama Day. President Sharron Yancy welcomed members, guests and new members Linda Dixon and Judith Drew. Chaplain Evelyn Cleveland gave the invocation. Col. John Larkins led the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. Evelyn Cleveland led the singing of the “Star Spangled Banner,” the Federation Hymn, ”The Collect,” and the Hymn of the Month, “Let There Be Peace on Earth.” Ronald Higgins accompanied on the piano. Program chairman Sharon Dasinger introduced Dr. Norman Dasinger, pianist, who performed his arrangements of popular standards, Christmas and sacred music. He is a retired Jacksonville State University professor of education, businessman and a member of the “Kings of Swing.” Born in South Alabama, his father insisted and encouraged his sons to take piano lessons. One day, the boys announced that they were quitting their lessons, but the next day a grand piano was delivered. There was no more talk of quitting and Dr. Dasinger still treasures that piano, which is in his home today. President Yancy gave a brief history of Alabama Day and of the state song “Alabama.” The poem was written by Julia Tutwiler and set to music by Edna Gockel-Gussen. “Alabama” was adopted as the state song by an act of the Alabama Legislature on March 1, 1931. The Episcopal Day School Choir, directed by Sharon Reynolds, provided Christmas music during lunch. The Gadsden Music Club is a member of the Alabama and National Federation of Music Clubs. The Gadsden Music Club was organized in 1915 and has been serving Gadsden for more than a century.<end_of_turn>

# Riverfront Playhouse looking for actors for upcoming Spring performance Of Mice and Men ~ East Valley Times

Audition Announcement  When:  Sunday Jan 20th at 6pm  Monday Jan 21st at 6pm  Where:  Riverfront Playhouse  1620 E. Cypress Ave  Needed:  8 men ages 20-60  1 African American man, preferably 50-60  1 woman age late teens to early 20s  Play Run:  March 23rd to April 20th  Of Mice and Men synopsis: 
 Two drifters, George and his friend Lennie, with delusions of living off the “fat of the land,” have just arrived at a ranch to work for enough money to buy their own place. Lennie is a man-child, a little boy in the body of a dangerously powerful man. It’s Lennie’s obsessions with things soft and cuddly, that have made George cautious about with whom the gentle giant, with his brute strength, associates. His promise to allow Lennie to “tend to the rabbits” on their future land keeps Lennie calm, amidst distractions, as the overgrown child needs constant reassurance. But when a ranch boss’ promiscuous wife is found dead in the barn with a broken neck, it’s obvious that Lennie, albeit accidentally, killed her. George, now worried about his own safety, knows exactly where Lennie has gone to hide, and he meets him there. Realizing they can’t run away anymore, George is faced with a moral question: how should he deal with Lennie before the ranchers find him and take matters into their own hands. 

 Monologues are not required, however, if you are new to our theater and would like to prepare one, you are welcome to.

# Missoula County grant allows Seeley Lake to build a new ice rink

Missoula County awarded $39,000 in grants to fund park and recreation improvements and one of these grants went to the Seeley Lake Regional Outdoor Center for Kinetic Sports also known as Seeley Lake ROCKS to finish a new open air ice rink at their elementary school. After about ten years of hard work, the Seeley Lake community has finally raised enough money to build this ice rink and one of the main things they want to focus on is access. Seeley Lake ROCKS board member, Mike Lindemer, said they want people of all ages and abilities to use this ice rink. And the best part is, it’s free of charge and they even provide free skates for people to use. "It’s open to the public. We provide the tools for them to actually enjoy and learn to skate. We're talking about possibly having some skate clinics," explained Lindemer. Lindemer emphasized they want families to be able to learn how to skate and try new winter activities without having any restrictions, especially the young children in the community. "It’s just been something great for the kids to do you know. In the Seeley Lake winter time it’s like anything you can add to the mix is a blessing for the kids," said Seeley Lake Elementary Principal and Superintendent, Chris Stout. Students at Seeley Elementary have started playing hockey for P.E. class, and they've added after school hockey programs. But this wouldn't be possible without the continued support from board members like Lindemer who help maintain the ice rink. A place they want to become a community hub, a special project they've been working hard on for about a decade. "We have the kids right here. We can educate them. We also have cross country skiing. It's like a little Fort Missoula, but in Seeley Lake," emphasized Lindemer. And the work doesn't end here; the ultimate goal is to make this a covered ice rink. The four other grants which range from $1,500 to $12,000 will help fund projects to improve parks, trails, and recreation areas through the Parks and Trails Matching Grants Program.<end_of_turn>

# Beauty brands at CES, and KFC brings back the bowl haircut

Welcome to the latest edition of Marketer's Brief, a quick take on marketing news, moves and trends from Ad Age's reporters and editors. Send tips/suggestions to [email protected]  Procter & Gamble has new "Future You" technology that let's people preview what their face might look like in the future. Sounds scary. Find out more below, along with a new effort to crack down on misleading ads. But first, how KFC is seizing on the latest hairdo trend.  Free haircuts!  KFC is bringing back the bowl cut to promote bowls of food. We mean that literally: The fast-food chain will give free bowl haircuts Thursday afternoon at Ludlow Blunt in Brooklyn to promote its limited-time $3 KFC Famous Bowls. While the hairstyle isn't too popular, some stylists say it's poised for a comeback (you've been warned).  The haircut is a play on its branding: KFC is calling a straight-ahead bowl cut the "Original Recipe," according to a picture book KFC has published highlighting the hairdos. Another featured look is "The Spork & Bowl," with a spork-like style shaved into the back of the hairstyle. (If anyone takes KFC up on this, please, please send us before-and-after photos.)  Backstreet Boy Nick Carter tweeted the news this week. A KFC rep says the chain did not pay Carter for the plug.  Facetime  The future of beauty is now. Olay, in its first official appearance at CES, is showing people what their faces could look like way into the future. The Procter & Gamble Co. brand's "Future You Simulation" presents different scenarios—such as using sunscreen daily vs. no sunscreen use at all—and then shows you what your skin could look like should you not, you know, take care of it. The brand is also launching a smart wand, to be used with its existing Skin Advisor app, that would determine which ingredients your skin needs (e.g., peptides), and then apply them. And P&G Beauty is launching an AI-driven beauty platform, Setlist, to help women quantify, track and optimize their skincare routines. For more on P&G's techy innovations, check out our CES coverage.  New cop joins ad police beat  If you've watched too much TV, you might have found yourself wondering if testosterone supplement Nugenix can make former baseball star Frank Thomas look as studly as depicted, or even if it can do the same for you. Now there's a new industry self-regulatory program to help answer such deep questions. The Council of Better Business Bureaus has joined the Direct Selling Association to create the Direct Selling Self-Regulatory Council, a sort of National Advertising Division for the Veg-O-Matic world. This is probably a good idea as a lot of the group's time is already spent delving into questionable direct-response ad claims. "We know that direct selling has sometimes suffered from perceived problems, occasional bad actors, and others who pretend to be legitimate," says DSA CEO Joseph Mariano in a statement. "We have decided to address these issues directly, by holding companies to the highest standards with an effective third-party regimen."  Feel the power  January is supposedly a big month for fitness and Athleta is taking advantage of this with a new campaign that plays into its previous female-centric strategy. The Gap Inc.-owned brand is rolling out "She Who Pushes You, Powers You." Athleta will host classes in stores where consumers are encouraged to team up on challenges.  Something new  Remember that time David's Bridal aired its first TV commercial featuring a same-sex couple? You should, since it was only last week. The results are in and it looks like the move into more diversity in its marketing is paying off for the bridal chain, which filed for bankruptcy protection late last year. The ad, which showcases two women getting married along with other non-traditional brides, received an ABX Index rating of 106, or 6 percent over the norm. The index, compiled by ad tracking firm ABX, rates things like likability, awareness and recommendation. Mondelez makes a move  Mondelez International Inc., is the latest food marketer relocating to Chicago from the suburbs. The maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum plans to have about 400 employees work in a new building at 905 W. Fulton Market once its lease in suburban Deerfield expires in April 2020. Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office said 11 food companies have announced or moved headquarters to Chicago since 2011. They include Mondelez rivals Mars Wrigley and Ferrara Candy Co., as well as Mondelez's former sibling Kraft (now Kraft Heinz).  Pizza's here, and so is the beer  Pizza Hut continues to expand its beer delivery program, with beer eventually being available for delivery from nearly 300 restaurants across seven states. (Part of the expansion starts this month.) Pizza Hut offers 2-packs and 6-packs of Blue Moon, Bud Light, Budweiser, Busch Light, Coors Light, Corona Extra, Kilt Lifter, Michelob Ultra, Miller Lite, Miller High Life, Shock Top and Stella Artois. The expansion announcement could help Pizza Hut score some more business on Super Bowl Sunday, a huge day for the industry, in Pizza Hut's first season as an NFL sponsor.    A new recipe for Zwilling  After a website makeover last fall, culinary brand Zwilling J.A. Henkels is reaping the rewards. Working with digital agency Isobar, Zwilling switched its strategy by merging its six websites into one and focusing on kitchen experiences. The German brand, which operates a U.S. headquarters in Pleasantville, New York, reports a 21 percent increase in unique visitors to its site year-over-year and a 51 percent increase in e-commerce orders since the redesign.  Would you buy this?  Check out this brand mashup: Dunkin + Yoplait = a new yogurt that comes in Boston kreme, French vanilla latte, apple fritter and Cinnamon coffee roll flavors.  Number of the Week  $120 million: The amount Sears Chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert must have by 4 p.m. EST Wednesday in order to participate in an auction for the retailer.  Tweet of the week  Goose Island, the Chicago-based craft brewer, went on a Twitter rant after its hometown Bears blew Sunday's playoff game.   A lot of armchair kickers on here are saying that they could hit that field goal, which we find DOUBTFUL. You're gonna sit there on your throne of potato chips and vape pens and criticize this dude's athleticism? GET REAL. 2/5 — Goose Island Beer Co (@GooseIsland) January 7, 2019 Comings and goings  Persona, a startup that offers a personalized vitamin program, has appointed Cynthia Trumpey as CMO. Before joining the Seattle-based company, Trumpey was a senior marketing executive at Healthy Paws Pet Insurance.  Contributing: Jessica Wohl, E.J.

# India vs Australia: Would have been easy call to drop me, I wasn’t scoring runs, says Aaron Finch

Australia batsman Aaron Finch on Thursday said that his exclusion from the final Test against Australia would have been an easy choice considering he was unable to score any runs in the format. The opening batsman came under much criticism for his performance throughout the four-Test series against India in which he managed to score just 97 runs in 6 innings. Eventually, the right-handed batsman was dropped from the team in the 4th Test in Sydney and later was not recalled for the series against Sri Lanka as well.  Speaking to reporters in Sydney ahead of the first ODI, Finch said: “I hadn’t got any runs. That’s the reality. Two 50s in five Tests. I said this before when I got dropped from the one-day team, you’d like to have some bullets to fire back but there’s just none when you’ve made two 50s and average 16 for the series. I think it would have been a pretty easy call to be fair.”  The right-handed batsman further admitted he made a few mistakes with the willow during the series. “In the past I’ve been very good at being able to manage how much I hit, how much I train in terms of working on feeling good versus working on technique, trying to work on footwork patterns and stuff,” Finch said.  “It was my choice to keep hitting balls. You’re searching for form, you’re searching for something, and you don’t want to walk out after getting out in a Test match or a one-dayer, or anything, and think ‘jeez if only I had have hit some more balls’,” he added.  The batsman further admitted that he did not have the courage to “not bat” and stick around in the middle. “That was a really hard thing to do, to not bat. I know that I’ve had success not batting in the past. I just didn’t have the courage to stick to it,” he said.  Finch would lead Australia as captain in the upcoming three-match ODI series against India starting from Saturday.<end_of_turn>

# Tasca and Canarc Complete Princeton Gold Property Airborne Geophysics

Tasca and Canarc Complete Princeton Gold Property Airborne Geophysics VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / January 10, 2019 / Tasca Resources Ltd. ("Tasca" or the "Company") (TSX.V:TAC, FSE:3TA) is pleased to announce the completion of an airborne survey of its entire 14,650 hectare Princeton Gold Property.The survey was funded by joint venture partner Canarc Resource Corp..Results from the survey will be released once the report and data have been received from geophysical contractor Peter E.Walcott and Associates Ltd.    Tasca acquired the Princeton Gold Property in September 2016 to further explore 2010 and 2011 discoveries, where float grab and in-place quartz rock sampling documented 25 of 37 samples returning gold values in excess of 1,000 parts per billion with 13 of the 25 samples returning gold values in excess of 10,000 ppb gold, or 10 grams per tonne, to a maximum of 66,237 ppb or 66.2 grams per tonne gold.    Tasca subsequently completed a fall 2018 excavator trenching program (see TAC News Release dated 26-November-2018) tracing the 2010 and 2011 in place quartz veining and boulder over 120 metres along strike.Highlights from the program include: The most significant result from this program is a quartz vein assaying 217 grams per tonne gold over 0.9 metre.A second sample three metres along the vein ran 99.7 g/t gold also over 0.9 metre. Two angular quartz float samples assayed 115.5 g/t gold and 108.5 g/t Au. The 2018 trenching program combined with the 2011 surface program has resulted in the collection of 53 in-place or angular quartz vein samples.Thirty-eight of the samples exceeded one g/t gold, with 24 of the 38 exceeding 10 g/t gold to a maximum of 217 g/t gold. The zone was traced over 120 metres; overburden exceeded the six-metre reach of the excavator. Tasca cautions investors float samples are grab samples and may not be representative of mineralization on the Princeton property.  Based on the excavator trenching results, Tasca initiated a staking program expanding the property size from 4,013 hectares to 14,650 hectares.Tasca then entered in to the option agreement with Canarc to fast track exploration on the property.Canarc and Tasca agreed the next step was to evaluate the entire property package, looking for repeats of the quartz vein zones.The airborne magnetic survey was then initiated. The Princeton Gold Property is underlain by both Eocene Princeton Group volcanics and Triassic Jurassic Nicola Group volcanics.While there is little historical evidence of mineral discoveries in the Princeton Group volcanics, recent mapping by the British Columbia Geological Survey and by Tasca geologists suggests the quartz vein mineralization is hosted or intimately related to the Princeton volcanics.  About Tasca Resources  Tasca Resources Ltd.(TAC: TSX-V; FWB: 3TA) is a Canadian-based mineral exploration company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.Our objective is to build shareholder value through exploration and potential development or acquisition of existing projects with significant up-side.

# Teacher suspended at North West's Laerskool Schweizer-Reneke amid race row

A teacher from Laerskool Schweizer-Reneke in the North West was suspended on Thursday January 10 following outrage over a picture she allegedly took of Grade R pupils in her class being seated separately from their white classmates on their first day of school. The announcement was made by the North West department of education during a meeting at the school following demonstrations by community and political groups at the school. The department said the teacher had been suspended with immediate effect. TimesLIVE has learnt that an investigation into the school’s principal was also being carried out. North West Education MEC Sello Lehari on Thursday visited the school‚ following the uproar caused by an image of Grade R pupils who were separated by race on their first day of school on Wednesday. On Thursday morning‚ parents of both white and black pupils as well as political party members gathered outside the school. A group of parents of white pupils drove over the school fence with their vehicles and took away their children‚ saying they were rescuing them from angry protesters. One white parent said: “If you are not happy here‚ take your child to another school‚ nobody is forcing you. Now they want to make this as if it’s racism. Everyone just wants to make white people racists. We are not racists‚ we just want what is best for our children.” Another parent said: “This is the only white-dominated school in this town. There are over 10 schools at the township. If they are not happy‚ let them take their children there.” Black residents said they have been complaining about racism at the school for over a decade. “I remember in 2008‚ we left township schools at that time and protested at this school because we wanted this [racial segregation] to end as this is also a government school‚” one resident said.<end_of_turn>

# HTC: No 3D TV? Then you won't want a 3D phone

With the HTC Evo 3D UK release date falling in July or August – just a month or so after the HTC Sensation hit our shelves – you'd be forgiven for thinking that HTC could be doing itself out of some high-end sales. But that's not how HTC sees it, arguing that, although spec-wise the Sensation and Evo 3D are very similar beasts, what they offer is quite different. Graham Wheeler, director of commercialization and product management at HTC, explained at a press briefing that TechRadar attended: "We see the Evo 3D as future-proofing and helping to drive the 3D market ahead. "3D won't necessarily come to all products, but we do see more 3D products coming – we'll save future announcements for the future." 3D TV When asked if HTC thought that the Evo 3D would steal some of the newly-released Sensation's potential sales, he answered: "The Sensation is quite different – it feels smaller, more tactile; whereas the Evo 3D is a serious media phone. It's very much a camera-phone. "But if you don't already have a 3D [television] screen in your home, you probably won't want one."<end_of_turn>

# Over 20 Burned Bodies Found on US-Mexico Border - Reports

Mexican authorities have found the charred remains of 21 people in the state of Tamaulipas on the border with the United States, NDTV reported.  The burned bodies, presumably victims of a battle between drug cartels, were found next to seven burnt cars near the border town of Ciudad Miguel Aleman, about 270 kilometres (170 miles) from McAllen, Texas, a city Donald Trump was due to visit.  According to state police spokesman Luis Rodriguez, it is believed that gunmen from the Gulf Cartel had fought with members of the Northeast Cartel.  Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Mexico during last years of fighting among cartels and between the criminals and security forces. The cartels vie for control of drug trafficking and extortion rackets and have been known to exploit migrants.  Since deployed the army to crack down on drug cartels in 2006, more than 200,000 people have been murdered in related violence; 28,711 were slain in 2017, a grim record which preliminary estimates indicate was beaten in 2018. For comparison's sake, the number of murders in the US, which is far more populous, was 17,284 in 2017, according to FBI data.<end_of_turn>

# Commuters Riding The Rails As TEXRail Line Begins Service

FORT WORTH (CBSDFW.COM) – After a slight ‘derailment’ of its scheduled launch, the new TEXRrail service between downtown Fort Worth and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport is back on track and service began this morning.  Some riders got up early and were lined up at the station in Fort Worth, ready to board the commuter line before sunrise.  TEXRrail originally planned to launch the service January 5, but had to delay it due to a signal issue, in addition to the partial government shutdown.  Earlier this week, inspectors with the Federal Railroad Administration approved the entire 27-mile route for passenger service.  The $1 billion TEXRail project has been more than a decade in the making and will make nine stops along the route. Trains will operate almost non-stop, seven days a week, except for a few early morning hours.  A CBS 11 News crew was onboard the train Thursday morning and talked with the line’s first rider. “I think it’s going to be good for the community, great for the airport, great for Fort Worth,’ said Steve Krum. “It’s been a long time coming. It’s well deserved.”  The line runs from downtown Fort Worth, across Tarrant County, through North Richland Hills and Grapevine, and into DFW Airport.  For some riders taking the train will be all about convenience, but Krum said there are other benefits too. “It’s an economical way to travel. It take pollutants out of the air and it’s a use of mass transit.”  Tickets prices begin at $2.50, but TEXRail is offering free rides for everyone through January 31.<end_of_turn>

# Evergreen Siddle reveals secrets behind ODI recall

Evergreen Siddle reveals secrets behind ODI recall  There were still a handful of hours to go in 2018 when Peter Siddle made good on his New Year's resolution.  The lion-hearted paceman hadn't played one-day cricket for Australia for more than eight years but his form for the Strikers had caught the attention of the national selectors and there were some whispers that he was a possibility of getting a recall.  The rumours caught Siddle off guard because he'd virtually given up hope of playing limited overs cricket for Australia again.  But he decided to have a crack at making it back in 2019, and figured the New Year's Eve BBL match against the Sydney Thunder was as good a time as any to push his credentials.  Playing in front of a huge crowd at Adelaide Oval and a massive national television audience, Siddle knew it was golden opportunity to make a big impression.  And that's exactly what he did, capturing the vital wickets of England Test skipper Joe Root and his vice-captain Jos Buttler to win the game and the man-of-the-match award.  "I knew if I put in a good performance it could mean a lot," Siddle said.  "I did and got the phone call."      At 34 Siddle is no spring chicken but, at the same time the selectors are looking for youthful talent, it was his experience that got him back in the side.  The Australians have been struggling to contain opposing sides in the final overs and needed a reliable bowler to bowl at the death.  Siddle has always a been a reliable, hard worker who could bowl long, tidy spells but has emerged as one of the most clinical closers in the BBL and that is just what the selectors want.  "If there's ever a good way to learn fast, how to develop skills in white-ball cricket, it's definitely the T20 format," he said.  "You have to learn quickly, learn on your feet and if you don't execute the deliveries and skills you have, you obviously cop it a lot in the shortest format."      Siddle understands that one of the main reasons he was picked for the three match ODI series against India is because Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood are all being rested, but he also knows that if he does play well he can push for a spot in the World Cup squad.  "We may not be at full strength, missing a few players we'd probably like to have for the World Cup, but at the same time it's opportunities," he said.  "With those World Cup spots up for grabs for a lot of people you definitely see the best come out for a lot of blokes in the squad and that's exciting."

# South London rapper Octavian named BBC Music’s Sound Of 2019 winner - Independent.ie

South London rapper Octavian named BBC Music’s Sound Of 2019 winner  The honour was previously won by Adele and Sam Smith.  South London rapper Octavian has been crowned the winner of BBC Music’s Sound Of 2019.  The 23-year-old, who was once homeless and dropped out of the famous Brit School aged 14, said it will be “a very loud year for me” after winning the prestigious award.  Previous winners include Adele, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding.  Octavian said: “I get inspired and I try to make a new sound every day. It’s going to be a very loud year for me. Loads of music, loads of visuals, loads of albums.”  The rapper, who counts Drake among his fans, was born in France but raised in London.  He was chosen by a 136-strong panel made up of Radio 1 DJs, industry experts and artists including Goulding as well as previous alumni including last year’s winner Sigrid.  Octavian’s music blends styles from house, rap and drill to R&B, dancehall, grime and UK hip-hop.  He released his first full-length mixtape Spaceman last year. He won the Sound Of 2019 poll ahead of Spanish singer Rosalia, Brooklyn-born vocalist King Princess, Grace Carter and Northampton rapper SlowThai.  Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac said: “BBC Sound Of is always a wonderful opportunity to get a snapshot of the new music landscape in the UK and this year is really interesting. Six of the 10 artists are women.  “And we have two rappers in the top five. I am delighted that UK rap music has got such great placement in the list – Octavian is a truly original and exciting artist, pushing the boundaries of the genre and it’s great to see such a progressive artist getting such a huge accolade.”  Press Association<end_of_turn>

# High flying entrepreneur puts her success down to being vegan

Entrepreneur and Team GB athlete who runs a £5M snack business claims being VEGAN is the secret to her success as it makes her 'mentally sharper' (and she's never touched a drop of alcohol in her life) Lisa Gawthorne, 37,from Liverpool, has been a been a vegan since 2002 She also competes for team GB in duathlons and trains regularly at the gym Says her plant-based diet, rich in nutrients, gives her energy and keeps her sharp An athlete who started her own multi-million pound snack business has seen her turnover double in the past year as the lifestyle choice grows in popularity. Lisa Gawthorne, 37, from Liverpool, runs snack company Bravura Foods, and also competes for team GB, running and cycling all over the world in duathlons. It's certainly a hectic lifestyle, but Lisa puts her success down to her vegan diet as it gives her boundless energy, and never touching a drop of alcohol in her life. 'My diet helps me to feel very sharp and focused, when you run your own business you need that – it has paved the way for me to remain quite driven and committed,' she told Femail. Lisa, who also gave up coffee in 2007, has seen her business go from strength to strength since she adopted a plant-based diet in 2012 - a year after she set up her company. She said: 'Last year we grew 50 per cent in the market - going from a £2.5m business to a £4.8m one.' Lisa Gawthorne, 37, from Liverpool, runs vegan snack company Bravura Foods, but also competes for team GB, running and cycling all over the world in duathalons The businesswoman, who has also written a nutrition book, says her plant based diet, rich in nutrients, gives her boundless amounts of energy. Lisa, who had been a vegetarian from the age of six, says that her choice to go vegan was about animal welfare. She said: 'I went vegetarian when I saw a leaflet about battery hen farming. It made me not want you to eat meat and even when my parents put animal meat on my plate and I declined to eat it.' But going vegan, back in 2012 was much harder: 'Back then there wasn't much food to choose from - there was only things like only tofu and soy on the market. So it was real challenge to begin with, but today we’ve never had so much choice.' The one big change was her energy levels: 'I saw them shoot through the roof when I became a vegan. 'Everyone who meets me says that I’m full of beans and they think I take energy tablets, but its all down to my diet.' Lisa became a vegan 17 years ago and has seen her energy levels 'shoot through the roof' She says that her diet helps her to stay focused which she needs for running a business Lisa launched her company, Bravura Foods, an ethical food and drink distribution company business, in 2011 with business partner Carl Morris. Starting with vegetarian and vegan brand Panda Liquorice she says their the aim was to go after brands that they believed in. They now work with other vegan and vegetarian snacks and food brands like Peanut Hottie and Free from Fellows. Lisa, who eats a high protein diet, and mixes it was meat substitutes like tempeh and tofu, leafy greens, vegetables, good carbs and essential fatty acids in avocados and nuts, says that it's this diet that keeps her mentally alert. Lisa launched her company, Bravura Foods, an ethical food and drink distribution company business, in 2011 with business partner Carl Morris Lisa said that she fell into the duathlons by accident initially using running as a stress reliever As well as running a successful company Lisa also competes for Great Britain in duathlons. The athlete, who says he has never drunk alcohol said: 'I fell into the duathlon world by accident, I was always a runner and used it as stress reliever. 'But when I had a running injury my physio told me to get on the bike to help it – and fell in love with cycling.' In 2016 she did her first duathalon and did so well that she qualified for the European championships. Then at her second race she qualified for the world championships in Canada. Lisa says that those who are contemplating taking on veganism shouldn't be worried when it comes to their diet. She said: 'Don't be scared to try it out, there is a minority people out there who say you won't get your nutrients, but I have never been deficient in any vitamins.' Lisa adds: 'There has never been a better time to go vegan, in the last couple of years I've been tasting things that I never thought I would, like vegan shepherds pie, cupcakes, cheesecake.'<end_of_turn>

# Scottish student's mental health story goes viral as she shares uplifting Tweet

Chloe Sheridan, who studies in Dundee, shared the emotional Tweet charting her personal journey to the social media platform.  The Essex-born student told how three years ago she was admitted into a psychiatric ward for the first time.  She said she felt lost, hopeless and consumed by the idea of ending her life at that time.  But the Tweet ended with the revelation that she was now returning to a psychiatric ward - this time as a student mental health nurse.  She also shared two photos - the first showed her looking downcast and teary-eyed in a grey hoodie as she prepared to go into hospital as a psychiatric patient.  The second pic showed her beaming and looking professional in her grey nurses scrubs.  She posted: "Three years ago today I was taken into a psychiatric ward for the 1st time.  "I was lost, hopeless, consumed by the idea of ending my life.  "Today I walk into a psychiatric ward as a student mental health nurse for my first day of placement.  "Things change, they don’t stay hard forever."  And Chloe's life-affirming tweet quickly racked up support and likes as her story went viral across the platform.  Her tweet has garnered up almost 20,000 retweets and over 130,000 likes since it was posted.  Thousands more replied with messages thanking Chloe for her honesty.  One wrote: "From someone who struggles daily with Mental Health issues and needs the help/support MH workers provide, a massive thank you for your decision to work with others who need that help.  "You will be an asset to all you work with and I wish you all the best."  Another said: "This is amazing!! Best tweet I’ve seen for ages. So glad you managed to get through it and your first hand experience and understanding will be invaluable. Best of luck in your career - I’m sure you’ll be fantastic!!"  One posted: "Literally in the same position as you. 4 years ago I was in hospital for taking an overdose and seeing no way out of my hell of a life. I’m now a student mental health nurse and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been."  And another added: "I feel this. I was in and out of hospitals with mental health issues and struggled for a long time. This is brilliant! well done!! 4 years ago I was in sectioned in hospital and this year, 5 years later I will qualify as a mental health nurse! I can’t speak for anyone else, but using my experience and illness to do this truly gave me my spark back."<end_of_turn>

# Bernie Sanders apologizes to female staffers after reports of sexual harassment by 2016 campaign colleagues - Jewish Telegraphic Agency

(JTA) — Sen. Bernie Sanders apologized Thursday to female staffers on his 2016 presidential campaign who said they were harassed by male co-workers.  The apology followed a Politico report saying that Sanders’ former Iowa campaign manager and adviser Robert Becker forcibly kissed a young campaign worker and has been accused of similar harassment by other female campaign workers.  Becker, 50, also was named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees, Politico reported. The political magazine said it viewed the settlements but that the two employees are restricted from talking about the case.  Sanders, a Vermont Independent who caucuses with Democrats, told reporters that he thanked the women “from the bottom of my heart for speaking out” and apologized to them, The Washington Post reported.  “When we talk about ending sexism, and ending all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words,” Sanders said. “They must be based in day-to-day reality and the work that we do. And that was clearly not the case in the 2016 campaign. The allegations that I have heard speak to unacceptable behavior that must not be tolerated in any campaign or in any workplace.”  Sanders said he was not aware of the $30,000 settlement.  Becker, after overseeing the Iowa campaign, then helped lead the Jewish senator’s efforts in Michigan, California and New York as deputy national field director. He reportedly made an unauthorized trip to South Carolina recently to recruit staffers for a possible 2020 presidential campaign by Sanders and had contacted women whom he had allegedly harassed.  Sanders, 77, has yet to announce whether he will run, but Friends of Bernie Sanders, his principal campaign committee, said in a statement that Becker would not be part of any future campaigns.  In an interview last week with CNN — after female staffers requested a meeting to discuss the harassment allegations as well as pay disparities — Sanders apologized “to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately. And of course, if I run, we will do better next time.”  He said he was not aware of the allegations because “I was little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case.”  Sanders was the first Jewish candidate to win major-party nominating contests. He ultimately failed in his 2016 bid, losing the Democratic presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump defeated Clinton in the general election.<end_of_turn>

# Great Lakes icebreaking season kicks off

The U.S. Coast Guard kicked off its annual icebreaking operations on the Great Lakes to ensure that lake freighters can continue to haul iron ore from Minnesota and Michigan to Northwest Indiana's steel mills and that other maritime commerce can continue through the winter months. U.S. Coast Guard Sector Sault Sainte Marie started Operation Taconite to break through ice in the commercial ports of western Lake Superior and the St. Marys River, a key passage that enables ore boats from the Minnesota Iron Range move from Lake Superior into Lake Huron, so they can gain access to Lake Michigan. It's the U.S. Coast Guard's largest domestic icebreaking operation and has been ongoing since 1936, when President Franklin Roosevelt ordered it “to assist in keeping open to navigation by means of icebreaking operations, in so far as practicable, and as the exigencies may require, channels and harbors in accordance with the reasonable demands of commerce.” Coast Guard cutters press down on ice cover on the Great Lakes, breaking it up to clear way for boats headed to points including the Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor and the steel mills that ring the southern shore of Lake Michigan in Northwest Indiana. "Operation Taconite encompasses Lake Superior, St. Marys River, Straits of Mackinac, Georgian Bay, Green Bay, northern Lake Huron, and Lake Michigan," the U.S. Coast Guard said in a press release. Beyond facilitating commercial navigation after the Great Lakes freeze over, the Coast Guard icebreakers also engage in search and rescue operations, help out ships stuck in deteriorating weather conditions, and respond to community emergencies, including providing flood control services or medical assistance. Though this winter has been relatively mild, it is not apparent how much the Great Lakes are frozen over. The National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration normally reports real-time ice coverage over the Great Lakes, but is not currently doing so because of the partial federal government shutdown.<end_of_turn>

# Why is Jamie's Italian in Exeter's Princesshay still empty?

It's been almost two years since Jamie's Italian closed in Princesshay amid a massive restructure for the chain fronted by chef Jamie Oliver.  Opened in 2015 by Jamie's mentor Gennarro Contaldo, the chain promised an authentic taste of Italy.  But two years later, customers had fallen out of love with the brand.  The Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group recorded losses of nearly £10million - leading to the closure in Exeter and later Bath and Bristol.  It's been tough for the mid-market restaurants. Last year, the likes of Frankie and Benny's, Byron Burger, which is a fellow Princesshay stable mate and Prezzo, which closed in Exeter's High Street also showed financial strain.  Nick Turk, retail director for the South West and Wales at Colliers International, said: "The general feeling is that life is not too good for the mid-market restaurants at the moment. There have been a lot of them and the mediocre ones have not been able to cut it."  Nick Farrant, Partner & Head of Food & Drink PKF Francis Clark agreed: "Such closures are the result, ultimately, of empty restaurants or at least those which are not sufficiently full to weather the following financial headwinds that are facing restaurants."  DevonLive Business takes a look at five reasons Jamie's Italian remains empty  1. Too expensive for independents  Last year's dining crunch had a chilling effect on restaurant openings and we saw a reduction in the number of outlets for the biggest brands. We don't know for sure what kind of rent Jamie's Italian was paying on this restaurant but it has been reported that it was in the region of £185,000 a year. In his first interview after the Exeter closure, Jamie Oliver told Mail Online: ""We had parts of the business that were inefficient, we were in places we shouldn’t have been, there were rents we shouldn’t have agreed to."  Overheads are high for restaurants even before they've opened the doors, for things like business rates, an increase in the minimum wage and ingredients. It means that a site as large as this is unlikely to be taken up by an independent restaurant or small chain.  Mr Farrant, said: "Not only are there overall revenue pressures, but substantial rises in operational costs have had a negative impact on many restaurants. The weakness of the Pound during 2018 for example, having led to increased ingredients costs."  Mr Turk added: "Some landlords of big retail centres recognise the value of having independents in the mix and will offer a rent based on the turnover of the business for a number of years and a percentage if it exceeds that.  "It means you get the interesting mix that people want."  2. Too much competition  Jamie's Italian was in the heart of Princesshay's dining quarter which means there are plenty of alternatives for the customer to choose. There's Carluccio's, Byron Burger, Cafe Rouge, Coal, Yo Sushi and Wagamama's.  "Over-capacity in the market is undoubtedly a factor – the previous decade having been a period of significant expansion in the number of eateries, particularly roll-outs of new restaurant chains," said Mr Farrant.  Mr Turk said: "There are too many mid market restaurants in Exeter for the current spending patterns of customers."  3. Wobbles over Debenhams?  Debenhams towers over Bedford Street and is a keystone of the Princesshay Shopping Centre. Prospective tenants for the old Jamie's Italian site would naturally be concerned for what the future holds for the department store.  The past year has been tough, with plans to close 50 stores, though there has been no indication that Exeter is among them.  The gloom has been compounded by a fall in sales during the crucial Christmas trading period.  Debenhams reported a 5.7% fall in like-for-like sales in the 18 weeks to 5 January and in the shorter trading period, the six weeks to 5 January, like-for-like sales - which strip out changes to stores - were down 3.4%.  Sergio Bucher, chief executive of Debenhams, said the number of customers across the UK "had been weak".  Mr Turk said that any interest in the site would weigh up what's happening around it.  He said: "People want to eat out in a place that's bustling and in the heart of things. No-one is going to say: 'Let's go and eat at that place next to where the Debenhams has closed."  Bedford Street is also set to lose its Post Office, which is a footfall driver. It's set to downsize and relocate to the WH Smith on Queen Street.  4. Habits have changed  People are feeling a bit cautious, they don't do out so much and when they do, are looking for more of an experience than the generic brands can offer.  Mr Turk said: "After the recession, there was a rise in millennials eating out once or twice a week but habits and fashions have changed. Most recently because of Brexit uncertainty, people are eating out less."  He said that diners are looking for 'pizazz'. When Bristol's Jamie's Italian closed, it was replaced by an independent piano bar with a late licence serving cocktails.  Mr Turk said: "People are more discerning now, they want something extra from a night out."  5. High Streets are changing  Last year's retail reports by Grimsey and Timpson concluded that there are too many shops on the High Street and that probably goes for restaurants too.  People are increasingly shopping online and want to come into the city for an experience. Expect to see more leisure activities in the city centre, like gyms, escape rooms and entertainment venues.<end_of_turn>

# OPEC is not the enemy of the US, UAE minister says

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is not the enemy of the United States, United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said on Saturday in Abu Dhabi. “We are complementing each other, we are not enemies here,” he told an industry news conference in Abu Dhabi, addressing the relationship between OPEC and major consuming countries, like the United States. OPEC and other leading global oil producers led by Russia agreed in December to cut their combined oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day in order to balance the oil market starting from January. The decision came despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s calls to oil exporters to refrain from cutting production, saying it would trigger higher oil prices worldwide. (This story corrects the spelling of the minister’s name) Reporting by Rania El Gamal and Maha El Dahan; Writing by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Kirsten Donovan<end_of_turn>

# Alzheimer Society raises flag for awareness at city hall in Cornwall

The executive director of the Alzheimer Society of Cornwall and District is excited about this year’s national awareness campaign. “What’s cool about this year is the information is coming directly from the experts, the people living (with dementia) each day,” said Shelley Vaillancourt, just after being joined by Cornwall Mayor Bernadette Clement at city hall on Thursday afternoon to commemorate January as Alzheimer’s Awareness Month with a raising of the society’s flag. This year’s campaign is focusing on people living with dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, and erasing the stigma. The campaign title is: “Yes. I live with dementia. Let me help you understand.” “We’re turning the conversation over to the experts,” said Pauline Tardif, CEO at the Alzheimer Society of Canada. “We believe sharing stories of Canadians living with dementia will fuel a more open, supportive and inclusive dialogue around dementia.” There is work to be done. In a 2017 online survey commissioned by the Alzheimer Society, 51 per cent of Canadians admitted they had used derogatory or stigmatizing language about dementia; about 30 per cent of those said they had told dementia-related jokes. Related More than half a million Canadians are living with dementia. Dementia is a general term referring to a variety of brain disorders, and the number of people affected is expected to grow to over 900,000 in the next 15 years. Vaillancourt said there are 3,600 people in the five local counties who are living with dementia. “That number will double by 2031,” she said. But Cornwall is a dementia-friendly community, and more and more businesses and organizations are getting on board. “We’re willing to (work with) organizations and businesses, if they touch base with us,” Vaillancourt said. Free training is available until March 31 of this year, and more information can be obtained by contacting Vaillancourt at 613-932-4914 ext. 204, or email alzheimered@one-mail.on.ca. Also note that the Soup’s On fundraising event for the Alzheimer Society is Jan. 22 at the civic complex. The Alzheimer Society is a nationwide, not-for-profit network of provincial and local societies and volunteers. The Cornwall and District chapter was established in 1985 as a self-help group, and it received charitable status in 1986. The chapter serves SD&G, Akwesasne, Prescott and Russell.<end_of_turn>

# Saturday was a ‘big thank you’ from Joseph, the Tigers

For Clemson linebacker Kendall Joseph, Saturday’s Championship Celebration was a different feeling than the one the Tigers had in 2016.  “The 2016 was so surreal and this one, I don’t know, it is different,” the senior said as he was leaving Death Valley on Saturday. “I guess maybe me being older makes it a little different because I am having to move on, but overall after putting in all the hard work and it paying off, that is the same feeling.”  Joseph and the Tigers celebrated their 44-16 win over Alabama in the national championship game with about 50,000 fans at Memorial Stadium on Saturday. They celebrated the fact they not only won the national championship, but the fact they became the first team in the modern era to go 15-0 in major college football.  The last one to do it was Penn back in 1897.  “It was just a big thank you (today),” Joseph said. “We could not have done any of this without the fans, the coaching staff and everybody, so we wanted to let everybody know that we appreciated them.”  Joseph finished his last year at Clemson second on the team with 81 tackles, five tackles for loss and four sacks. He also added seven quarterback pressures.  The weakside backer was part of a senior class that finished 55-4, tied with ‘Bama as the winningest senor class in the history of college football. They played in three national championship games and won two of them. They also won four ACC Championships and played in four College Football Playoffs.  The senior will now head to Florida to get ready for the NFL Draft.<end_of_turn>

# Asian Cup 2019: Stephen Constantine - Sunil Chhetri is the Messi of India | Goal.com

Indian national team coach Stephen Constantine was full of praise on striker Sunil Chhetri who recently overtook Lionel Messi in the number of international goals scored.  The 34-year-old has 67 goals for India and trails Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo by 18 goals. Chhetri is set to equal Bhaichung Bhutia’s record of highest appearances for India at 107.  “You compare Chhetri and Messi. I would say that he is the Messi of India. He’s a fantastic player, he keeps scoring at the international level and for his club on a regular basis. He’s been a great player for India for I don’t know how many years. I hope that continues to be this way,” said the 56-year-old.  Constantine reiterated that his side will go for three points against Bahrain in their final Group A fixture on Monday evening at the Al-Sharjah Stadium, Sharjah. However, a draw would be enough to ensure that the Blue Tigers progress into the knockout stages of the competition, a feat which they haven’t achieved since 1964.  “We will not be playing for a draw. We will go for a win. We don’t know how to play for a draw. It’s not something that is in mine or the players’ head. We are here to win,” signed off Constantine.<end_of_turn>

# CapitaLand leads Singapore REIT consolidation with $4.4 billion purchase from Temasek | MarketScreener

CapitaLand will buy the holding companies of the business of the Ascendas-Singbridge Group, which manages Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust, Ascendas India Trust and Ascendas Hospitality Trust, for cash and stock. The deal marks one of the biggest consolidations in Singapore's fragmented real estate investment trust sector, in which some segments, like retail, face increased challenges, partly due to the onslaught of e-commerce. The deal will create a group with combined total assets under management of more than S$116 billion ($85.81 billion), CapitaLand and Ascendas-Singbridge said in a joint statement on Monday. Real estate developer CapitaLand's global businesses span shopping malls, lodging, offices, homes, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and funds. The deal will push CapitaLand ahead of its target to grow its assets under management to S$100 billion by 2020. Ascendas-Singbridge is mainly a business space provider, such as logistics and business parks, as well as data centres. "Geographically, the deal strengthens CapitaLand's presence in our core markets of Singapore and China, while adding meaningful scale in India, U.S. and Europe," Chief Executive Lee Chee Koon said in a statement. The deal also gives the company a strong foothold in logistics and business parks. "In an increasingly competitive global retail landscape environment, this consolidation will help scale and competitiveness for the companies," said a person familiar with the transaction. The target companies have a combined enterprise value of S$10.9 billion. Under the agreement, Temasek will effectively receive about S$6 billion, half in cash and half in new CapitaLand shares, which will be priced at S$3.50 a piece. After the deal closes, Temasek's stake in CapitaLand will increase to about 51 percent, from about 40.8 percent. With Temasek owning stakes in both acquiring and target companies, the deal must receive approval from CapitaLand's independent shareholders. Trading in shares of CapitaLand, some of its listed REITs, and Ascendas-Singbridge's REITs, was halted ahead of the announcement.

# Scotland County at Salisbury Week 1 FNF

Scotland County at Salisbury Week 1 FNF  Related Story  
The Salisbury Panthers are coming off an outstanding season that concluded with an 8-2 record, and with 17 starters returning, there's no reason this season shouldn't be another dandy one. Even though last season ended too abruptly, with a loss to rival Marceline, the experience that many of the returning players received will prove invaluable. Head Coach Mitchell Green will guide the Panthers in his first season at the helm, though he has been an assistant at the school for the past six seasons. "We had young players step up and show they are ready to play," Coach Green said. "They played hard every game and made it exciting to coach and watch. We came up a little short at the end of the season." On the offensive side of the ball, the Panthers return All-District quarterback Brady Francis (6-3, 170), who is coming off an outstanding season in which he passed for 1,116 yards and ran for another 640. He's worked hard this offseason and Coach Green knows he can count on Brady Francis to be a leader on and off the field. His favorite target figures to be senior tight end Keegan Wyatt (6-5, 240), who was named to the All-Conference, All-District and All-State teams last season after recording 315 receiving yards. At wide receiver, senior Kyle Hinkle (6-2, 170) is back and wants to have an impact on the offense in his final season of high school ball. Sophomore Garrett Francis (6-1, 150) will also play wide receiver, along with fellow sophomore Spencer Bloss (5-9, 145). The Panthers have an impressive rushing attack led by senior Daniel Linneman (5-9, 165), who rushed for 961 yards on his way to being named to the All-Conference and All-District teams. He also had 135 receiving yards out of the backfield. He's the type of speedy, shifty player who keeps defensive coordinators awake at night -- as is his partner in crime Jordan Clark (5-10, 150), who was named to the All-Conference team as a utility player last season. He had 387 rushing yards and 267 receiving yards. Up front, the Panthers are fortunate to have an experienced offensive line, anchored by All-Conference performer Luke Armentrout (6-3, 195), a senior. He played well last season and has been hitting the weights this off-season. Luke Armentrout will start at tackle, as well newcomer Devon Bennett (6-1, 230), a junior. Senior Tristan Farnen (6-1, 180) and junior Cole Fuemmeler (5-10, 195) will both start at guard, while senior Brendan Vasser (5-7, 215) will play center. "We have a lot of team speed which will help spread our offense out," Coach Green said. "We can give the ball to multiple people who can make plays. I think we should have success out of the backfield and through the air." The Panthers will run multiple formations for a balanced attack. It will be impressive if the offense can match the 38 points per game it averaged last season. Like a lot of high school teams, the Panthers have quite a few two-way players. Defensive back Brady Francis was named to the All-Conference, All-District and All-State teams last season after recording an impressive 42 tackles and eight interceptions. After observing what he does on both sides of the ball, it's not ridiculous to say he is one of the best players in the conference. He'll be joined at defensive back by Jordan Clark, who had 17 tackles last season, Kyle Hinkle, who had 25 of his own. Garrett Francis is also expected to start at defensive back. The linebacking corps will be led by Like Armentrout, who had 51 tackles and four interceptions last season, on his way to being named to the All-Conference and All-District teams. Tristan Farnen was also named to the All-Conference team as a linebacker after recording 42 tackles of his own. Daniel Linneman will start after adding 27 tackles of his own and Cory Hinkle and senior Josh Cole will also see some time at linebacker. Up front, the defensive line is led by All-Conference performer Cole Fuemmeler, a defensive end who had 43 tackles and six sacks in 2013. Not to be outdone, senior Keegan Wyatt had 38 tackles and five sacks of his own at defensive end. He, too, was named to the All-Conference team. "We do not have the size we are used to having so our speed is going to be big on defense," Coach Green said. "We will have to fly around and tackle well as a team." Coach Green is excited for his shot to be a head coach of a successful program. "I want to be the best conditioned and most physical team every week," he said "I want my players to play with a purpose and play smart. "It should be an exciting season, we have a bunch of returning players who are good players and have experience on Friday nights," he continued. "We also have a lot of young talent who can step in and make plays." Pigskin's Pick: 7-2<end_of_turn>

# Short sinks languishing Melbourne Stars

The Melbourne Stars continued their now three-game losing streak on Monday night, suffering their biggest defeat to the Hobart Hurricanes, who were led by a unbeaten match-winning D'Arcy Short innings of 96 from 56 balls at the MCG. Short's knock, which paved the way for the Hurricanes' 59-run victory, was the highest score of the BBL season – and it would have been a ton had he not been robbed of a boundary wrongly deemed leg byes by the umpire. The silver lining for the Stars is that they have endured their final outing without Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Peter Handscomb and Adam Zampa, who are all set to return from the Australian ODI camp for the Melbourne derby on Saturday. The Stars, who remain at the bottom of the league ladder, have lost all three matches without the quartet. Electing to bowl, the Stars begun well, limiting openers Matthew Wade and Short with a leg-side field and tight bowling. Wade, given two lives in his innings, was well caught by Ben Dunk in the deep for 41. Once Wade was dismissed, Short attacked the Stars' bowlers with vigorous intent, using his power and timing to muscle the ball to all points of the MCG outfield, often taking steps down leg-side in anticipation of the straight ball. Spinners Liam Bowe and Tom O'Connell, making his debut, were taken full advantage of by the Hurricanes' top order, O'Connell going for six off his first ball. Short's innings set the Stars an almost unattainable total. Opener Evan Gulbis gave away his wicket cheaply on four runs, while his fellow top-order batsmen Dunk (20 from 14) and Nick Larkin (16 from 13) failed to capitalise on solid starts. When Maddinson (6 from 7) went out lbw, leaving his side at 4/51, the Stars looked in deep trouble. Dwayne Bravo (19 from 16) and Seb Gotch (35 from 26) scored quickly while trying to breathe life into the match, but Riley Meredith took the key wicket of Bravo to end the partnership. The Stars' innings then petered out, with Meredith (4) and Johan Botha (2) and Jofra Archer (2) taking multiple wickets each to clean up the tail. After facing the Renegades this Saturday, the Stars remain in Melbourne for matches against the Adelaide Strikers and Brisbane Heat. The Hurricanes head into a testing stint on the road, taking on the Perth Scorchers, Adelaide Strikers and Sydney Sixers away from home.<end_of_turn>

# Togo: FIFA President Honoured During Togo Visit

Following an earlier visit to Mauritania, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, CAF Vice President Constant Omari, FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura, FIFA Director of Member Associations and Development for CAF and the Caribbean Region Véron Mosengo-Omba, Development Manager at the FIFA Regional Office for West and Central Africa El Hadj Wack Diop and members of the FIFA administration yesterday travelled to the Togolese Republic.  Upon landing at Lomé-Tokoin International Airport, Infantino was bestowed with a traditional honour and rank on behalf of President Faure Gnassingbé and presented with traditional Togolese robes to mark the occasion.  Speaking about his elevation to this rank, the FIFA President said: "I am hugely humbled to be considered worthy of being a traditional authority of Togo. The warmth, passion and joie de vivre of the Togolese people is contagious and I am immensely honoured that President Gnassingbé has bestowed this prestigious rank upon me."  The FIFA delegation was then escorted by Minister of Sport Guy Madjé Lorenzo and Togolese Football Association (FTF) President Colonel Guy Kossi Akpovy to the Presidential Palace of Togo for a meeting with President Gnassingbé, a passionate football fan. Discussions then took place on the educational aspects of football and the people of Togo's love of the game.  FIFA's Football for Schools Programme, which will provide a platform to educate children through football, was also a key focus of the dialogue and Infantino briefed President Gnassingbé on FIFA's plans to distribute nine million footballs to schools in the territories of the 211 member associations around the world. In addition, an online platform will be created to inform teachers on how best to incorporate football into education.  During the meeting, President Gnassingbé expressed his gratitude to Infantino for having kept his electoral campaign promise of increasing the number of African teams that will participate in the 2026 FIFA World Cup™. He also expressed his delight that Infantino had honoured Africa by appointing a secretary general from the continent. The head of state reinforced his commitment to continue supporting football across the country via funds provided to the FTF.  A media session followed the meeting with President Gnassingbé, in which Infantino emphasised the importance of FIFA's continued support to the FTF in order to promote and grow football in the region for men and women. He said: "I'm very positive about the great impact that the allocation of dedicated funds through the FIFA Forward Programme will have on women's football in Togo. I'm looking forward to seeing how women's football will expand and flourish here and provide great opportunities to girls and women to get involved in the game both on and off the pitch."  The next meeting scheduled for the FIFA delegation was with various Togolese football stakeholders, including the FTF and its President Kossi Akpovy, its Executive Committee, Claude Le Roy--the coach of the Togolese national team--as well as representatives from various clubs and leagues. The main topics discussed were the need to continue developing football in Togo as well as the many opportunities and challenges the game faces in the country. The FIFA President stressed to those present his satisfaction on the positive direction in which the FTF was moving under the leadership of President Akpovy and the need to join forces with FIFA to sustain these efforts.  The delegation was then invited to an official dinner hosted by outgoing Togolese Prime Minister Komi Sélom Klassou that featured local singers and traditional Bassar dancers.<end_of_turn>

# Chrissy Teigen Stuns at the Critics’ Choice Awards, Claims Attending Was a ‘Huge Mistake’

Chrissy Teigen and husband John Legend partied the night away at the EGOT winner’s star-studded James Bond-themed 40th birthday party last night at their home in Beverly Hills, Calif. Now, the model-turned-cookbook author is regretting agreeing to attend the 24th Critics’ Choice Awards tonight.  Teigen took to Twitter earlier this evening, writing, “why oh why god did I agree to the people or critics choice whatever it is the night after John’s party this was a big mistake huge yes this is a fancy problem.” That said, she hit the blue carpet alongside her man in a stunning white strapless dress featuring a waist embellishment and a thigh-high slit.   Teigen pulled her head-turning look together with statement earrings, a sparkly silver clutch bag and slinky silver metallic sandals. For makeup, she slicked her shorter ‘do back and donned a dark lip to complement her man’s ensemble. Legend looked sharp in a brown printed suit complete with a turtleneck and Christian Louboutin’s Thomas III fall ’18 lace-up shoes.  The 33-year-old mom of two also posted a sultry video to Twitter in which she laments her decision to attend the awards. “This was a huge mistake,” she says, laughing in the background.

# HP Pavilion dm1-4027ea

The HP Pavilion dm1-4027ea comes at an interesting time for portable PC laptops. Traditional laptops have had a turbulent ride of late, with a number of threats appearing to erode their market. The first threat - netbooks - has been seen off pretty comprehensively. The diminutive machines offered a smaller, lighter and cheaper alternative, but at the cost of power and features. In the end netbooks failed to capture the public's imagination, despite the efforts of some great products, such as the Toshiba NB520-10U. Tablets, however - especially the Apple iPad 2 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 - haven't had this problem, and have surpassed netbooks to become the laptop's biggest threat. Sales have rocketed so that tablets have succeeded where netbooks failed. Offering slick interfaces, a huge selection of apps and usually attractive and portable designs, tablets are a force to be reckoned with. Their Achilles' heel at the moment is price. Top range tablets go for around £300-£400. You can get cheaper models, such as the Binatone HomeSurf 705 and ViewSonic ViewPad 7e, but they're not very good. A new front has now opened up from the high end of the laptop market, with Intel's ultrabook format. These new laptops are incredibly thin, light and beautifully designed, as well as being powerful. The standout models of ultrabook is the Asus Zenbook UX31 and the Acer Aspire S3. So where does this competition leave standard laptops in general, and the HP Pavilion dm1-4027ea in particular? Does it do enough to stand out in an already crowded market, and does the audience for that market even exist any more? The HP Pavilion dm1-4027ea starts with a strong foundation, with Hewlett Packard remaining a trusted and respected manufacturer of laptops. The HP Pavilion dm1-4027ea's stablemate, the HP Pavilion dm1-3100sa, has impressed as an ultra-portable laptop that doesn't make too many sacrifices when it comes to performance. But now the spotlight is firmly on the HP Pavilion dm1-4027ea.<end_of_turn>

# Kwara Cricket Association holds schools tourney April - Vanguard News Nigeria

The Kwara Cricket Association has begun preparations toward the hosting of the Easter Holiday Cricket competition for secondary schools in the state.  This was part of the resolutions reached at the end of a one-day meeting of the association in Ilorin on Tuesday.  To ensure that the competition scheduled for April is hitch-free, the association said it would give a face-lift to the cricket pitch and make it appropriate to host the event.  Mr Emmanuel Obafemi, the First Vice Chairman of the association, had already taken up the responsibility of clearing the cricket pitch and returning it to an acceptable standard.  It was also agreed that school masters representing the 16 secondary schools involved should be engaged in coaching and officiating courses from Monday.  The association also agreed that this would be carried out in conjunction with the Nigeria Cricket Federation.  The association’s Technical Director, Wale Obalola, told the meeting that the duo of Abdulqadri Taiwo and Samson Rachael had been called up to the national team and were expected to take part in a bilateral series against Rwanda.  Obalola also said that Abolarin Rasheed was also named as part of the National Under-19 junior male team.  He said the state was capable of producing even more young talents with the necessary assistance and support. (NAN)<end_of_turn>

# From draper to being knighted: New history talk to shine light on life of Hartlepool’s Sir William Gray

An upcoming event will give a fascinating insight into the life of one of the most important figures in Hartlepool’s history – Sir William Gray.  Local history enthusiast Frances Wilson will give a talk titled ‘Sir William Gray – The Man, The Draper and the Gray Legacy to Hartlepool’ at Community Hub Central in York Road on Thursday January 31. Born near Blyth in Northumberland in 1823, William Gray moved to Hartlepool’s Headland at the age of 20 to start his own drapery business, following in the footsteps of his father Matthew. In 1862 he was elected Mayor of Hartlepool. The following year after selling his drapers business he formed a partnership with local shipbuilder John Punshon Denton, creating Denton, Gray and Co. In 1887-88 he became the first Mayor of West Hartlepool – the only Mayor of both towns – and in 1890 he was knighted by Queen Victoria for his services to the two towns and industry. He died in 1898 leaving a fortune worth over £93m in today’s terms. His younger son William Cresswell Gray inherited the family business. Jackie Johnson, library officer at Community Hub Central, said: “Much has rightly been written about the Gray company’s ships, but this talk will focus more on Sir William’s life in general, his shops and the wider contribution the Gray family made to the town – including Sir William’s substantial role in civic life and his many philanthropic activities.” The talk is on from 2pm to 3.30pm and is part of the Hub’s regular CHAT adult social group. Admission is £1 per person but places must be booked in advance on (01429) 272905 or emailing central.library@hartlepool.gov.uk<end_of_turn>

# Mozambique: Chang Should Stand Trial, Says Tomas Salomao

Maputo — Former Mozambican Finance Minister Tomas Salomao has expressed his indignation and disappointment at the involvement of one of his successors. Manuel Chang, in the scandal of Mozambique's "hidden debts".  Salomao served in the governments headed by President Joaquim Chissano in the 1990s, first as Finance Minister and later as Transport Minister. He receives part of the credit for stabilising the Mozambican economy in that period.  Salomao later served for ten years as Executive Secretary of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). He is currently chairperson of Standard Bank-Mozambique and a member of the Political Commission of the ruling Frelimo Party.  Interviewed by Radio Mozambique, Salomao stressed that a Finance Minister is "the State's treasurer", and so his behaviour should be beyond reproach.  "In his capacity as public treasurer, this minister is absolutely prohibited - I repeat, absolutely prohibited - from using any asset belonging to the public treasury for his personal benefit. That's absolutely forbidden", stressed Salomao.  Salomao though it important that Chang should stand trial for his alleged crimes - though he did not much care in which country the trial would take place.  Currently Chang is in police custody in Johannesburg. He was detained at OR Tambo International Airport while he was on his way to Dubai on 29 December, on the basis of an international arrest warrant from the United States. The US authorities want to extradite Chang to New York, where he faces charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, wire fraud and securities fraud.  Salomao insisted that Chang should be tried "whether in Mozambique, in South Africa, in the United States, or at the Hague (headquarters of the International Criminal Court). He will be tried somewhere. And it's good that he be put on trial, so that this serves as an example and as a reference point, so that this sort of thing is not repeated. Those who dare to act like this should be punished in an exemplary way".  But what was most important, Salomao added, was that the institutions of the administration of justice should work to ensure that stolen money should return to Mozambique.  "What most concerns me, as a citizen of this country", he said, "is that the institutions of justice, after dealing with all those who were involved in this crime and hatched this Machiavellian operation, should, once they have been judged, prove capable of recovering the money that ended up in undue accounts".  "This money, these assets, should be recovered by the public treasury", Salomao stressed.  The question of paying off the debts illicitly incurred in 2013 and 2014, when Chang signed guarantee notes for over two billion dollars of loans from the banks Credit Suisse and VTB of Russia, was something that could be dealt with later, he said, leaving open the possibility of Mozambique not repaying any of these debts.  After dealing with those responsible for financial crimes, and recovering whatever money could be recovered, "we shall discuss whether Mozambique has anything to pay or not", he said. "Perhaps we shall reach the conclusion that we as a country, we as citizens of this country, have no debt to pay".<end_of_turn>

# Old Patriot-News building under demolition

It’s a slow process, but the former Patriot-News building is coming down. The demolition project started in October and is taking place over the course of a few months as crews wrap up asbestos abatement and tear down the building at 812 Market St., Harrisburg. Much of the roof and brick wall has been stripped away from the third floor. Holes throughout expose caverns in what was once office space, overhead lights dangling like ancient stalactites. The sidewalk is blocked off with caution tape and a large, first-floor window is broken out. On one side, the loading dock is stripped away, leaving a peak into the building, where for more than 50 years, reporters broke news and editors burned the midnight oil to get the newspaper onto doorsteps. The building is now owned by the Public School Employees’ Retirement System, which was conducting a study of what should go in its place. It was purchased first by a New York commercial real estate company, Twenty Lake Holdings in June 2017 for $644,286. L & B Realty Advisers LLP, a Dallas-based real estate investment advisor, then purchased the building from Twenty Lake Holdings for $1.6 million on Dec. 20, 2017, according to Dauphin County records. PSERS announced in January 2017 that L & B Realty Advisers LLP made the purchase on its behalf.<end_of_turn>

# How to use your frequent flyer miles for the most value while travelling abroad

How to use your frequent flyer miles for the most value while travelling abroad The simmering debate always is about when to use your flyer miles and when to use money Over the years, I have listened patiently to many a folks who have argued that the frequent flyer miles they have collected are not useful at all. I understand the frustration but if you were to understand how these programmes work and how you could get the most value for your miles, perhaps it would make it easier for you to use your miles. Frequent flyer programmes are marketing programmes by design, but also similar to an investment account or a bank account by nature. You earn miles for various activities including taking flights, using your credit card, shopping, etc. However, when it comes to using your miles, the rules are different. Most airlines do not offer all the seats on a flight towards mileage redemption. Out of the hundreds of seats available on any given flight, airlines would usually offer redemption seats in the single digits. So, theoretically, that means not everyone can use their miles for redemptions on the same flight. But the good part is, when you can use your miles towards a redemption ticket, you can shave off the entire cost of the ticket and use that money towards other travel expenses or experiences. For instance, you don’t have to pay ₹ 1.25 lakh for a business class ticket (one-way) to London, your miles would do just fine. Hence, earning and burning miles towards travel, requires a shift in thought process, and adjusting to a few new realities as compared to shopping for tickets in cash. Airlines generally tend to sell tickets almost a year in advance. They also start accepting reservations for miles redemption seats at about the same time. So, if you are looking for an award seat, especially in business class or first class, 11 months before your travel date is the time to start looking at the airline websites to see what is available. The obvious retort is: “Who plans a trip so early?” Given that mileage tickets are limited, people who get them first, do get to keep them. So, the earlier you start planning, the more chance you have at a redemption ticket. Flexibility is of prime importance as well. Someone else could upend you to get the seats on the flight you wanted. In that case, be a little flexible, and look for other flights and you could still be going where you have to go. Another thing that gets frequently missed out is redemptions across airlines. For instance, Air India is a member of the Star Alliance, which makes available the inventory of all the 28 Star Alliance member airlines. This ability to book tickets for miles on other airlines could come handy for international travellers to save a lot of money. Would you want to spend $200 on a flight between New York and Washington DC, or use 7,500 miles from British Airways for a redemption ticket and $5 towards statutory fees? I think the answer is obvious. The other simmering debate always is about when to use your miles and when to use money. From how I look at it, miles provide a large arbitrage opportunity over money for premium cabin tickets. For instance, you could spend ₹ 1.5 lakh towards economy class round-trip tickets for two for a special trip, such as a honeymoon, between India and Europe, or you could spend 2 lakh miles and ₹ 12,000 towards a round trip ticket in first class (on LifeMiles redemptions). This is possible because most airlines price their business class tickets in cash at four or fives times of economy and then first class even , but when it comes to mileage programmes, business class tickets are twice the price of economy, and first class a little than that. The different rules for use of miles over cash tickets can also come to your rescue many a times. Business travellers would have suffered at the hand of airlines having to buy one-way tickets internationally, which are almost as expensive as round trip tickets. And many a times a last-minute ticket could be at prices that make everyone cry. However, when it comes to mileage tickets, the rules dictate a set price for every route, so these prices don’t change due to closeness to departure or other commercial ticketing rules. For those of you who like to travel smart and save money at the same time, with a bit of flexibility and patience, you can indulge without having to pay the exorbitant price that comes with it.

# Brits in EU demand to be spared from Brexit 'train crash' after May's deal rejected

A huge majority of UK parliamentarians rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday evening, leaving the government's plan for the UK's exit from the EU in tatters and the future of 1.2 million Brits in Europe shrouded in yet more doubt.  More than two thirds of MPs voted against the Brexit deal, known as the Withdrawal Agreement. The numbers represented a crushing defeat for the PM: 202 voted in favour of the agreement but a staggering 432 MPs voted against.   This is the biggest defeat in British political history in the last hundred years. The previous record was 166. Our time is NOW. Join the fight: https://t.co/5oM0unY4kH — Best For Britain (@BestForBritain) January 15, 2019 The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn seized on the government's massive defeat, the largest for any government since the 1920s, to call for a vote of no-confidence.  MPs will now debate whether they have confidence in May's government on Wednesday January 16th.  Jean-Claude Juncker returned to Brussels early from meetings in Strasbourg, with May expected to seek a new round of meetings with the EU Commission and EU leaders to thrash out a new deal.  But Juncker was not hopeful.  "The risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the UK has increased with this evening's vote. While we do not want this to happen, we will continue our contingency work to help ensure EU is fully prepared," Juncker said in a statement shortly after the vote.  Donald Tusk, the European Council president, outlined the Brexit impasse and suggested Brexit should be called off for the good of both the EU and the UK.   If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is? — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) January 15, 2019 While campaigners for the rights of the 1.2 million Britons in Europe expected the result their anger at being left in limbo by negotiators for 934 days was heightened by May's statement after the defeat.  Kalba Meadows from British in Europe and Remain in France Together told The Local: "There was no great surprise in the result but the sheer hypocrisy in Theresa May's statement afterwards was just breathtaking when she said 'People, particularly EU citizens who have made their home here and UK citizens living in the EU, deserve clarity on these questions as soon as possible.'  "We've been asking for clarity for over two years now, and neither she nor any of the DExEU Secretaries of State have been willing to meet us.  "I doubt there's one single EU citizen in the UK or UK citizen in the EU that didn't choke on those words. If she really wants to give us certainty, then she must push hard for the ring-fencing of our rights and do so now. It's the only just solution. Human lives must be taken out of this train crash"   How dare Theresa May say we need clarity. She has refused to ever meet us. Her Secretaries of State have refused to meet us. Do not use us now to prop up your position. — British in Europe (@BritishInEurope) January 15, 2019 The group British in Italy were similarly outraged.   Theresa May has lost the vote tonight. She now needs to ask the EU to commit, together with her government, to implement what they both painstakingly agreed on citizens’ rights last year in an international treaty - whatever happens next. 1/ pic.twitter.com/HuRuLMLEPi — British in Europe (@BritishInEurope) January 15, 2019 Citizens' rights campaigners called on Theresa May, who name-checked UK nationals in Europe shortly after the heavy defeat in parliament, to return to Brussels and strike a deal for their rights.  But Theresa May may not be in a position to renegotiate any deal. First of all her government has to survive Wednesday's confidence vote.  It may be a long time yet before Britons in Europe get any clarity over their futures.<end_of_turn>

# Mueller: Manafort worked behind scenes to stock Trump administration

Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, was working through mystery intermediaries in January 2017 to get people appointed in President Donald Trump’s new administration, according to a court filing released Tuesday.  Manafort described the hiring effort to Rick Gates, his longtime deputy, who in turn revealed the clandestine outreach to special counsel Robert Mueller’s team after pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate with investigators to lessen his own sentence. Story Continued Below  According to Gates, Manafort continued speaking with the unidentified people — their names are redacted in the court filing submitted by Mueller’s prosecutors — through about February 2018, several months after the longtime GOP operative had first been indicted in the special counsel’s Russia inquiry on charges of money laundering, making false statements and other crimes.  Manafort was convicted on eight felony charges in August and is awaiting sentencing. In a deal with Mueller, he also pleaded guilty in September and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel.  It’s unclear whether Manafort was successful in his effort to stock the Trump administration with allies. But the new detail, which Mueller’s office indicated in the Tuesday court filing has been relayed to a federal grand jury, adds to the potential legal quagmire already swirling around Trump and his associates.  Mueller accused Manafort of lying to his prosecutors in late November, and since then has been providing the court with evidence about the new suite of charges, which are expected to be a factor when a Washington-based federal judge sentences Manafort in March.  In Tuesday’s court filing, FBI special agent Jeffrey Weiland provided more information about the fact-challenged statements Manafort allegedly made over the course of 12 meetings with Mueller’s prosecutors, as well as two visits last fall to the grand jury. Mueller’s team also produced a 157-page document of exhibits making their case, though nearly everything in the file is blacked out.  Much of Weiland’s 31-page statement includes heavy redactions that make it difficult to fully decipher what Manafort is accused of lying about to the Mueller team, though previous court filings indicate the breaches include his contacts with the Trump administration and Konstantin Kilimnik, a Ukrainian associate who has ties to Russian intelligence.  Weiland’s statement does provide additional details surrounding a May 26, 2018, text exchange that Manafort had with an unidentified third party who was asking permission to use Manafort’s name as an introduction in case the person met Trump.  “If I see POTUS one on one next week am I ok to remind him of our relationship?” the person texted Manafort, according to Weiland’s statement.  Manafort responded “[y]es” and “[e]even if not one on one,” according to Weiland’s statement, which also said Manafort confirmed the interactions in his own grand jury testimony.  Also Tuesday, Mueller reported to the court that Gates “continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations” and again asked for a delay in the former Trump deputy’s sentencing. The federal judge presiding over Gates’ case agreed to the special counsel’s request to circle back on March 15 with another status update.  Attorneys for Manafort are not directly challenging Mueller’s charges that their client lied during his cooperation with the special counsel. Instead, they maintain that all of his misstatements “were not intentional” and happened only because he wasn’t prepared for his meetings with the special counsel, which began days before he pleaded guilty and continued in earnest on the day after his Sept. 14 plea hearing.  Last week, Manafort’s lawyers failed to properly redact some of the sealed materials in their own filings and revealed details about what their client was accused of lying about, including his sharing of Trump campaign polling data with Kilimnik that has raised alarm among legal experts about possible collusion between Russia and the campaign. Manafort is known to have had other contacts with Trump’s team after his ouster from the campaign, despite the scrutiny he drew for his work for Kremlin-connected politicians and businessmen in Eastern Europe — the same issues on which he’d later face charges in the Mueller probe.  POLITICO previously reported that Manafort called Trump’s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, about a week after the presidential inauguration with strategic advice about how to fight back against the controversy swirling around the new administration over its campaign contacts with Russia.  It’s also not the first time Manafort has been linked to discussions of trying to help people get jobs in a Trump administration.  During his criminal trial last summer in Virginia on bank and tax fraud charges, Mueller’s prosecutors presented evidence that the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago agreed to lend Manafort $9.5 million following an unusual dinner in New York between Manafort and the bank CEO, Stephen Calk.  The bank’s senior vice president, Dennis Raico, testified with a grant of immunity from Mueller’s team that Calk had asked him to contact Manafort after the dinner to inquire about a possible senior role in Trump’s administration, including secretary of Treasury or the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  While a jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted Manafort on five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and a single count of failing to file foreign bank account reports, the jury deadlocked on the count related to the Chicago bank loan.  Manafort is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 8 by U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis for his convictions stemming from the Northern Virginia trial. He also faces a March 5 sentencing in Washington for his separate guilty plea with Mueller on conspiracy against the U.S. and conspiracy to obstruct justice.<end_of_turn>

# Burnaby federal byelection big for residents, bigger for NDP leader

Byelection could become referendum on Trudeau government or turn on local issues.  For Daniel Walczak, one issue stands taller than all others as he and other Burnaby residents decide who to vote for in a federal byelection that at least one candidate wants framed as a test of Justin Trudeau’s record as prime minister. That issue, broadly, is the economy, and more specifically, political stances on major development projects like the Trans Mountain Pipeline. “I’d like less pushback on the pipeline,” said Walczak, a local construction worker. “For my future, I hope I get a good paying job in oil, logging, anything. I just want a high-paying job. That would be good for me.” Walczak stopped for an interview on Monday morning outside the byelection campaign headquarters of federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. Singh is among those who have announced their candidacy for the seat left vacant in Burnaby South by former MP and now Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart. As a federal party leader, he has taken the approach of battling the prime minister at the same time as appealing to local residents, recently telling them “Mr. Trudeau isn’t acting on the best interest of the people of Burnaby but rather he’s focused on the best interest of his own political party.”  Walczak said he was likely to vote in the byelection for Jay Shin, a corporate lawyer who is running with the Conservative Party of Canada. “Jay Shin will fight for lower taxes and I think (Conservative Leader) Andrew Scheer’s reliable, so I think I can trust that,” Walczak said. It was only last week that Trudeau set Feb. 25 as the date for byelections in Burnaby South, York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Quebec, but Walczak already knew by name each hopeful in his riding. Also contesting for the Burnaby South seat are day-care operator Karen Wang for the Liberal Party of Canada and former talk-show host Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson for the People’s Party of Canada. Many other residents Postmedia spoke to outside Singh’s campaign office were unsure who was running in the byelection, and several didn’t recognize the NDP leader’s name when they saw it written on his campaign signs. Others said or indicated they did not speak English. More than 50 per cent of Burnaby South residents are immigrants, according to Statistics Canada census data. Nearly 18 per cent of residents state their ethnicity as Asian, another nearly 15 per cent state east and southeast Asian, nearly 11 per cent state Chinese, and less than nine per cent state European origins. It is a well-educated riding, with more than 72 per cent of residents holding a postsecondary certificate, diploma or degree, according to the 2016 census. Hamish Telford, an associate professor of political science at the University of the Fraser Valley, said the byelection is important for citizens of Burnaby South to have their views represented in Parliament, but for Singh it is essential.  “I think Jagmeet Singh has a vested interest in focusing on the big picture here and trying to make this a referendum on the Trudeau government,” he said. But byelections can easily be taken over by local interests, and at this point it is not clear which way this one will go, he said. As for Singh’s competitors, “they need to establish a really strong ground game,” Telford said. “They need a team, and they’ve got to work their party lists, they’ve got to work their phones, they’ve got to work their networking connections in the community … to get the vote out.” While most residents passing by Singh’s campaign headquarters were unable to name their preferred candidate, they were able to list issues that were important to them. Princess Narag said affordable child care was foremost on her mind as a voter, and Chantal Richard said support for the local film industry was key for her. Telford said the outcome of a byelection can be hard to predict given that a relatively small segment of the population tends to show up at the polls. “It’s really a question of who comes out to vote that day, which segment of the population gets motivated to do it. And that’s enormously hard to predict.” With files from Nathan Griffiths and Jennifer Saltman. Related  CLICK HERE to report a typo. Is there more to this story?

# Sutton woman’s Range Rover stolen in suspected keyless entry theft

Sutton woman’s white £30k Range Rover Evoque she received for Christmas stolen in suspected keyless theft  FACEBOOK / NICOLA SULMAN  A Sutton woman’s white £30,000 Range Rover that was given to her as a Christmas present has been stolen from her home.  Nicola Sulman woke up this morning (January 16) to find her Range Rover Evoque was missing from outside of her house. The luxury car was stolen in a suspected keyless entry theft – this is where someone duplicates the signal of the driver’s key to gain entry to the vehicle. Ms Sulman said that their front door does not have a letter box to prevent the theft of her car keys. She said: “We came down in the morning and I called the police straight away. There was no glass on the floor and no one heard anything.” “I got the car only six weeks ago and it was given to me as a Christmas present. My neighbour leaves at 4.30am so I know it was taken before then.” A spokesman for Cambridgeshire Police said: “We received reports at 6.51am this morning of a stolen Range Rover Evoque in white.” If you spot the car, registration N111 XJP, you should call police on 101. If you saw anything suspicious notify the police quoting incident 57 of 16.01.2019.<end_of_turn>

# Monika Billen: body of missing German tourist believed found in Australian outback

The body of the missing German tourist Monika Billen is believed to have been found in the East MacDonnell Ranges outside Alice Springs.  Billen was last seen around Emily Gap in the ranges on the afternoon of New Year’s Day but a witness told investigators she had given her a ride the day before.  On Thursday, Northern Territory police located a body believed to be that of the 62-year-old during aerial searches.  In a statement, Superintendent Pauline Vicary said police found the body at 3.15pm under a tree and off a track 2.9km west of Emily Gap.  Authorities were contacted on 8 January after Billen failed to check out of her hotel and board a flight to Darwin.  “Police received additional information from Ms Billen’s telecommunications provider and continued with aerial searches in specific areas for the past two days,” Vicary said.  Northern Territory police had using drones, remote aircraft and motorbikes to search for Billen.  NT police previously said CCTV footage from 1 January clearly showed Billen walking out the front of the resort on Barrett Drive and later south along the Todd River. They said brochures in Billen’s hotel room suggested she may have been interested in walking local trails, including the Larapinta trail.  Police have contacted the family.  “It is deeply upsetting that we have to tell her family this sad news but we are relieved to be able to provide them with answers,” Vicary said.  A report will be prepared for the coroner.<end_of_turn>

# That which binds us together is greater than that which...

As South Africans, we have come a long way with our transformation agenda and project since 1990. We had secret talks, then we engaged in talks about talks, and finally, we agreed to negotiate a settlement among all races. We produced an outcome and the world called it a miracle. We overcame many obstacles over the years and we continue to overcome.  In my previous column, I mentioned that we as South Africans must start having the inconvenient conversation about race, privileges and prejudices. I insisted we start this conversation because the elephant — of the race — remains in each and every room in Mzansi. I realised that besides having to deal effectively with our own identity politics in South Africa, we too are global citizens. Which does beg the question, how does the world view us these days, 25 years after the fall of apartheid?  Race matters in South Africa and we must have the inconvenient conversation.  In many ways, we all subscribe to the famous Dan Vera poem:  The Borders are Fluid Within Us  This is what is feared: 
that flags do not nourish the blood, 
that history is not glorious or truthful. 
I sleep and dream in two languages. 
I gain wisdom from more than one fountain. 
I pass between borders 
made to control what is owned. 
The body cannot be owned. 
The land cannot be owned, 
only misunderstood or named by its knowing. In short, according to me, prejudices must fall and we are all global citizens. But do we all agree with these sentiments? Looking at the intolerance that is still projected daily in this country, can we truly say the miracle still holds? Can we agree that the agreeable overtones in the early 1990s are no more? What happened then?  Do I hear some of you saying that the black man should simply get on with it and should stop having a sense of entitlement? That 25 years on, shouldn’t he/she have something to show for it?  Well, Doctor Martin Luther King was once asked why the black man in America doesn’t just lift himself up by his bootstraps, as all other immigrants did. His response, I reckon, holds true for our context in South Africa as well. He said to the journalist:  “White America must see that no other ethnic group has been a slave on American soil. That is one thing that other immigrant groups haven’t had to face. The other thing is that the negro’s colour became a stigma. American society made the negro’s colour a stigma.  “Though slaves were freed in 1863 they gave the slaves no land or nothing in reality to get started on. At the same time, America was giving away millions of acres of land in the West and the Midwest. Which meant there was a willingness to give the white peasants from Europe an economic base. And yet it refused to give its black peasants from Africa who came here involuntarily, in chains, and had worked free for 244 years, any kind of economic base.  “So, emancipation for the negro was really freedom to hunger. It was freedom to the winds and rains of heaven. It was freedom without food to eat or land to cultivate and therefore, freedom and famine at the same time.  “And so when white Americans tell the Negro to lift himself by his bootstraps they don’t look over the legacy of slavery and segregation.  “Now, I believe we ought to do all we can and seek to lift ourselves by our own bootstraps, but it’s a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps. And many Negroes, by the thousands and millions, have been left bootless as a result of all of these years of oppression and as a result of a society that deliberately made his colour a stigma and something worthless and degrading.”  Back in South Africa, I’m sure the world still holds a largely positive view of our beautiful country. They visit in their millions annually, and we as a country have very good relations with most foreign governments. But there is a concern out there, will the centre hold? We have made good progress with regard to investments into the economy over the last year, prosecutions are unfolding with regard to corruption and yes, the economy did grow marginally at just over 2% in the last quarter.  However, it remains up to all of us to return to that spirit of ubuntu we displayed in the 1990s if we are to progress.  As the 2019 general election approaches, how will you do your part? Will you ask, how am I affected and what can I do? Or will you continue to pretend that none of these issues affects you and that all is well in Mzansi?  Happiness and dignity are what black South Africans want desperately, how and what will we do to make these a reality.  Only together can we achieve greatness. As Barack Obama says, we have a stake in one another… what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart.

# Annual fishing tournament reels in the big ones

Annual fishing tournament reels in the big ones  IF YOU'VE ever wanted to catch a huge one-metre-plus barramundi then this weekend could be your chance.  You might win a prize for your efforts, even if you don't catch a fish.  Barrabasstasstic Family Fishing Tournament organiser Russell Nowland said conditions at Lake Awoonga would be ideal.  "The temperature and moon phase is perfect for barra fishing," he said.  "There's lots of good fish in Awoonga at the moment, the big fish are definitely there.  "There's a lot of fish around the 90cm-plus mark and this year we're expecting to see a few over the metre mark.  "Honestly, you couldn't ask for better conditions than this weekend."  The annual tournament has been running for 17 years and Mr Nowland said he was hoping this weekend's event would be the biggest and best.  "Last year we had about 40 entrants and we're expecting more this year," he said.  "There are a lot of people travelling to Lake Awoonga from all over Queensland, including Australian Fishing Champion Geoff Newby.  "The event attracts serious anglers and a lot of families who join in for some fun.  "People can come down and sign-up any time between now and midday Saturday at our stall in front of the Lake Awoonga Caravan Park.  "It's $70 for adults and $15 for juniors and there will be plenty of prizes on offer for all the categories, including biggest barra, most fish caught, runners- up and even the smallest barra.  "Even if you don't catch anything you might win something in the lucky-prize draw on Sunday."  Mr Nowland said the competition was a catch-and-release event.  "We don't use bait only lures and this year will be the first time we've used the Track My Fish fishing app so people will be able to have a look at what's going on at Awoonga in real time," he said.  Mr Nowland admitted he had never been lucky enough to pull a one-metre-plus barramundi into his boat.  "You haven't lived until you've caught a big one over a metre," Mr Nowland said.  "But this year, it's my turn."<end_of_turn>

# UCR Multidisciplinary Research Building opens following Friday dedication - Highlander

On Friday Jan. 11, UCR’s Multidisciplinary Research Building (MRB1) was officially opened for campus use following a formal dedication led by Chancellor Kim Wilcox, Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Cynthia Larive and UCR architect Jacqueline Norman. The $116 million, 179,000 square-foot facility is one of many firsts for the campus, including an entrepreneurial-focused ‘incubator’ space, LEED Platinum certification and the campus’ first building dedicated solely for multidisciplinary research with an emphasis on eight research teams in biological, medical, information and physical science fields.  The ceremony opened with Larive’s recognition of the dedication’s large attendance of community members, faculty, administrators and even elected officials. Those acknowledged by name were California Senator Richard Roth, California Assembly Members Jose Medina and Sabrina Cervantes, Riverside Mayor Rusty Bailey and Riverside City Council Member Andy Melendrez. Following the recognition of elected officials, Larive called upon all task force members and foundation trustees involved in the success of the project to stand in order to be lauded for their efforts.  Following the ceremonial introduction, Norman took to the podium to express her feelings about the massive and expedited three-and-a-half year project: “We at UCR are deeply appreciative of the collaborative relationship that thrives … a thrilling culture of rigor, excellence, and respect permeated the entire process surrounding this project from the beginning to end and in my mind represents what is best about UCR.” Norman shared that she hopes the research conducted at this new facility will have an impact beyond our campus, quoting architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in her closing statement: “Let this building be the home of ideas and adventure.”  Larive briefly took the stage once more, further explaining the function of the MRB1 and how administrators ultimately narrowed down 22 proposed research teams into the eight which will occupy the facility: “While it is a beautiful building, and the analogy to a cathedral is apt, it will be a very functional building. It will help to raise the research activity and the research profile of UCR.” Explaining the research which will take place, Larive affirmed “we went through several rounds of review and we finally got it down to eight different teams.” The teams in question are ‘Data Science Center,’ ‘Environmental Toxicology Group,’ ‘Food, Bugs, Guts & Brains,’ and ‘Imaging,’ among others.  The final speaker of the day was Wilcox, who shared a few words on the building’s nature as a “bridge,” and how it looks towards the future with a legacy in mind: “It isn’t about one topic, it isn’t about one area of the campus, it isn’t about one department or college. It’s about the future, and everyone in science will tell you the future is about collaboration and multidisciplinary work.”  Wilcox explained that the science is the focus, but the building itself will serve an additional purpose for the UCR campus: “It’s also a building all about bridges. It bridges between the disciplines, of course, but it also bridges other ways. It bridges to the community, Riverside has long-needed wet-lab incubator space. We’re going to have public entrepreneurs in and out of our building everyday.” In his closing statement, the chancellor advised that “while this is an important building of firsts, it is equally important in that it ties together so many parts of the past. For me, I think about the future. Every one of our buildings on campus, at some time, somebody stood like me and dedicated it and no one in the room could have imagined what might have gone on there … what might happen in this building in 2035, or 2043, or 2062? There will be people in this building that we have never met, who are going to be working on topics we have never heard of, making discoveries that will make a difference for history, forevermore.”  The Multidisciplinary Research Building is located across from the Aberdeen-Inverness residence halls and is adjacent to the Material Sciences building near the Bourns College.<end_of_turn>

# Get a 21-minute look at Fox's new X-Files with this behind-the-scenes tease - Pocket-lint

The X-Files is set to premiere next month - 13 years after the original ended. Fox's new miniseries, which will consist of six episodes, has been teased a lot in recent months, thanks to set photos, trailers, and more, but we still don't know much about what to expect from the show. That is, until now. A new 21-minute behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming series has just been published to The X-Files YouTube channel. The video's description on YouTube clearly explains what the new featurette is all about: "Go behind the scenes with Chris Carter, David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson and all the key players as they reveal secrets from the set and take you on the epic journey of bringing this classic series back to Fox". Watch it, below, to see some spoilers. You'll also learn about how series creator Chris Carter brought newbie Joel McHale on board after seeing his performance at a White House Correspondent's Dinner. Carter further talks about the structure of the mini-series; he said the first and last episodes focus on the show's mythology and main story arcs. The other four episodes will see Mulder and Scully fighting and solving new problems. We can expect a twist, new monsters, and apparently an old character - who was thought to be dead - is alive and well. This new series from Fox will have a two-night premiere, debuting on 24 January, with the following episode airing the next night.<end_of_turn>

# No Injuries In School Bus Accident

A Lincoln school bus driver and children on the bus did exactly what they were supposed to do following an accident last week in Evansville, according to Jill Jackson, principal of Lincoln Elementary School. Jackson said the bus driver radioed that she had been involved in an accident. Evansville does not have cell service. Jackson said she notified 911 and then called to request that the school send another school bus out to the incident. "The bus driver did great and the children did great," Jackson said. "We train for bus evacuations and now they know why." No one was injured in the accident, but Jackson said her elementary children were very happy when she showed up. According to an Arkansas State Police report, the Lincoln bus was traveling south on U.S. Highway 59 inside the Evansville city limits about 4 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 5. The bus had stopped to unload children at a regularly scheduled bus stop when a small Nissan pickup stopped on the northbound side, as required by law. A Chevrolet Suburban SUV pulling a small trailer was traveling behind the pickup. The SUV driver attempted to avoid hitting the pickup by traveling into the west ditch, causing the driver to lose control of his vehicle. The SUV then swerved back into the northbound lane, striking the Nissan truck and subsequently pushing it into the side of the school bus. Jackson said the school bus was carrying 19 children and when the second bus arrived, all children were transferred to the second bus. They waited there until the State Police released them. In the meantime, Jackson said, school officials had contacted parents and many parents arrived to take their children home. Afterward, the six remaining children were taken home by the school bus. Everyone was home by 5 p.m., Jackson said. General News on 01/16/2019 Print Headline: No Injuries In School Bus Accident<end_of_turn>

# Man Utd news: Solskjaer plans to use one key factor to beat Pochettino and Zidane to job

The 45-year-old has overseen six wins on the bounce ever since replacing Jose Mourinho as manager back in December. As a result, Manchester United fans are pitching Solskjaer’s name to take the job on a permanent basis. He is currently spending the remainder of the season at Old Trafford, with a return to FC Molde planned in the summer. But, while United continue to perform, Solskjaer will be tipped to take over. And the Evening Standard claim he hopes to use style as a means of convincing the board to give it to him. For the first time since United icon Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, the Red Devils have a manager capable of implementing an enthralling style. David Moyes’ 10-month tenure was drab to watch. And so too were the days of Louis van Gaal, with the Dutchman’s system tedious. It was a similar story with Mourinho who, despite landing trophies in the form of the EFL Cup and Europa League during his time in charge, failed to get Old Trafford on its feet. Solskjaer, however, has been able to do just that. United have netted 17 times in his first six games in charge, with Sunday’s 1-0 victory over Tottenham most impressive. And the Evening Standard say that, by giving United an exciting stage to perform on, Solskjaer is hopeful he can land the role - regardless of whether they finish in the top four or win a trophy. For now, Mauricio Pochettino is their No 1 choice to take over. The Tottenham boss has won plaudits for all his work during his five years in north London. Under also consideration is Zidane. The Frenchman is currently out of work after choosing to quit Real Madrid last year, just days after steering them to a third Champions League triumph in a row. Allegri is an outsider for the job. Yet the Juventus boss could jump ship if they win the Champions League which, given he has Cristiano Ronaldo at his disposal, is not to be ruled out.<end_of_turn>

# Amazon bundles an Alexa Voice Remote with its latest Fire TV Stick | TheINQUIRER

AMAZON IS upping the ante on the set-top-box wars with a major upgrade to its Fire TV Stick offering.  The company has announced that Fire TV Stick will now come bundled with an Alexa Voice Remote, previously available separately for an extra £29.99 (historically even more) bundled alongside.  This means that as well as being able to control the power and volume on your telly from the Fire Voice Remote, you'll also be able to search and voice control your viewing.  Most important of all, this will make Fire TV Stick one of the cheapest ways to bring Alexa into the home, with the remote's mic adding a gateway to the voice assistant.  It also adds a range of Alexa's video capabilities, such as live streams from cameras and home control.  Existing customers need not despair as Amazon is also offering 50 per cent off the Voice Remote at just £14.99. It's not just compatible with the stick either, as it'll also work with the following devices: Fire TV Stick (2nd Gen), Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV (3rd Gen, Pendant Design)  Fire TV has proved to be one of the biggest weapons in Amazon's hardware lineup, despite many of the most innovative implementations not reaching the UK, with sales hardly dented at all by a stint with Jeremy Clarkson as a spokesperson.  Amazon is involved in an ongoing spat with Google over access to the YouTube app, however, it's easy to work around by simply accessing the website from your device instead.  The Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote is £39.99. The 4K (UHD) version is £49.99, with a Voice Remote or a standalone mic remote setting you back an additional £14.99 until 28 January. Shipping of the new bundled devices commences on 23 January, and pre-orders are open now. μ  The app now meets the DoD's compliance standards, apparently  For folks who like their tweets in real-time  43 Days. Thousands of responses. Huge potential for improvements  It also risks a fine of, er, £8,100<end_of_turn>

# PTO….Perry…Pups | News-Talk 1480 WHBC

Love the halfway point of any High School Basketball Season. Teams that are looking to stay in the hunt in their respective leagues. Maybe looking to improve upon team cohesiveness and chemistry. Maybe looking to test their ability to improve on consistency, and at the same time test their ability to respond to adversity. Then again….there are also teams who are just struggling to get better. Pretty good summary of our broadcast this Friday Night in the PTO as the Panthers will host the Pups in a tough Federal League Match –Up.  Perry stop a two game losing skid by looking adversity in the eyes and soundly defeating CCHS by 23. The Panthers were solid unit cohesive….for the most part consistent….and the chemistry was in full display. More assists than turnovers, good shot selection, sharing the bball, and stingy defense. Nice way to get back in the win column. Coach Spurgeon has them all in with his philosophy.  The Bulldogs continue to be challenged with consistency and find themselves staring at adversity literally every week. The Pups haven’t put together back to back wins since the opening two games of the season. An impressive win over Iggy was followed by 3 consecutive losses. Then a dominant win over Hoover was followed by back to back losses to Lake and Glenoak….both at home. However, McKinley is young and you will never question their effort. Coach V is working his tail off, and his players are doing the same. There are good things to come. Friday Night will tell us more.  The temps will be dropping on Friday Night in the PTO, but Panther Gymnasium will be cookin’! From my perspective in the booth…..prepare for a rocking rematch with the Panthers and the Pups. Would you expect anything less? The Heritage Continues On the Hardwood Friday night at 7:30 LIVE on 1480 WHBC and Streaming LIVE on whbcsports.com and whbc.com. Denny Kinkead and I look forward to bringing you all of the action on The One..The Only….1480 WHBC!! See y’all On the Radio!!<end_of_turn>

# Two tiny beetle fossils offer evolution and biogeography clues

It is well-known that living fossils exhibit stasis over geologically long time scales. Examples are the panda and ginkgo. Now, two tiny beetles trapped in 99-million-year-old amber may join this group.  Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals on our planet. Among four extant suborders of beetles, polyphaga is the largest and most diverse group. The origin and early evolutionary history of polyphagan beetles have been largely based on evidence from the derived and diverse 'core polyphaga', whereas little is known about the species-poor basal polyphagan lineages, which include Clambidae and four other extant families.  Recently, an international team led by Dr. CAI Chenyang, from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported two new and rare species of the extant family Clambidae from Burmese amber: Acalyptomerus thayerae Cai and Lawrence, 2019, and Sphaerothorax uenoi Cai and Lawrence, 2019. They are important for understanding the early evolution and biogeography of the family and even for polyphagan beetles.  Clambidae is a small group of small-sized (usually 0.7-2.0 mm long) polyphagan beetles distributed worldwide, with approximately 150 described species grouped in five extant genera. Most clambid adults occur in decaying vegetation, leaf litter and rotten wood and occasionally fly at dusk.  The two new species, represented by five well-preserved fossils, were discovered by Dr. CAI and colleagues from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. Both species are extremely morphologically close to their living counterparts, and can be placed in extant genera. Acalyptomerus thayerae (about 1.05-1.15 mm long) has a close affinity to A. herbertfranzi, a species currently occurring in Mesoamerica and northern South America. Sphaerothorax uenoi (about 0.71 mm long) is closely related to extant species of Sphaerothorax, which are usually collected in forests of Nothofagus in Australia, Chile and New Zealand.  The discovery of two Cretaceous species from northern Myanmar indicates that both genera had lengthy evolutionary histories, originating at least by the earliest Cenomanian, and were probably more widespread than at present.  Remarkable morphological similarities between fossil and living species suggest that both genera changed little over long periods of geological time, which is usually considered to be a feature of living fossils. The long-term persistence of similar mesic microhabitats such as leaf litter may account for the 99-million-year morphological stasis in Acalyptomerus and Sphaerothorax.  ###<end_of_turn>

# McKinley Mall's value has been slashed by 75 percent

Things are getting worse at McKinley Mall.  The mall fell delinquent on a $25.8 million loan payment over the summer. Now, it has been put into receivership by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge and had its value cut by 75 percent.  Next, its tax-assessed value could be slashed, which would leave government and school officials in Hamburg scrambling for budget cuts and tax increases.  Worth an estimated $56.6 million in 2013, the mall’s value has been dropped to $15 million, according to the mall’s major loan servicer, Wells Fargo. That means the mall is worth less than half of the $35.1 million loan for which the mall is being used as collateral. That loan comes due in 2023.  Like many other mid-range enclosed shopping centers across the country, McKinley Mall has become less valuable after losing major anchor tenants, attracting fewer shoppers and generating less revenue.  Built in 1986 and renovated in 2008, McKinley Mall’s decline has been swift.  It lost a Macy’s anchor store and a Macy’s Home store in 2016, which were bought by Benderson Development but remain empty. Ulta, which occupied high-profile space facing McKinley Parkway, left the mall last year in favor of Quaker Crossing in Orchard Park.  Bon-Ton took up 13.4 percent of the space accounted for in the loan, but it’s been vacant since the department store chain went out of business in August. A string of smaller stores have also gone dark.  Sears is the mall’s largest remaining tenant, occupying 20 percent of the shopping center.  That the bankrupt department store takes up so much space is a troubling prospect. The company has closed all but its McKinley store in the Western New York market, and it could go out of business if a bid by Sears’ chairman’s investment company fails at a bankruptcy auction on Monday. The other bidders are liquidation companies that would sell off the company’s remaining inventory and properties and shutter the chain.  McKinley’s other major tenants include the struggling J.C. Penney department store chain, taking up almost 15 percent of the mall’s space, Best Buy with 4.6 percent and Barnes & Noble with 4 percent, according to real estate advisory firm Trepp.  The Woodmont Co., McKinley's receiver, said it is "taking all action necessary to preserve and protect the asset.  "Among the operating priorities is increasing the occupancy of the property, which is critical in light of the closing of The Bon-Ton and ULTA prior to the commencement of the receivership," said Fred Meno, Woodmont president and CEO.  Stoltz wants its tax assessment to reflect the mall's lower value, but is asking for a drastic devaluation. It has filed a petition with the State Supreme Court to lower its assessment, currently $24.3 million, to just $2.8 million.  That worries Town of Hamburg Supervisor James Shaw, who said the mall’s lowered tax bill would leave Hamburg taxpayers shouldering an unfair share, and put its schools and villages in the lurch.  The mall is Hamburg’s largest source of tax revenue. The town, Frontier School District and Erie County all are fighting against the assessment reduction.  If the assessment is cut, Shaw said the town could sell some of its real estate, including a former railroad terminal and library building. It is also considering ending its lease of Woodlawn Beach, it said.  Woodmont Co. has taken over the assessment appeal since taking receivership. Stoltz could not be reached to comment.<end_of_turn>

# Guinness Pro14: South African teams braced for derby

It’s derby time in South Africa and on Friday all Guinness PRO14 roads will lead to Port Elizabeth where the Southern Kings and Cheetahs will take centre stage in their first encounter of the season, which is also the only match of the weekend.  The clash will be significant for both teams, as the Cheetahs will look to maintain their unbeaten run against their South African counterparts after winning all three previous matches between them in the competition, while the Southern Kings will be desperate to register their second victory of the season.  The Free Staters are fresh off a morale-boosting 27-12 victory against Zebre Rugby Club in Italy – their third victory in five outings – and this is expected to boost their confidence going into the clash.  The home side, in turn, will have their sights set on bouncing back from their disappointing 38-0 defeat against Edinburgh in Scotland, especially after an encouraging spell in their four previous encounters in which they suffered three defeats by seven points or less.  The Cheetahs have been superior on attack and defence this season, with the Bloemfontein outfit having scored 36 tries and conceded 44, while the Southern Kings have scored 28 and let in 52.  These statistics, however, could have little significance, especially with the hosts mindful of the fact that they went down by only nine points the last times the sides crossed paths in the competition in April in Port Elizabeth.  Their match-day teams have yet to be announced, but the Southern Kings will be particularly wary of Cheetahs’ try-scoring machine, Rabz Maxwane, who is the top try-scorer in the competition with eight tries, but they will also keep a close eye on the hosts’ Yaw Penxe, who is also on the top try-scorers list with five tries.  There was good news on the injury front this week for the Isuzu Southern Kings as Masixole Banda (leg) and Tertius Kruger (hand) were declared fit after suffering injuries in their last match, while Sibusiso Sithole has recovered from a long-term knee injury, and will be available for selection.  Guinness PRO 14 Round 14 fixture:  Isuzu Southern Kings v Toyota Cheetahs  Date: Friday, 18 January  SA time: 19h00  Venue: Madibaz Stadium, Port Elizabeth  Referee: Quinton Immelman  Assistant referees: Cwengile Jadezweni and Paul Mente  TMO: Shaun Veldsman  TV: SS1<end_of_turn>

# Saudi teen granted asylum in Canada now onto rollie ciggies – after denouncing Islam

Rahaf Mohammed caused a global sensation when she barricaded herself in an airport hotel room in Bangkok and begged not be deported back to Saudi Arabia. She has renounced Islam and her last name al-Qunun after claiming her family abused her and had made threats to kill her, which they denied. After being resettled in Canada by the UN refugee agency, she has been enjoying previously forbidden pleasures such as bacon. The social media-savvy teen has now shared snaps of red wine and a lit cigarette as she continues to enjoy her new home — despite the chilly temperature. “I know there are unlucky women who disappeared after trying to escape or who could not do anything to change their reality” Rahaf Mohammed She captioned the image of the roll-up in Arabic - translating to “evaporate and evaporate”. She also shared a picture of the glass of red wine she indulged in on the flight to Toronto over the weekend. On Tuesday, Rahaf shared a picture on Snapchat of Canadian-style bacon and eggs with the caption “Omg bacon”, heart emojis, and the Canadian flag. The teen also revealed her bare legs in a knee-length dress, which was forbidden in her ultra-conservative home country. Meanwhile, the refugee agency helping her revealed it has hired a security guard 24/7 due to threats to her safety. Mario Calla, the executive director of Costi Immigrant Services, which has been contracted by the Canadian government to help Ms Mohammed, said the embattled teenager received multiple threats online on Tuesday. “She sees these threats. She has left Islam and she basically has broken away from her family, and that scares her,” he added. In a press conference on Tuesday, Rahaf thanked the Canadian and Thai governments as well as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in a statement read on her behalf by a settlement worker. “I am one of the lucky ones,” she said. “I know there are unlucky women who disappeared after trying to escape or who could not do anything to change their reality.” She added her mission now was to learn english and help other women fleeing violence. “Today and for years to come, I will work in support of freedom for women around the world,” she said. “The same freedom I experienced on the first day I arrived in Canada.” Rahaf also said she wants to make her own decisions on education, on a career and who she will marry, whereas before she would have needed permission from a male guardian. “I had no say in any of this. Today I can proudly say that I am capable of making all those decisions,” she said.<end_of_turn>

# Dunwoody neighborhood activist Bob Lundsten dies at 65

Robert “Bob” Gordon Lundsten, a former president of the Dunwoody Homeowners Association, neighborhood activist and avid gardener, died on Jan. 16, 2019. He was 65.  A memorial service is set for Jan. 24 at 10 a.m. at All Saints Catholic Church, 2443 Mount Vernon Road. A reception will follow at noon at the Dunwoody Country Club, 1600 Dunwoody Club Drive.  City Councilmember Terry Nall, who noted Lundsten was also known as “Farmer Bob” and at one time wrote a blog under that name, praised Lundsten’s work on behalf of the residents of Dunwoody, especially his work in helping raise some $70,000 to buy AEDs for every city police car after the city was incorporated a decade ago.  “As soon as [the] Dunwoody Police Department was formed, Bob initiated a community fundraising effort to equip every Dunwoody Police vehicle with an AED unit for heart attack calls, as Dunwoody Police was more likely to be first on the scene,” Nall said in a written statement. “Over the last 10 years, many ‘saves’ from these AED units have been reported.”  Lundsten’s parents worked for the Salvation Army, Nall said, and he recalled him sharing fond memories of his childhood.  “I’m confident Bob heard kettle bells ringing when he was called home,” Nall said. “Our prayers are with Bob’s entire family for God’s comfort. Dunwoody is a better place because he came by our way. He will be missed, but not forgotten.”  Lundsten served on the DeKalb County Planning Commission before Dunwoody was incorporated and then served on the Dunwoody Planning Commission. He served as DHA president in 1985 and 1987. In 2009, he received the DHA’s Community Service Award.  In 2010, Lundsten was appointed chief of staff to DeKalb County Commissioner Elaine Boyer, who represented north DeKalb for more than 20 years. Boyer pleaded guilty in 2014 to using her county credit card to pay for personal items and defrauding taxpayers. She served a year in federal prison.  In 2016, Lundsten was reprimanded by the DeKalb Ethics Board for using his county credit card for personal expenses.  A sometimes-outspoken critic of city officials, Lundsten in recent years took on Mayor Denis Shortal and the City Council after they attempted to formally ban DHA members from serving on both the DHA executive board and on a city board, such as the Zoning Board of Appeals and Planning Commission. He also voiced strong opposition to the city’s recent move to loosen architectural restrictions in the Dunwoody Village Overlay district, an overlay he helped create as a member of the DHA.  For many years, Lundsten ran the popular “Dunwoody Farmer Bob” blog where he wrote about gardening and local politics.<end_of_turn>

Plans for 5,000 posh apartments to replace Harlech Tower should be scrapped, according to the actor, who played Del Boy Trotter. There is already a petition to save the flats – urging Historic England to give it listed protection before they are transformed into a development worth £1bn. Sir David, 78, said: 'Of course I think it should be a listed building but they aren't going to listen. 'It was a proper block of flats and it was of it's time, which was fine and is probably why we used it. so that is why we used it. It was great. 'Del Boy would say, 'Next time this year Rodney we will be billionaires.' And he'd be right. They are now aren't they now?'

# Martensville man charged with three child pornography offences

A 32-year-old Martensville man has been charged with three child pornography offences after an investigation by the Saskatchewan Internet Child Exploitation Unit.  A 32-year-old Martensville man has been charged with three child pornography offences after an investigation by the Saskatchewan Internet Child Exploitation (ICE) Unit. The charges stem from a November 2018 complaint regarding the uploading of child pornography to a “popular social media site,” said an RCMP news release. On Jan. 17, 2018, members of the ICE Unit and Martensville RCMP executed a search warrant at a residence in Martensville where numerous devices and child pornography were seized. The 32-year-old was arrested at the scene and charged with two counts of possession of child pornography and one count of making child pornography available. Police say he was on day parole in relation to previous child pornography offences, which has since been revoked. He is scheduled to appear in Saskatoon Provincial Court on Friday morning.<end_of_turn>

# Albertville cop killer asking for his sentence to add the possibility of parole

James Hyde was 17-years old when he killed an Albertville police detective.  A judge sentenced him to die, but years later the Supreme Court ended mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles. Friday, Hyde got a new day in court. During his testimony he said he wishes he could take back his actions from 1995.  "I don't deserve to ask for this court's mercy," said Hyde.  "He should serve life without parole, because Andy's not here, his life is gone," said James Maze.  In 1995, James Hyde killed Albertville police detective Andrew Whitten when a friend feared the detective would testify against him in court.  More than two decades later, detective Whitten's partner, James Maze, still remembers his friend Andy.  "He was always laughing, he always had a smile on his face, he was always cutting up," remembered Maze.  Albertville Police filled the courtroom during the hearing. We learned at the time of the murder, Hyde was about a month away from turning 18.  "If he had waited 30 something days or whatever it was we wouldn't be here," said Maze.  During his time in prison, Hyde accumulated more than 20 write ups ranging from walking on the wrong side of the hallway to assault. He testified he now goes to church on occasion and graduated from anger management.  Maze says he feels like its his responsibility to make sure Hyde stays in prison because Whitten was more than a colleague.  "He's my friend," said Maze.  The judge will make his decision one month from today. Even if Hyde is granted parole, it will be 30-years before he's eligible.

# New study links exposure to household chemical with heart disease and cancer | Malay Mail

NEW YORK, Jan 18 ― New US research has found a link between dichlorophenols (DCPs), chemicals commonly found in a variety of common everyday products, and a higher risk of cancer and heart disease.  Carried out by researchers at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, the new study looked at 3,617 participants who had taken part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a programme of the National Centre for Health Statistics at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.  The participants self-reported their history of illness and provided urine samples for analysis so the researchers could estimate their exposure to two types of DCPs, 2,5-DCP and 2,4-DCP.  DCPs can be found in a variety of industrial and common consumer products such as deodorisers, antibacterial additives, such as triclosan, a common ingredient in toothpaste, and even chlorinated drinking water.  The findings, published in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine, showed that higher urinary 2,5-DCP concentrations were associated with greater prevalence of heart disease and greater prevalence of all cancers combined, however no association was found between 2,4-DCP and heart disease or cancer.  In addition, no statistically significant associations were found between 2,4-DCP or 2,5-DCP and lung diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, thyroid problems or liver conditions.  Previous NHANES research, which showed that 81 percent of people tested positive for the presence of 2,4-DCP and 2,5-DCP in urine tests, also supports the new findings.  “Given that 81 per cent of Americans show evidence of exposure to these chemicals, we need to understand more about how they may influence health,” said lead author Mary Rooney.  She now recommends further research into the effects of DCP exposure. ― AFP-Relaxnews<end_of_turn>

# Bill Lee follows in Republican footsteps for criminal justice reform in Tennessee | Opinion

Tennessee's governor-elect Bill Lee discussed his goals for the state, including the idea of altering the corrections system. Autumn Allison, Nashville Tennessean Other conservative states like Texas and Georgia have already taken on criminal justice reform and Republicans are embracing the issue more readily. The refrain is echoed across the country. “Rather than simply be tough on crime, we need to be smart on crime.” In this instance, Nate McConnell, a Montana legislator, said it to a reporter in 2017 after the Republican-controlled state legislature there approved a sweeping overhaul of Montana’s criminal justice system. McConnell is a Democrat, but if his words sound familiar, it is because Tennessee’s 50th governor, Republican Bill Lee, has said the same thing, almost word for word. Not only that, but Republicans across the country, in state legislatures and in Congress, now seem to be all for reforming the justice system. Criminal justice reform has weighed heavy in Tennessee in the last several weeks. Matthew Charles, a Nashville man who was banished back to federal prison after what amounted to a prosecutorial mistake, was set free by provisions in the federal First Step Act, which received considerable Republican support and was signed by President Donald Trump. On the state level, outgoing Republican Gov. Bill Haslam granted clemency to Cyntoia Brown, whose case had been taken up by many criminal-justice reform activists. This turnaround may seem abrupt, but it is some years in the making. Texas, perhaps the most law and order of states, took up the issue as far back as 2007. Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia, a Republican and former judge, pushed successfully for reforms in that state after taking office in 2011. Republicans are still 'law and order,' but they worry about system's costs These are only a few of the conservative-leaning states in recent years to turn away from a “lock ‘em up” approach in favor of sentencing reforms to concentrate on jailing violent criminals while rehabbing nonviolent ones. “I believe there is a gradual change occurring in the Republican Party on this issue,” said Alberto Gonzales, a former U.S. attorney general under George W. Bush and currently the dean of the Belmont law school. “Republicans I know still believe in law and order and holding people to account for their actions, but we also are very worried about the rising costs of our current system. It is not sustainable.” In short, housing prisoners for decades for offenses that we now know better could be handled by rehabilitation is expensive. Texas has closed eight prisons and shed up to 30,000 prisoners since 2007. More changes may be in store this year. There is, however, a more cynical theory, as Vanderbilt political science students noted when professor Carrie Archie Russell brought up the subject. “They responded first that it’s just about money and the appearances of being fiscally conservative that is attractive to most conservative voters, but that this is also a bipartisan issue that is popular with lots of constituencies,” Russell said. “And of course the Koch brothers have been pushing this agenda for years, so many politicians are happy to accept their contributions in exchange for being advocates of criminal justice reform.” They grow up awfully jaded these days, apparently. But Russell’s students did hit on something that could be true to a degree. “But then they blew me away suggesting that it’s a political ploy to attract younger voters who presumably are all comfortable with nonviolent minor drug use, pot specifically, and minority voters because the GOP is bleeding voters,” Russell said. The growing trend indicates a rising libertarian trend among the GOP Whatever the motivation, there is a definite libertarian streak among younger conservatives, embodied prominently in U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, recalling the presidential runs of former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who was popular among the young. To be sure, criminal justice reform is still greeted skeptically by a sizable number of conservatives. But it does seem clear that a new day, or a different day, is dawning, and yes, Bill Lee seems onboard. "I want to work with leaders for sentencing reform, judicial reform, intake reform, re-entry reform," Lee said in a December speech. He hasn’t been willing prior to inauguration to get much more detailed than that, but it is clear that Lee is genuinely concerned about recidivism and a never-ending cycle of incarceration. It is an effective way to get a new administration off on the right foot.<end_of_turn>

# Momentum swings in Hobart's favour as Scorchers fall in final over

In a match of swinging momentum, the Perth Scorchers have been defeated by the number one team in the Big Bash League, the Hobart Hurricanes, going down in the last over of the night. The Hurricanes won the toss and elected to bowl, the Scorchers sending Michael Klinger and Cameron Bancroft to face opening bowler James Faulkner. The partnership was short-lived however, as both Klinger and Bancroft were out for a duck within the first over. Klinger could consider himself unlucky after having an LBW decision go against him, with the replay showing the ball going down leg side. The decision was particularly painful for Klinger, who only five days ago was controversially out thanks to another umpiring blunder, losing his wicket on the seventh ball of an over. If Scorchers fans didn’t consider themselves in a world of trouble after the first over, things would have changed when Skipper Ashton Turner chopped on the thirteenth ball of the innings, leaving the home side 3/7. With a mountain of work ahead of them, Sam Whiteman and Hilton Cartwright put together an important partnership, accumulating 77 runs off the next 54 balls which included eight boundaries, before Cartwright was caught behind in the 12th over. Whiteman swiftly brought up his half century, but later was caught out in an over of carnage from David Moody that saw three batsmen go. Some explosive batting from AJ Tye and Nathan Coulter-Nile in the last five overs saw out the innings with the Scorchers setting a target of 178. The Scorchers meant business from the very start of the second innings, taking the wickets of the dangerous Matthew Wade and the League’s top scorer D’Arcy Short within the power play. The Hurricanes kept within reach of the required run rate however, with an impressive effort from debutant Caleb Jewell adding 32 runs from 20 balls before being caught at deep square leg from an AJ Tye ball. Some impressive batting from George Bailey and Ben McDermott saw the Hurricanes at 3/92 after 11 overs, 10 runs ahead of what the Scorchers made at the same point in their innings. A stumping from Cameron Bancroft off an Usman Qadjr ball saw the partnership of 37 off 27 broken in the 12th over. Gierge Bailey worked in tandem with Simon Milenko and James Faulkner to bring up the tenth BBL half-century of his career. The game was in the balance with five overs remaining, with the Hurricanes in need of 50 runs. George Bailey made the win look possible, making runs all around the ground easily, before falling to AJ Tye in the 18th over for 69 runs. Johan Botha joined James Faulkner at the crease, and after hitting a four off the last ball of AJ Tye’s over, 21 required off the last two overs looked a doable effort. However, a restrictive fast bowling over from Nathan Coulter-Nile gave only five runs up, meaning the Hurricanes needed 16 off the last over from AJ Tye. James Faulkner made light work of it in the end, clearing the rope three balls in a row to bring about the win. THE STUDS Sam Whiteman played one of the best innings of his T20 career tonight. Coming in at 1/0 and seeing Michael Klinger and Ashton Turner go at the other end, Whiteman found himself between a rock and a hard place. Not only did he help dig his team out of the hole early, but stayed at the crease long enough to help put the Scorchers in a winning position. His 68 from 44 included nine boundaries, the most of any batsman along with Bailey. George Bailey was easily the best player for the Hurricanes, making important runs when his team was in need. Coming to the crease at 3/55 and without superstar batsmen Matthew Wade and D’Arcy Short, Bailey stood up when in need to make 69 off only 40 balls and built important partnerships with Ben McDermott and James Faulkner, making it an all-round superb batting performance. He rightly earned himself player of the match for the effort. THE DUDS Cameron Bancroft and Michael Klinger share the unwanted honours of being worst for the Scorchers. Coming in as opening batsmen in the first innings against the best team in the League, there is no worse result than being sent back to the bench with no runs. Klinger can consider himself very unlucky for the call going against him, while Bancroft redeemed some of his poor batting with a good stumping to remove Ben McDermott. International recruit Jofra Archer had a night to forget. Coming in after the damage done by Faulkner, Archer had the freedom to bowl aggressively in an effort to take more wickets. He was unable to rise to the occasion however, and gave away 15 runs in his first over, before being removed from the bowling attack for three head-high balls the umpires considered too dangerous. THE ONE TO REMEMBER For the Scorchers, the last over of the first innings was perhaps the biggest highlights of the match. Losing two wickets the previous over and sitting at 9/156, no one would have blamed Usman Qadir and Nathan Coulter-Nile for preserving their wickets and adding a few runs to see out the over. Taking a relaxed approach to batting isn’t in Coulter-Nile’s genes however, as he proceeded to send three balls over James Faulkner’s head and the rope, adding on 21 runs to the total. The biggest highlight for Hurricanes fans tonight was the opening over. Winning the toss and choosing to bowl, Matthew Wade had faith in the James Faulkner’s ability to swing the new ball. His faith was immediately paid off when Faulkner took the wickets of openers Cameron Bancroft and Michael Klinger without the pair making any runs. THE ONE TO FORGET After a night of ups and downs, Scorchers fans were on the edge of their seats, hopeful of a win with only an over remaining. However, the three consecutive boundaries off AJ Tye’s bowling immediately sucked the energy out of the stadium in the lowest of the lowlights in tonight’s match. Giving up 16 runs in an over is bad for any bowler, but to give them up with the game on the line is particularly painful for a bowler that is usually one of the best at closing out games in the League. For the Hurricanes, the biggest lowlight was the biggest highlight for the Scorchers. The last over of the Scorchers innings had the home crowd on their, but would have had the Hurricanes fans at home disappointed. Luckily enough, James Faulkner, the bowler of the last over, repaid the poor over with the bat, brining home the win with three huge boundaries. WHAT NOW? The Scorchers remain seventh on the BBL ladder, and will next face the third-placed Sydney Thunder at Perth Stadium on Thursday, January 24.<end_of_turn>

# ArtsCenter needs a new home. Why it won’t be a future county library site in Carrboro.

The ArtsCenter is going to move, but it won’t be moving into a $25 million library and civic building planned for an existing downtown parking lot. The timing of the 203 S. Greensboro St. project just isn’t going to work out, executive director Daniel Mayer said. A possible new site for the ArtsCenter could be announced in a few months, he said.  “Our schedule and their schedule — just how the project was unfolding — it wasn’t working out,” Mayer said. “They have a lot of issues to resolve regarding parking and different aspects of the project. I’m trying to take the ArtsCenter through a faster process.”  The decision comes roughly nine months after the Carrboro Board of Aldermen approved a development agreement with the arts and entertainment nonprofit for part of the 65,000-square-foot building on roughly an acre of town-owned land.

There have been many conversations about how to make the deal work, she said.  “We always knew that this was a point at which, especially the ArtsCenter was really going to have to take a hard look at it and decide whether they want to move forward,” Lavelle said.  “I think we’re all disappointed it’s not going to work out in the fashion we had hoped over the last several months, but the ArtsCenter is still a much beloved member of our community,” she said. “We look forward to having them stay in Carrboro and hopefully program in Carrboro as they kind of regroup and figure out what plans they have for the future.”  Besides a southern branch of the Orange County Public Library — replacing the Cybrary and McDougle library branches in Carrboro — the new building could house Carrboro town offices, a Teen Center, Virtual Justice Center and the community radio station WCOM.  Lavelle said she is confident the new parking will be in place by the time construction is underway on the new building. The town and county are looking at multiple solutions, she said.  The ArtsCenter decision will force the town and county to reallocate the cost of designing and constructing the building. The town has agreed to pay half the cost of preparing the site and building common elements, such as elevators and roofs, plus the cost to finish and furnish the town’s spaces.  The county has budgeted $7.6 million toward the project’s design and construction.  The negotiations and planning have delayed construction, Lavelle said, but the governments will be able to move forward with more certainty now that they are the only partners. Construction could begin by late 2020, or maybe sooner, she said.  Meanwhile, the ArtsCenter is working on “an exit strategy” from the former Piggly Wiggly store it has occupied for over 40 years, Mayer said. Main Street Partners LLC, owner of the East Main Square development at 300 E. Main St., plans to redevelop the strip mall that is home to the ArtsCenter, Cat’s Cradle, Vencino Brewing Co. and Amante Gourmet Pizza.  Main Street Partners made a $700,000 loan to the ArtsCenter in November, setting up the sale of the center’s building to the developer by Dec. 31, 2023, according to Orange County property records.  Officials with Main Street Partners LLC did not return calls asking about the status of the 300 East Main redevelopment project. Mayer said it’s been over 30 years since the ArtsCenter building was remodeled.  “This building is really old and really in terrible shape,” he said. “During the recent snowstorm, we had a lot of flooding. The walls were dripping, floors were warping. It’s a 1960s Piggly Wiggly, and it’s about time we move out.”  The best space would allow them to grow and serve more than their 90,000-plus annual visitors, he said. The ceramic studio classes are always sold out, and the programs and children’s camps don’t have room to grow, he noted.  The ArtsCenter’s previous attempt to find a new home — the Arts and Innovation Center proposed for a 200 E. Main St. parking lot — was rejected by the town in 2015. That plan, a partnership with the Kidzu Children’s Museum, was for a four-story, 55,000-square-foot building.  Mayer said they still are talking with Kidzu and other community partners. The museum has approached the town of Chapel Hill about building its new home on town land near Southern Village. Kidzu now leases space in the University Place mall.  Lavelle said the best solution would keep the ArtsCenter in Carrboro.  “One point we’ve made with them all along is the ArtsCenter is a treasured organization in our community, and we really would like them to stay in Carrboro if at all possible. I think they feel that way as well,” she said. “I think part of the reason our restaurants and our downtown shops do pretty well is the traffic from the ArtsCenter and the traffic from the [Cat’s] Cradle.”<end_of_turn>

# Sacramento Kings vs. Detroit Pistons Live Score and Stats - January 19, 2019 Gametracker

Center Andre Drummond, the league's leading rebounder, and reserve point guard Ish Smith departed in the first half of a 98-93 victory over Miami on Friday. Drummond suffered a nasal contusion when he was elbowed by the Heat's James Johnson.  Smith played briefly before heading to the locker room with groin tightness. It was just his third game since missing more than a month with an adductor tear.  Coach Dwane Casey is "hopeful" Drummond will play while listing Smith as "day-to-day."  The Pistons (20-24) led by as much as 16 in the first half, fell behind after getting outscored 30-12 in the third quarter, then rallied back in the final quarter.  "It's one of our habits we've got to break," Casey said. "As soon as they make a run, we drop our heads, drop our shoulders, our energy level goes down. Winning teams, championship teams, don't do that. You can't."  Power forward Blake Griffin had another monster game, racking up 32 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. The Pistons also received a big contribution from second-year guard Luke Kennard, who scored 22 points off the bench.  "Luke is showing he's going to be a dynamic wing player," Casey said. "He hit some big shots."  If Drummond can't play, the Pistons will rely on Zaza Pachulia and perhaps Jon Leuer to fill the void. Leuer was inactive on Friday. Smith's absence would thrust 37-year-old Jose Calderon into the backup role behind Reggie Jackson.  The Kings (23-22) began a six-game road swing with a 114-95 loss at Charlotte on Thursday. Sacramento trailed throughout the second half after giving up 43 points in the second quarter.  "We've got to have a short memory and move on," center Marvin Bagley told the Sacramento Bee. "We've got another one in a couple days and we've just got to bounce back."  Shooting guard Buddy Hield made six 3-pointers en route to 24 points and is averaging 4.3 long-range makes this month. He was unimpressed by his individual contribution.  "It means nothing," Hield told the Bee. "We still lost. Winning basketball games is more important. We have to get the next one."  The Kings had an early 13-point lead, and coach Dave Joerger believes his team got complacent. Sacramento defeated Charlotte at home five nights earlier.  "I think we got lulled to sleep a little bit by making some shots early and the rest of the game they just lined it up and went straight at us," he said. "Hats off to them. They were not going to be denied the second time playing each other in a short amount of time."  The Kings won the first meeting with the Pistons 112-102 on Jan. 10 behind a balanced attack. They had seven double-figure scorers that night, led by Hield with 18 points.  The victory came with an asterisk as Casey rested Griffin that evening. Drummond and Leuer were the only available big men that night, forcing Detroit to use four-guard lineups at times. Sacramento had a 57-40 rebounding advantage.  --Field Level Media  Copyright 2019 by STATS.

# Kent Kwik raises salary for Conveinence Store Managers in Midland-Odessa

MIDLAND-ODESSA, TX (KWES) - In an effort to keep up with the oil and gas industry, Kent Kwik announced they are raising the base salaries of their convenience store managers to $65,000 in Midland and Odessa. The stores are also offering the potential to earn over $100,000 after bonuses.  In addition, the company is offering a $6,000 signing bonus for managers and a $3,000 bonus for entry-level team members, paid out over 90 days.  Director of Corporate Communications Meredith Bright explained why the company cared so much about making this change.  “Our store managers work extremely hard for us and we wanted to do everything in our power to just try and help make their lives a little bit easier and a little bit less stressful,” said Bright. “Taking the money side of it off the plate helps them focus on their family, and their life, and really just building their career within our company.”  The company emphasizes that everyone involved in their mission is a team member and a part of the family, so it was great to support those who help Kent Kwik every day.  “They were just ecstatic, but most importantly, they were just super excited their hard work was recognized and we were thrilled we were able to do that for them.”<end_of_turn>

# Nigel Farage to lead new pro-Brexit party if EU departure delayed

Nigel Farage is being lined up as leader of a new pro-Brexit party if Britain’s departure from the European Union is delayed beyond 29 March.  The former Ukip leader said he had offered his enthusiastic support to the Brexit party after being sounded out as its potential leader.  Catherine Blaiklock, Ukip’s former economics spokeswoman, confirmed she had applied to register the party with the Electoral Commission on 11 January and that it would be ready to fight any snap general election or the local elections across England in May.  She told the Guardian on Sunday: “I think people feel treason has been committed. It’s democracy. It wouldn’t matter whether leave had won by a single vote – it’s a first-past-the-post system.”  Blaiklock said the party was aiming to attract the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU in June 2016 and to win over defectors from the Conservatives, Labour and Ukip.  Ukip has suffered the mass resignation of more than a dozen senior party figures, including Farage, in recent weeks in protest at its anti-Islam focus under its leader, Gerard Batten.  Farage told the Sun on Sunday: “There is huge demand for a party that’s got real clarity on this issue. You can see and hear the frustration welling up out there. It’s clear the political elite want to stop Brexit in its tracks and the prime minister doesn’t have the strength or inclination to see this through.  “I’ve been watching events with growing dismay – I’m not the only one. Now we are putting them on notice that if Brexit doesn’t happen on 29 March we are not prepared to stand by and do nothing.”  Farage added: “If the government goes back on its word and betrays the millions of people who voted for Brexit then we need a party prepared to stand up and fight for it. I’m fully prepared for article 50 to be extended or revoked and if that happens, I will re-enter the fray.”  Blaiklock, who quit Ukip a week after Farage in December, declined to say whether the fledgling Brexit party had approached other senior Ukip figures about defecting – or whether it had lined up any wealthy donors.  Arron Banks, the businessman being investigated by the National Crime Agency over his role in the Brexit referendum, has repeatedly expressed support for a “Ukip 2.0” with Farage as its leader.  The Electoral Commission confirmed the Brexit party had applied to be registered. Its website said it would aim to decide on new political party registrations by 1 April – weeks before the local elections in England and Northern Ireland.  Blaiklock, an Oxford University-educated businesswoman, described Farage as “an international superstar” and said that, pending approval by the commission, the new party would be ready to fight elections or a second referendum should article 50 be extended beyond 29 March.  “A million more people voted for leave than remain,” she said. “What you’re saying is that it doesn’t matter what the majority is, democracy doesn’t count. You’re destroying the system. Never in a general election has anybody ever had a revote. If you take London out, leave won by 11% – not just a few per cent”.<end_of_turn>

# International experts hear southern Africa a climate change 'hot-spot' | IOL News

DURBAN – Southern Africa is on the frontline of rising global temperatures and is in need of greater research and assessment to quantify the likely effects of climate change, the department of environmental affairs (DEA) said on Monday.  DEA deputy director-general Dr. Tsakani Ngomane urged delegates at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) -- a United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change -- to discuss “climate change adaptation in the developing world”.  Ngomane was addressing experts on the first day of their week-long meeting at Durban’s Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre.  He said the IPCC special report, titled SR1.5 and finalised in October 2018, made a clear case for why global temperatures must be restricted to an increase of 1.5 °C.  “A first key message of the report is that there are substantial benefits to be achieved in terms of avoiding the climate change impacts if global warming can be restricted to 1.5 °C,” said Ngomane.  He said in the regional context, the South African interior temperatures were already about 2 °C higher than a century ago and were rising at a rate “twice the global rate of temperature increase”. This was due to systemic anthropogenic-induced climate change (induced by humans), he said.  “Further to the north, over Botswana, temperatures are rising at a rate of about 3 °C per century -- Botswana is in fact one of the regions with the highest rate of temperature increase in the entire southern hemisphere,” said Ngomane, pointing out that this had led to crop failure and the death of livestock.  He said the drought in Cape Town from 2015 to 2018 was a stark reminder of “regional climate change impacts” and that while the Mother City averted so-called day zero, when it would run out of water “…a recently published climate change attribution study tells us that the risk for droughts of this magnitude occurring in Cape Town has already increased by a factor of three, as a consequence of man-made climate change”.  “I was thus not surprised to note that SR1.5 has identified southern Africa as a climate change hot-spot region. The report clearly indicates that under 2 °C of global warming substantial increases in heat-waves, high fire-danger days and more frequent drought are likely in southern Africa. This will impact on our agriculture and water security and constrain economic growth. However, if we can restrict global warming to 1.5 °C, many of these impacts can be reduced or even avoided,” said Ngomane.  He urged the delegates to discuss “climate change adaptation in the developing world” with attention paid to assessments of “projected impacts and vulnerabilities” in areas such as “agriculture, water security, energy demand, human health and biodiversity”.  “Rapid urbanisation is expected in Africa over the next few decades and into the 21st century, and how this growth can be sustained under climate change is a critical question,” said Ngomane.  The gathering of experts, known as the “IPCC Working Group II” will deal with the impacts, adaptation and vulnerability to climate change.  The working group is made up of more than 250 delegates from around the world. Their deliberations will contribute to the “Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)” which will focus on the impacts of “climate change on natural and human systems and their vulnerabilities”.  Expected to be finished in 2021, the AR6 will be used, along with other reports, at the 2023 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to assess progress under the Paris Agreement.

# Australian Open: Nadal storms into quarter finals

The 32-year-old registered a comprehensive 6-0, 6-1, 7-6(4) win over Berdych in their pre-quarters clash that lasted two hours and five minutes.  Nadal, who made it to his 11th Australian Open quarter-final, looked at ease in the clash and barely missed any chances as Berdych failed to put a solid fight. The first set was a complete cakewalk for Nadal who won straight first nine games to take a 3-0 lead. He never let the momentum slip out of his grip and won the opening set 6-0 in a clinical fashion. Berdych seemed to have no appropriate reply to Nadal's accuracy and it continued throughout the match. While the second set saw Nadal continuing with her dominant momentum, the deciding set witnessed some grueling competition between the two players. The Spaniard, however, passed the final hurdle with distinction and won the third set 7-6 to seal the match.

# All you need to know about credit risk

ALSO READ  
													
													 All kinds of investments entail some amount of risk. Credit risk, however, takes the center stage in fixed-income investment. One of the most popular debt instruments are the debt funds. Before investing in debt funds, you need to be aware of the manner in which you may entail credit risk.  Debt funds make money by way of interest earned on the underlying assets i.e. debentures, bonds, treasury bills and the likes. Apart from that, the underlying security is obliged to repay the principal upon maturity. Debt funds are exposed to credit risk when a bond/debenture defaults on its interest/principal repayment obligations. So, in a way, investing in debt funds exposes you to credit risk indirectly.  Various rating agencies like CRISIL and ICRA assign credit ratings to debt securities which indicate their extent of creditworthiness. A higher rating indicates a lower probability of default by the issuer which issued the underlying security. These credit ratings are dynamic in nature. The ratings change as per the financial performance of the underlying security. In mutual funds, the fund manager looks at the credit rating of a security before investing in it. He/she may go for AAA-rated or below rated security as per the investment mandate of the fund. In debt funds arena, you may find funds which have no credit risk i.e. GILT funds to funds which have high credit risk.  How does credit risk affect fund NAV?  The Net Asset Value (NAV) of a debt fund is immensely affected by behavior of the underlying assets. Whenever a rating agency upgrades/downgrades the underlying security, it leads a change in the market price of the security. This leads to a change in the NAV of the debt fund. A rating downgrade on account of interest/principal repayment default usually decreases the market price of the security. This, in turn, reduces the fund NAV. Ultimately, returns on a debt fund are reflected in its NAV movement over a given time horizon. If a fund continues to experience a fall in the NAV, it means that the fund is losing money.  Debt securities which have low-credit ratings tend to give higher interest on investment. This is to compensate the investors for the undertaking high risk of investment. It is aligned to the principle that higher returns are associated with higher risk. Now, a fund manager would choose a security as per the fund’s objective. High return generating debt funds like credit opportunities fund, invest in high yield generating AA-rated or below rated securities. Conversely, other debt funds like GILT funds invest only in AAA-credit rated sovereign bonds which yield relatively moderate returns. In a nutshell, the debt fund manager tries to achieve optimal returns by managing risk.  How to manage credit risk while fund selection?  The amount of returns that you take home ultimately depends on your fund selection. While investing you need to ask yourself  What are my investment objectives? What is my risk appetite? As higher returns are associated with higher risk, you need to be clear about your risk-taking ability. Additionally, you need to prioritise wealth creation or safety of capital. If you expect higher returns from your debt fund portfolio, then you may allocate a portion to credit risk funds. But before that don’t forget to analyse its risk-adjusted returns generating ability. A look at Sharpe ratio of a debt fund, which can be found in fund’s factsheet, reflects its return potential. A credit risk fund which has a higher Sharpe ratio shows that the fund is generating enough extra returns to compensate for the high risk undertaken by way of low-credit rated securities. Conversely, if the safety of capital is your priority, then look for debt funds which invest in AAA-rated securities.   (The author is the founder & CEO of ClearTax.

# Cleanup underway after nasty winter storm dumps snow, sleet, freezing rain in Bay State

LAWRENCE, MASS. (WHDH) - Crews plowed roads throughout the night as a deep freeze took hold in the Merrimack Valley.  The weekend’s nasty winter storm left about seven inches of snow in the Andover area followed by sleet and freezing rain.  In Leominster, a salt truck rolled over due to the messy road conditions.  “His wheels started to spin, but his brakes on, and as he did, he began to slide backwards,” Raymond Racine of Leominster Public Works explained. “He made a maneuver where he chose to be safe rather than sorry, hit the tree. Flipped the truck. Everybody’s is fine.”  Across the Bay State, people rushed into the bitter air to clear their properties before the snow turned to ice.  The Rocca’s spent the afternoon shoveling out their home in Andover so they weren’t frozen in.  “We’re really surprised we didn’t get as much as they predicted but that’s good because we can go to work (Monday),” Cheryl Rocca said.  Salt trucks remained on the roads throughout the morning in an effort to remove slick spots. (Copyright (c) 2019 Sunbeam Television. All Rights Reserved.

The New Hampshire state motto, for those who may not be aware, is "live free or die"—and it's a saying that does indeed sum up the mindset of many residents of the White Mountain State, whose libertarian leanings have trickled into the laws in ways both appealing (the state is one of five without a sales tax) and foolhardy (it's the only state in the union where adults are not required by law to wear a seat belt). But even free-thinking Granite Staters have their limits as to what counts as acceptable conduct behind the wheel. Just ask 51-year-old Michael Douville of Nashua, who learned as much on January 15th—when police arrested him after allegedly spotting him smoking crack and receiving oral sex while driving. According to a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun, Manchester Police Department detectives from the Street Crimes Unit were behind a Chrysler 300 at the corner of Union Street and Valley Street when they noticed something odd, even by New Hampshire standards: the man in the driver's seat of the vehicle ahead of them appeared to be smoking a substance that was clearly not tobacco, while the female occupant seated shotgun was performing a very thorough, close-up examination of the driver's lap. Their professional curiosity aroused, the detectives walked up to the Chrysler, according to the report, identified themselves as police, and asked the driver to pull over once the light turned green. Douville, however, had other ideas; perhaps gauging the difference between his American-made sedan's top speed and that of the pedestrian cops, he took off, cutting west and through the parking lot of an Advance Auto Parts before heading back towards Union Street at what the report defines as "a high rate of speed." Quick as the alleged crack-smoking loverboy's Chrysler might have been, however, it was no match for radio waves. Having received a detailed description of the car from the detectives, Officer Robert Harrington spotted and stopped Douville's Chrysler about five blocks away from the site where he'd first been spotted allegedly in the midst of his vice squad double-down. While the female fellatiator had fled the scene separately, Harrington was able to take Douville into custody, and recovered a small amount of crack cocaine. Douville was charged with reckless conduct, possession of a controlled drug, disobeying a police officer, and of course, lewdness. He appeared in court on January 16th. And, for those of you thinking that this seems like it would make a delightful Florida Man story, well, good news: According to The Smoking Gun, Douville was convicted of misdemeanor theft in Florida back in 2016.

# Rohit’s cricket academy coming up in Chennai

Bipin Dani  Mumbai  Team India’s right-handed top order batsman Rohit Sharma’s new cricket academy will be launched in Chennai on Wednesday. 
	He is possibly the third active member of the pre-sent Indian team having a cricket academy. MS Dhoni has cricket academies in Singapore and Du-bai. Off-spinner R. Ashwin’s academy is operational in Chennai. 
	Interestingly, few Singapore cricketers (woman player captain Diviya GK, Chetan Suryawanshi and Parag Dahiwal) who are also involved with Dhoni’s academy, will be attached with Rohit Sharma’s academy also. 
	“When the CricKingdom team first approached Rohit in Mumbai in April 2018, he remarked that he had been asked many times to provide recommenda-tions to friends and kids on what academy to join but he didn’t really have the answers to that as he was unsure if the academies at the grassroots level were actually providing the holistic education and training needed to thrive in modern cricket”, Parag Dahiwal, who has repre-sented Singapore national team and now the country head-India, speaking exclusively, said. 
	“Barring his international and professional com-mitments, Rohit will be visiting the academies whenever available. Moreover, he will also have online motivational sessions for our cricketers whenever he is travelling”. 
	“Since only a select few get to represent their state or national teams, Rohit felt that it was imperative that world class training be provided to all so as to increase the talent pool”. 
	Prashant Naik – (Managing Director – CricKing-dom) is a Under 19 India and first class cricketer who played for Mumbai and was part of the Delhi Daredevils squad in the IPL will also provide coach-ing along with India’s international player Dhawal Kulkarni (Partner and Mentor). 
	Indian cricketer Abhinav Mukund will be the chief guest for the opening ceremony on Wednesday.  “Our vision is to connect cricket and technology on a single platform to enhance end-to-end academy experience and help players and coaches perform to the fullest on all levels. While doing this, we want our platform to be the best platform ever made for a sport”, Dahiwal signed off.<end_of_turn>

# To Sell Europe on Cyber Security, IBM Turns to Big Rig Operations Center

(Bloomberg) -- “Who was that just now on the phone?”Caleb Barlow, vice president of International Business Machines Corp.’s X-force threat intelligence cybersecurity team, wants to know. I’ve just fielded a call from a woman claiming to be a reporter about to publish a story that 75 million customer records have been stolen from my company and posted on the internet. I have no idea what the answer is to Barlow’s question. As a journalist, I’ve covered cyberattacks and data breaches before, but it’s my first time being on the other end of that phone call. And as I forgot to take the name of the reporter, I just failed my first test in responding to a cyber attack on Bane & Ox, a Fortune 100 financial firm.Luckily for me, neither Bane & Ox nor the cyberattack are real. They’re part of a simulation IBM is hosting to showcase the capabilities of the latest addition to its cybersecurity arsenal: a custom-built 18-wheel truck trailer containing a mobile security operations center. IBM is using the Big Rig – painted black and emblazoned with IBM’s logo and “X-Force Cyber Command” in giant white lettering on its side – to train corporate teams in how to respond to cybersecurity incidents.A year-and-a-half in development, IBM unveiled the mobile cybersecurity unit in October. After a brief tour of the U.S., it shipped the truck in December to the U.K., where on Monday it was parked in a small lot behind the National Theatre on the bank of the River Thames in London. IBM plans to take it on a mini-Grand Tour, stopping off in Dublin, Amsterdam and Madrid. When not roving, the truck will be based at IBM’s research lab in Hursley, near Winchester, England.As it wends its way through Europe, IBM is bringing in corporate teams for cybersecurity excercises, Barlow said.The first four-hour training session is free. If teams wants to conduct additional training beyond that, then IBM charges, he said. The exercises IBM conducts in the mobile unit are designed to be as realistic as possible. In the scenario I participated in, the pressure ramps up quickly: after the initial phone call from a reporter alerting Bane & Ox to the data breach, there’s a ransomware attack, employees trapped in an elevator that may have been hacked, customers calling to ask if their money is safe, rumors flying on social media, and a group of reporters that shows up at headquarters demanding answers. Barlow said the idea was to get executives to understand what it would be like to have to operate in the adrenaline-charged atmosphere and to try to build the mental “muscle memory” they would need to respond to a real incident The custom Big Rig is also a marketing billboard for Big Blue. It’ll be used to interest university students and school children in cybersecurity careers as well as to provide a command post for IBM’s own cybersecurity experts at major events like sporting championships and political conventions, Erno Doorenspleet, IBM’s global executive security adviser, said. Inside, the 23-ton trailer with expandable side panels – made for IBM by Iowa-based Featherlite Trailers and hauled by a Mercedes-Benz Actros heavy-duty tractor unit – is a fully-equipped 20-seat operations center, with banks of chairs, flat screen monitors and phones, all facing a massive high-definition video wall. It also has onboard a 100-terabyte VMWare data center – involving all solid state memory to avoid the need for any spinning parts that might be damaged by the truck’s movement while underway. The whole system can be powered by a 47-kilowatt generator, with enough fuel onboard to run for two days. Although the company declined to say how much it had spent on the mobile operations center, Barlow said it was part of 155-million-pound ($200 million) investment IBM has made in cyber incident response since 2016.That was the year IBM began conducting cyberincident response simulations for corporate customers at a facility in Cambridge, Massachussetts. Barlow said 2,500 IBM clients had been through this training. But, Barlow said, his team realized that more than a quarter of the companies attending the Cambridge “Cyber Range” were European and that IBM needed to find a way to make it easier for continental companies to access this training without having to fly to the U.S.Nick Coleman, a former U.K. government security official who’s now IBM’s Cybersecurity Global Leader, said that the demand for cybersecurity incident response training was particularly acute in Europe, citing figures from a 2018 U.K. government report that while 40 percent of U.K. companies reported having experienced a data breach and 74 percent said such breaches were a “high priority,” only 13 percent said they had an incident response process in place.

# Our pupils no longer share books, says PS

Irene Githinji @gitshee  The government has distributed 60 million textbooks to public schools and achieved the desired 1:1 textbook to learner ratio for effective teaching and learning.  Education PS Belio Kipsang said the government, in conjunction with USAid, Global Partnership in Education (GPE) and the World Bank, had cumulatively distributed the textbooks to improve literacy and numeracy in Early Years of Education (EYE) besides the Secondary Education Quality Improvement Project (SEQIP).  He made the remarks when he received a 14-member delegation from Zambia, which is on a four-day benchmarking tour on Kenya’s public education system at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD).  Belio also said the tour will provide an opportunity for sector policymakers in the two countries to share experiences on how best educational services are delivered.  On his part, Zambia PS for General Education Felix Phiri said his government had achieved a book to student ratio of 1:5, which he termed a challenge in delivery of quality education.  “We dream of the 1:1 textbook to pupil ratio you have attained. We are in Kenya to learn what it has done to ensure learners access textbooks, which are essential for quality education,” Phiri said.  The delegation from Zambia is also seeking to understand how the ministry handles teacher training particularly in the teaching of Mathematics and Science curriculum in secondary education and management and administration of national exams.  The team will visit schools in Nyeri and Murang’a counties as well as Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology Training in Africa (CEMASTEA), Teachers Service Commission (TSC) and the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) for briefing on their respective functions, policies, programmes and initiatives.<end_of_turn>

# cineSarnia presents inspirational Canadian film, The Grizzlies

The Grizzlies is the uplifting true story of an idealistic young teacher who travels to the farthest reaches of Canada’s north to inspire Inuit youth through the game of lacrosse, only to receive an education of his own about the culture, social issues and ultimately resilience of the Inuit.  cineSarnia will be screening the breakout Canadian film at the Sarnia Public Library Theatre on Sunday, Jan. 27 and Monday, Jan. 28 beginning at 7:30 p.m.  Featuring the stunning cinematography of Nunavut’s bleak yet beautiful landscape, The Grizzlies is a refreshing variation on the well-trodden path of inspirational sports stories as well as a sombre look at the harsh realities of life in an Arctic village.  Set in 1998, the film tracks the travails of recent teacher’s college graduate Russ Sheppard (played by Ben Schnetzer) who takes his first teaching job in Kugluktuk, Nunavut. Shortly after his arrival in the village, Sheppard comes face to face with issues such as addiction, depression and suicide.  Unsure of how to motivate the local youth, he introduces a lacrosse program at the school, which at first is met with resistance. But through the sheer force of will Sheppard wins the trust of the students, who join the team – the Grizzlies – which provides him (and the audience) with some insight and enlightenment about their struggles and complex lives.  The 2018 film, which won heaps of praise after it was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival last fall, was directed by two-time Canadian Screen Awards winner Miranda de Pencier and stars several Nunavut-based newcomers who absolutely command the screen, said cineSarnia’s Anne West, particularly Paul Nutarariaq and Emerald MacDonald.  The Grizzlies is a thoughtful yet entertaining film that will appeal to a wide audience because of its universal themes and its genuine, laid back charm, West said.  “At heart it’s a sports film but it’s really about an education for this young teacher as well us for an audience,” she said. “They have one of the highest suicide rates in North America as well as leftover feelings of marginalization and colonization, so they explore a lot of the north versus south themes we have in Canada.”  West added: “Several of the producers of this film are Inuit and they used local actors too, some of them for first time onscreen in a major film. And they give some absolutely powerful performances.”  Regardless of whether you are a sports fanatic or not, the Grizzlies will move you, West said.  “It’s kind of a feel good story – the group travels outside their community to compete and their own community gets behind them. But it’s much more than an underdog sports film – it has a lot to do with giving hope to these youth.”  Rush seats are available for both showings of The Grizzlies for $10, beginning at 7:15 p.m.  For those requiring assistance, the library’s elevator runs on Sunday and Monday evenings from 6:45 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. Filmgoers are also asked to refrain from using scented products out of consideration for others.

# Mesoporous nickel could help to expand capacity of hydrogen engines and solar cells

Scientists of the Far Eastern Federal University (FEFU), together with Russian and foreign colleagues, developed samples of nickel mesoporous film structures, which have useful surface area up to 400 time greater than their solid one. Brand-new material can be used in the energy saving, chemical industry and other practical areas. The research results are published in Applied Surface Science journal. According to Alexander Samardak, a principal investigator, an associate professor of the Computer Systems Department at the School of Natural Sciences of FEFU, the creation of magnetic porous systems is an up-and-coming field, which is yet poorly studied. The structure of nanoporous materials is similar to a conventional sponge, which can accommodate significant volumes of substance, thus the useful surface area of the sponge is much larger than its size. "The pores we obtained are very small, 4-5 nanometers, but thanks to them the total surface area of the material is increased 400 times. These unique properties grant the wide potential application of the material. Using such materials, one can create filters for cleaning and adsorption of ultrafine magnetic particles, media for storing substances, in particular, for hydrogen engines, where fuel storage cells are needed. In the future, they may be applied in the production of solar and lithium-ion batteries, in nanoelectronics and the automotive industry," said Alexander Samardak. The unique material is obtained via electrodeposition of nickel particles on an artificial framework of a surfactant (SAS), which gives a structure of nanotube array composed by micelles. After electrodeposition, the framework dissolves in water and leaves behind only mesoporous nickel. Scientists have determined that when using a certain concentration of surfactants (30 weight percent), the nickel frame structure does not grow randomly, but in the form of hexagonally ordered nanotubes. This unique feature was observed by high resolution transmission electron microscope operated by Dr. Alexey Ognev from FEFU. This opens up additional possibilities for this material application in the field of magnetic sensors and activators for nanoelectronics. This study is the collaborative work of scientists from the laboratory of thin film technologies, Department of Physics of Low-Dimensional Structures of the School of Natural Sciences, FEFU, with researchers from Iran and Romania. The research process was supported by Technoline Company (Vladivostok), which provided the state-of-art equipment. FEFU has a priority research project "Materials", where a group of talented young physicists, chemists, biologists and materials scientists cooperates. To date, scientists have made significant progress in creating new materials. Among the unique developments are cobalt and iron nanosprings obtained by scientists from the School of Natural Sciences and Korea University (Republic of Korea). Thanks to a combination of magnetic properties and the ability to maintain elasticity, they can be used to create nanorobots, nanosensors, new types of memory, agents for targeted drug delivery, and other purposes.  ###<end_of_turn>

# Blind Man Set To Sail Boat From San Diego To Japan

A blind San Diego resident is getting ready for the journey of a lifetime: a 60 day sailing trip to Fukushima, Japan. “I can feel nature very much with sailing,” said Hiro Iwamoto. “And I can be a driver. I can’t do that in a car on the street but I can in the ocean with a boat!” With the help of a sighted sailor, Doug Smith, the two will leave on February 24 aboard the Dream Weaver, a 40-foot sail boat. "The boat is big enough to be comfortable and safe for a voyage but still small enough," said Smith. Iwamoto was born in Tokyo and now lives in San Diego with his wife and daughter. He lost his sight as a teenager. "Growing up, my father had a fishing boat," said Iwamoto. "I have always loved the ocean." If the trip is successful, Iwamoto will be the first blind person to complete a crossing of the Pacific as part of a two-person crew. Iwamoto attempted to make the journey in 2013, but the voyage ended prematurely. "We had a collision with a whale and the boat got a giant crack and sank," said Iwamoto. "We were floating around in 15 foot waves before rescue came." After that, Iwamoto did not want to sail for a long time. He said he will be sailing again both to raise money for charity and to show people that you should conquer your fears. "Failure can make your future success one thousand times greater, so never give up," said Iwamoto. The boat will have a tracking device on it so that fans can follow Iwamoto online during his journey.<end_of_turn>

# Gardai raid 'ISIS cash gang' after tip off by bank

A bank alerted gardai to a suspected Islamist financier and his family over suspicions they were collecting tens of thousands of euro for ISIS.  Anti-terrorism detectives, money laundering and Garda intelligence officers raided six addresses in Dublin.  These were targeted over the activities of a family suspected of sending money to the Islamic terror group and other dangerous fundamentalists.  A source said: “It is understood a bank had alerted gardai to irregular transactions by a suspect living in Dublin.  “Members of the force’s security and intelligence unit examined these transactions, worth tens of thousands of euro, and it was decided to move in on the suspects.  “A man, who gardai have particular interest in, and three women were arrested. It’s believed they have been in Ireland for less than five years.  “There are no immediate signs there was any attack here in Ireland.  “The probe centres on fundraising and sending the money on.”  Sources also revealed the money was gathered by a man known to gardai.  One added: “The four arrested people were together and it is believed the man is of particular interest to gardai.  There will be a lot of liaising with international intelligence services and Interpol. This again shows the international nature of terrorist financing – they pay no heed to borders.  “As ISIS is sustaining heavy losses in Syria, it needs more and more money for its operations.”  A Garda spokesman confirmed the arrests had been made but the inquiry was ongoing.  He said: “As part of an ongoing investigation by the Special Detective Unit, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and Security & Intelligence into international terrorist financing, six searches were conducted in Dublin.  “Documents, electronic equipment and €4,500 cash was seized.Four persons were arrested for suspected terrorist financing contrary to Section 13 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act, 2005 and are currently detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 at Dublin Garda Stations.  “The arrested persons are a man in his 40s, three females, one in her 30s, one in her 40s and one in her 60s.  “The investigation is ongoing.”  It is not the first time gardai have investigated allegations against a suspected ISIS financier. Waterford man Hassan Bal, who is in his late 20s, was sentenced to two-and-a-half years imprisonment last year.  A radicalisation report revealed he had become a fundamentalist jihadi because he had guilt and shame for living a Western lifestyle.  Supt Anthony Pettit told Waterford Circuit Criminal Court the case was uncovered when an investigative journalist from a British Sunday newspaper alerted UK police.  The witness told the court the reporter, who uses the alias Omar Wahid, pretended to be a jihadi sympathiser and offered a donation of €1,000 to the ISIS cause.  He made contact with Omar Hussein, a British-based ISIS operative, dubbed the Supermarket Jihadi, who also uses the alias Abu Abdul Rahman Britani.  Bal was using the social media messaging service Kick to communicate with all the moving parts including the undercover journalist.  The court heard the Supermarket Jihadi contacted Bal who was sending the money to another ISIS fundraiser in Bosnia.  The court was told the arrangement was the money would be dropped at a building firm in London and Bal, who was in Ireland, would send his brother to collect it.  The investigative reporter alerted police in the UK who then alerted gardai who made the arrest. Earlier this month, Irish passport holder Alexandr Ruzmatovich Bekmirzaev, a naturalised citizen, was arrested by forces fighting ISIS in Syria.  The Irish Mirror revealed he had been radicalised in Ireland.  He was arrested with Americans Warren Clark and Zaid Abed al-Hamid by Kurdish soldiers fighting ISIS.  He arrived from Belarus in 2000 then lived and worked in Dublin until 2013.  During that time he met and married an Eastern European woman and the couple had a child.  A source said it is not believed Bekmirzaev’s arrest is linked to the current suspected ISIS fundraising operation in Dublin.  The contact said: “It is unlikely there’s a connection but certainly gardai would check whether there are links to the suspects arrested today.  “There would have been a wide investigation into all connections of Bekmirzaev’s and these suspects to determine who they were in contact with.  “If you look at the Bal case – this was money coming from Ireland to Bosnia then on to the Middle East – there are massive connections right across the globe for these financiers.”  How to follow the Irish Mirror on social media  You can like our main Facebook page here.

# Former Fort Hood soldier sues 3M Company over earplugs

Former Army Sgt. Scott D. Rowe, a combat veteran previously stationed at Fort Hood, is suing 3M Company over what he says were defective earplugs, causing him permanent hearing loss, tinnitus and poor balance. The lawsuit, that was filed Tuesday morning, claims that 3M Company knowingly designed, made and sold the defective dual-ended Combat Arms earplugs without warning the users about any defects. 3M issued the earplugs to U.S. soldiers for over a decade between 2002 and 2013. Rowe is represented by Mo Aziz and Andrew Cobos of the Houston-based law firm Abraham, Watkins, Nichols, Sorrels, Agosto & Aziz. During his military career, Rowe was stationed at Fort Hood and Fort Lewis, Wash., and deployed to Iraq from 2003 to 2004 as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Like many other service members during this timeframe, Rowe was issued the earplugs while serving in Iraq. “It is reprehensible for a U.S. corporation, in this case 3M, to knowingly supply defective products to the U.S. military,” said Rowe’s attorney Cobos in a news release published by his law firm. “These service members are overseas, such as in Iraq and Afghanistan, putting their lives on the line. The last thing they should have to worry about is the adequacy of their equipment.” According to Rowe’s law team, the stem of the earplug is too short, making it difficult for people to insert the plugs deeply in the ear canal. The defect causes the earplug to loosen in the ear, allowing sounds to enter the ear canal around the plug.  The earplugs were originally developed by Aearo Technologies, which was acquired by 3M in 2008. According to news reports, 3M Company reached a $9.1 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice last year for selling the defective earplugs to the military. The settlement was reached over allegations without any proven liability. Rowe is suing for an unspecified amount of damages, including the cost of past and future medical expenses, pain and suffering, physical disfigurement, physical impairment, mental anguish and loss of wages and earning capacity. Although veterans may have used the earplugs over a decade ago, they might still be eligible for compensation. “Sgt. Rowe’s lawsuit is his first step to hold 3M accountable for his lifelong tinnitus condition,” said his attorney Aziz. “Veterans injured by 3M’s conduct have similar legal rights.”<end_of_turn>

# Is Resident Evil 2 the Best Survival Horror Game Ever Made?

Resident Evil 2 is out and it is fantastic, which means that it gets a prominent mention on this week's episode of Transition. Games editor Rishi Alwani and friend of the podcast Mikhail Madnani join host Pranay Parab to talk about the game, which is one of the best survival horror games around right now. We begin this episode by talking about Resident Evil, but not the kind of Resident Evil the headline suggests. Then we talk about the best Resident Evil games in the series and which ones you should play before playing Resident Evil 2. Then we mention how Resident Evil 2 is now different from the original game and what you need to watch out for. Next, we talk about the gunplay in Resident Evil 2 since that's what a lot of people will be buying this game for. We look at AI difficulty in this game and mention how easy or difficult it is to kill monsters in this game. We draw a small parallel between Resident Evil 2 and The Last of Us in this episode. We mention the kind of horror in Resident Evil 2 and how much the game uses jump scares. We also briefly talk about Resident Evil 2's story and what changes players can expect from the remake. Finally, we talk about Resident Evil 2 on PS4, Xbox, and PC, and which version people should be buying. Then we end the episode by talking about the games we've been playing this week. This includes Ace Combat 7, Ace Combat 5, Chrono Trigger, Overwatch, Red Dead Redemption 2, and My Name Is Mayo.

# This Kerala woman is a teacher nonpareil

KOCHI: A motivator, problem solver and an ideal teacher, she skilfully manages all these roles with ease and a smile. For Renuka Kumari S, who won a National Award for the ‘Best Anganwadi Worker’, her world revolves around children. “I joined the service in 1985, it’s been 33 years. I currently work at the Anganwadi located at Ward 17 of Thrikkannapuram, Thirumala. It is a pleasure to spend time with those little angles, their smiles and naughty talks,” says Renuka Kumari S. She also informed that they follow an activity-based learning module at the Anganwadi.  It was her love towards teaching and children that lead to joining an Anganwadi at the age of 18. “Early education plays an important role in moulding a child’s behaviour. They need immense love, attention and care at this point of their life,” says Renuka. She also informed that she was one among the core members to design, ‘Angana Thaimavu’, the syllabus for Anganwadi students. A separate workbook called ‘Anganappomazha’ has also been modelled which focuses on developing problem-solving skills, critical-analytical thinking and strengthening language skills.  Renuka feels that when 100 per cent is put into work that one loves, results will be achieved. “I’m happy that I got selected by the Kerala State Government for the ‘Best Anganwadi Teacher’ award for the year 2016-2017.  I will be receiving the award for the same on May 8 2019, on the occasion of International Women’s Day,” says Renuka. The National award for ‘Best Anganwadi Worker’ for the year 2017-2018 was handed over to her by the Minister of Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi on January 7, 2019, at Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra, New Delhi.  While she plans to continue the projects under Integrated Child Development Services which includes organising campaigns regarding waste management, immunity awareness classes among students and parents, eye-check ups for children, Aadhaar enrolment of children under age five, and anti-drug abuse campaigns, she tries to spread awareness about the importance of physical education among children.  
 “Children should be introduced to good health and nutritious food from a young age. They should understand the need to have a fit and healthy body, everyday activities for an hour would be sufficient for children, which we are planning to add to the curriculum,” she adds.<end_of_turn>

# Aus Open PIX: Pliskova knocks out Serena; sets up Osaka semi-final

Serena Williams squandered four match points and blew a 5-1 lead in the decider to fall to seventh seed Karolina Pliskova 6-4 4-6 7-5 in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open on Wednesday.  Williams also saved two match points in the last game but netted on the third in a stunning loss to the big-serving Czech at Rod Laver Arena. Pliskova advances to meet Naomi Osaka for a place in the final. US Open champion Naomi Osaka set up a potential rematch of her controversial Flushing Meadows final against Serena Williams after beating Elina Svitolina 6-4, 6-1 to reach her first Australian Open semi-final on Wednesday.  The 21-year-old Osaka committed a string of unforced errors but still proved too strong for the sixth-seeded Ukrainian, wrapping up the win in an hour and 12 minutes to become the first Japanese woman to reach the last four at Melbourne Park since Kimiko Date in 1994. Osaka's first Grand Slam triumph at the US Open last year was overshadowed by a row between Williams and umpire Carlos Ramos. The American is playing Karolina Pliskova in the remaining quarter-final. "I played them both and they are both very great players," said Osaka after her match at Rod Laver Arena. "And I know that it's going to be tough no matter who I play, and honestly I'm just trying to go inside because it's little bit hot right now. Sorry," she added as the crowd burst into laughter. Osaka's power was on full display against WTA Finals champion Svitolina, with the Japanese thumping 31 winners to her opponent's 11. But she was also sloppy at times, committing 25 unforced errors, nine more than Svitolina. The 24-year-old Ukrainian kept her errors in check to get two service breaks back and stay in the opening set at 4-5. Osaka blew three set point opportunities on Svitolina's next serve with three embarrassing errors, berating herself with angry slaps on the thigh. However, the Japanese gathered herself and hit a crisp backhand to set up a fourth chance, and converted it when Svitolina thumped a return into the net. The Ukrainian took a medical timeout in the second set for neck and shoulder problems with Osaka up 3-0 but she was broken again after returning to the court. "I felt pain from the beginning of the tournament here and there. It was going and coming back," Svitolina said. "Unfortunately today was a little bit worse than I expected. "It's normal to have some tension during the Grand Slam and it happens, but unfortunately I couldn't handle it today." Fourth seed Osaka served her eighth ace then converted her first match point with an overhead winner to seal the win.<end_of_turn>

# E Nomine - New Songs, Playlists & Latest News - BBC Music

E Nomine Biography (Wikipedia)  E Nomine (from the Latin In Nomine, "In The Name Of") is a German musical project, formed in 1999, by producers Christian Weller and Friedrich "Fritz" Graner. Their music, which they call monumental vocal style, is a combination of trance, techno, and vocals which closely resemble Gregorian singing and chanting. Other vocals are performed by German voice actors such as long-time collaborators Christian Brückner and Rolf Schult. The primary languages in the songs are German and Latin. The project released its first album, Das Testament, in 1999. It was followed by Finsternis in 2002, Die Prophezeiung in 2003 and a compilation in 2004 (Das Beste aus... Gottes Beitrag und Teufels Werk), which also included new songs. After a few years with no news of the project, e-mail correspondence between a fan and Chris Tentum (Weller) revealed that the group was in the process of producing new material, due for release some time in the near future. A year after this came to light, a new single from E Nomine appeared on Amazon.de entitled Heilig, due for release on December 28, 2007. The release date was pushed to mid-February 2008. Due to problems with their publisher, hard copies were never shipped, and the song was only made available for download.<end_of_turn>

# Community outrage at Hacienda rape could result in new laws, more oversight

Outrage over a "monstrous and unspeakable crime" may lead to more oversight of vulnerable patients in Arizona. The rape of a 29-year-old patient at Hacienda HealthCare in Phoenix shows "failure at every level," Arizona House Minority Leader Charlene Fernandez, D-Yuma, told a standing-room-only crowd that filled an old Arizona Supreme Court room at the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon. The meeting occurred, by coincidence, on the same day that one of the Hacienda HealthCare patient's caregivers — licensed practical nurse Nathan Sutherland — was arrested and accused of her sexual assault. Every member of Arizona's congressional delegation sent a representative to the meeting, underscoring the bipartisan community interest in what happened at Hacienda HealthCare. Among key suggestions offered at the meeting, hosted by the Arizona Developmental Disabilities Planning Council, were improving screening and training for caregivers of people with disabilities. The 23-member council is appointed by Gov. Doug Ducey. Christina Corieri, a senior Ducey policy adviser, called the rape a "monstrous and unspeakable crime." Council will release report The council on Monday is scheduled to release a report about systemic shortcomings in addressing sexual abuse of people with disabilities in Arizona. A task force on the issue formed in September, not knowing its work would become a focus of such widespread interest. The report will include some of the feedback from Wednesday's gathering, such as comments from state Rep. Jennifer Longdon, a Phoenix Democrat, that people with disabilities need to have their own category for data on victims of sexual violence. "We exist and need to be counted," she said. Longdon added that what happened at Hacienda is not isolated. "For far too many of them, this is their daily lived experience," she said. Ideas include more fingerprint reviews Ideas from the public included increasing the frequency of fingerprint-card reviews. While workers at facilities for people with disabilities are required to provide fingerprints for background checks in order to work in facilities like Hacienda HealthCare, the prints are currently reviewed every six years, said Asim Dietrich, a staff attorney at the Arizona Center for Disability Law. Dietrich said annual reviews could improve safety for people with disabilities, as would better training for clients, staff and family members of people with disabilities about recognizing signs of abuse and neglect. Another suggestion was for comprehensive rape-crisis services in Arizona. Some community members called on Arizona's Adult Protective Services to give more credibility to people with disabilities as witnesses in reported cases of abuse and neglect against vulnerable adults. Others said there should be more awareness of mandatory reporting and of the Arizona Adult Protective Services registry of known perpetrators against vulnerable adults. But it's still difficult to find quality measures on facilities for vulnerable adults, whether they are elderly or have developmental disabilities, several community members said. Abuse of people with disabilities 'a far greater problem' than most realize "Abuse and violence against individuals with disabilities is a far greater problem than most of us recognize," said Jon Meyers, executive director of the Arc of Arizona, which advocates and offers support to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families throughout the state. "The statistics are overwhelming and we must do something about that as a state." Some attendees suggested putting cameras in facilities such as Hacienda, but Meyers stressed that preserving patients' rights is important, too. What happened with the victim in the Hacienda case is "far more common than we realize," Fernandez said. "We as a community can do better."<end_of_turn>

# The Latest: Experts: PG&E bankruptcy still likely

The Latest on the cause of a 2017 California wildfire that killed 22 people (all times local):  4:50 p.m.  Legal experts say a determination that Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. equipment was not to blame for a deadly 2017 California wildfire will probably not stop the utility from going ahead with its planned bankruptcy.  The company still faces billions of dollars in potential damages from other wildfires, including a 2018 blaze that took at least 86 lives and became the worst in the state's history. Bankruptcy would also give the company space to formulate a plan to prevent its equipment from causing more catastrophic fires in the future.

Gavin Newsom says more than half of the debt PG&E says it might owe stems from a fire that investigators said Thursday the utility did not cause, putting its bankruptcy plans into doubt.  State fire investigators released a report saying that the deadly 2017 Tubbs Fire that scorched Napa and Sonoma counties was caused by privately maintained electric lines.  The newly elected Democrat said his office estimates that $17 billion of the $30 billion Pacific Gas & Electric estimates as potential liabilities from wildfire-related lawsuits in 2017 and 2018 was due to the Tubbs Fire.  The utility company said in response to Newsom's math that it still faces extensive litigation.  Newsom said the issue is likely far from settled legally and that he's asked the newly appointed Commission on Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery to speed up its recommendations.  ___  1:40 p.m.  Northern California's major electricity and natural gas provider says it's still in deep trouble despite being cleared of causing a 2017 wine country fire that killed 22 people.  State investigators on Thursday said the Tubbs Fire in Napa and Sonoma counties was started by electrical equipment at a private residence in the Napa Valley and not by Pacific Gas and Electric Co.  Company spokesman James Noonan says in a statement that PG&E still faces numerous lawsuits, significant potential damages and a deteriorating financial situation because of the fires that torched California in 2017 and 2018.  The company says it plans to declare bankruptcy after it was blamed for causing numerous other fires that killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes. It says it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages.  ___  1:15 p.m.  A Northern California state senator said that just because a private electric line caused one of the deadliest wildfires in state history does not let Pacific Gas & Electric off the hook for its role in other devastating fires in the state.  California officials said Thursday that a private electric line was responsible for a 2017 blaze in wine country that killed 22 people and destroyed thousands of homes.  State Sen. Bill Dodd, a Napa Democrat, said the finding doesn't negate the systemwide issues plaguing California's largest utility.  PG&E previously said it plans to file for bankruptcy protection because it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits involving the possible role of its equipment in catastrophic wildfires in California in the past two years.  PG&E did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ___  12:45 p.m.  Investigators say a deadly 2017 wildfire that killed 22 people in Northern California wine country was caused by a private electrical system, not equipment of embattled Pacific Gas & Electric Co.  The state's firefighting agency said Thursday that the fire started next to a residence. The agency did not find any violations of state law.  The fire was one of more than 170 fires that torched the state in October 2017. It destroyed more than 5,600 structures over more than 57 square miles (148 sq. kilometers) in Sonoma County.  The cause came as a relief to PG&E, which plans to file for bankruptcy protection next week, citing billions of potential damages from other deadly and destructive wildfires.  CalFire did not immediately release its full fire cause report.<end_of_turn>

# Sweethearts candies won't be on shelves this Valentine's

Sweethearts candies won't be on shelves this Valentine's  DETROIT (AP) — Sweethearts — those chalky little candies with messages on them — won't be on store shelves this Valentine's Day.  The New England Confectionary Co. — or Necco — had been making the popular candies since 1886. But the company filed for bankruptcy protection last spring.  Ohio-based Spangler Candy Co. bought Necco in May. But Spangler said Thursday that it didn't have time to bring Sweethearts to market this Valentine's season.  CEO Kirk Vashaw said Spangler wants to make sure Sweethearts "meet customer expectations" when they return to market. He didn't say what changes Spangler plans to make or when they'll go back on sale.  Competitors like Brach's are still making conversation hearts. But online retailer CandyStore.com says Sweethearts were by far the most popular brand, commanding 80 percent of U.S. market for candy hearts.<end_of_turn>

# Arizona may be closer than ever to banning cellphone use while driving, after officer's death

Arizona is one of three states where texting and driving is legal for all or some drivers. A new bill aims to ban handheld-phone use while driving. Thomas Hawthorne, The Republic | azcentral.com "Enough is enough." Standing outside of the state Capitol on Thursday, Peter Johnson said it's time for state lawmakers to ban the use of cellphones while driving. The issue is personal to him. His daughter is Deanna Townsend, who lost her husband, Salt River tribal police Officer Clayton Townsend, earlier this month at the hands of a driver who was looking at his phone. "It's a social standard that everyone thinks is OK, and it's not," he said at a news conference. "We have to get the phones out of our hands. We have to stop it. This is the time." The family was there to support a bill introduced Wednesday by Republican state Sen. Kate Brophy McGee, R-Phoenix, that would enact a statewide ban on hand-held cellphone use while driving. The new push comes after the Arizona Legislature has considered, but failed to enact, bans on texting while driving every year for more than a decade. Currently, texting and driving is only banned for new, teen drivers. At this point, Arizona is one of just three states without a texting ban for all drivers. This year, though, may be different There's new leadership in both legislative chambers, McGee said, and they are supportive of the proposal. There's also complete support from law enforcement in the state, who have now lost two of their own to distracted drivers since 2013. And, she said, there's momentum. "It was best stated in the panel I attended yesterday on distracted driving," McGee said. "This is the DUI issue of our time. And we need to educate and re-culture our driving public to follow the rules." New bill takes strict approach McGee's bill, Senate Bill 1165, takes a much stricter approach than other related bills introduced this year and in past years. For 12 straight years, former state Sen. Steve Farley, D-Tucson, introduced a bill to ban texting while driving. Farley gave up his seat to run for governor last year. Earlier this month, state Sen. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, introduced a bill to ban texting while driving. He introduced a similar bill last year. State Sen. J.D. Mesnard also introduced a related bill this year that would ban drivers from any type of distracted driving that creates a hazard. McGee said the law needs to be specific to cellphone use in order to raise awareness of the danger of using a cellphone while driving. Nationally, about 10 percent of about 35,000 people who died in vehicle crashes in 2015 died at the hands of a distracted driver, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Her bill would specifically prohibit drivers from any kind of cellphone use while driving — including to talk, text, type or browse social media sites — unless they are using the device in a hands-free mode. The bill would allow a driver to activate or deactivate a feature or function on the phone — like accepting a phone call — if it's docked on the windshield, dashboard or center console. Drivers could still use their phone in an emergency, and law enforcement and emergency personnel could still use their devices for work. The fine for drivers who break the law would be between $75 and $149 on first offense and between $150 and $250 on second offense and any subsequent offense. As written now, the law would be a primary offense, which means that police could pull over drivers for this reason alone. McGee said she wouldn't accept anything less. Support from leadership Last year, the Legislature enacted the texting ban for teen drivers. Republican Senate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, introduced that bill. She said Thursday that she would have gone further and proposed a ban for all drivers, but she made a promise to then-House Speaker J.D. Mesnard that she wouldn't. This year, Mesnard moved to the senate. Former senate President Andy Biggs, who opposed a texting ban because he said already-existing distracted driving laws could be used to cite drivers on their cell phones, is now a congressman. Fann, along with several other state lawmakers, showed up Thursday to show support for McGee's bill. She said Gov. Doug Ducey wanted to be there, and the bill has bipartisan support. She and others talked confidently about their plans to enact the bill this year. But after the news conference, McGee told The Arizona Republic she's not sure whether it will pass. The challenge, she said, will be getting what she called "small government conservatives," to support the bill. Some of the language in the bill intended to protect drivers' privacy could help bring consensus. The way it's written now, police who stop drivers would not have the right to check the drivers' phones to see whether they were using it at the time they were pulled over. That raises questions about enforcement. But Oro Valley Police Chief Daniel Sharp said at the news conference that all officers have to do to enforce the law is see someone holding their phone, they don't need to check what they were doing with it. Oro Valley has an ordinance, Sharp said, and it hasn't had problems enforcing the law. Will Townsend's death spur law? Townsend, 26, was struck and killed Jan. 8 by a driver who was looking at his phone while driving along the Loop 101 near Scottsdale. He leaves behind Deanna and 10-month-old son, Brixton. But just because there was a high-profile death related to distracted driving doesn't mean the Legislature will be convinced of the need for a ban. In 2013, Department of Public Safety Officer Tim Huffman was killed by a trucker scrolling through Facebook while driving down Interstate 8. After, his family vowed to fight for stricter laws and longer sentencing requirements. They pushed for what they called "Uncle Tim's Law," a bill that would make texting while driving illegal. It did not pass. City laws create patchwork Other than Arizona, the only other places some drivers can text and drive legally in the United States is Missouri and Montana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Sixteen states have a blanket ban on handheld-cellphone use while driving. In recent months, more cities in the Valley have started to enact their own bans. That includes three West Valley cities, El Mirage, Glendale and Surprise. Elsewhere in the Valley, Fountain Hills and Phoenix prohibit texting while driving, and Tempe prohibits talking on the phone or texting, but only if police can prove the driver poses a risk to themselves or others, and it's a secondary offense. Outside of the Valley Arizona cities that prohibit handheld-cellphone use while driving include: Bisbee, Clifton, Chino Valley, Flagstaff (texting ban only), Kingman, Oro Valley, Prescott, San Luis, Sedona, Tucson and Yuma. Coconino, Pima and Yavapai counties also prohibit handheld cellphone use while driving. Cities' action have created what law enforcement and elected officials refer to as patchwork. "We are at the point now we need one, statewide law," Fann said. READ MORE:<end_of_turn>

# Tony Romo-stradamus is soaring in popularity with his uncanny knack for predicting plays

After correctly predicting at least a dozen plays before they happened during last Sunday’s AFC Championship game, football fans can only wonder if Tony Romo-stradamus will be as prophetic with his forecasts when he calls Super Bowl LIII. The former Cowboys quarterback was eerily accurate in diagnosing plays during the Patriots’ 37-31 overtime victory over the Chiefs, so much so that he earned the nickname “Romo-stradamus” by his CBS Sports broadcast partner, Jim Nantz. The two announcers will be back in the booth when the Patriots meet the Rams in Super Bowl LIII on Feb. 3 in Atlanta and Romo figures to be one of the hottest stories leading up to the game. His status as a young NFL analyst has skyrocketed following his calls in the AFC title game, which drew nearly 54 million viewers. There has been talk that CBS is prepared to double his salary after all the positive feedback Romo and the network has received. Romo, 38, is completing the second year of a three-year deal with CBS that pays him $4 million annually. He’s so hot at the moment, other networks almost certainly will try to make a play for him as well. It’s even been suggested he might be lured back to the NFL as an offensive coordinator or even a head coach. During a conference call with NFL writers on Wednesday, however, Romo politely brushed off such speculation and said he’s perfectly content to keep doing what he’s doing with CBS. “The funny thing is, I’m still a part of the game so it’s not like you’re removed from the game,” Romo said. “The energy and the stuff you love about the game, you feel that when you’re an analyst. I never say never to anything. Obviously, I’ve said this plenty of times – I’m really happy where I’m at. I love where my life is. “I’m sure at some point in my life, 25 years from now, you’ll want to do something competitive in that regard. But I feel very happy and comfortable and I like where my life is. I like where I’m at. I like what’s going. I really enjoy the schedule I have. I have three young boys, I have a wife, so I don’t think about that right now at all, no.” Asked to explain how he managed to be so spot-on when predicting plays during the Patriots-Chiefs game, especially in overtime while New England was driving for a game-winning touchdown, Romo was just as coy. “The game kind of calls itself,” Romo said, laughing. “When you’re young in your career, you go in with all this planning of everything and you want to be prepared so you have all the information. But I try not to pre-determine too much stuff you’re going to day because I feel like the game is the story and you’re just going to call it. “Sometimes, you just get passionate, you get excited in the moment and you start just really talking out loud what’s going through your brain. Sometimes, you see a lot of stuff and then you try to articulate that to the people who are watching. I feel like there’s no real big planned thing. I think sometimes it just happens and once in a blue moon you get lucky, you might say something right.” Gene Steratore, the NFL rules analyst who sits in the CBS booth with Romo and Nantz, has a theory as to why Romo was so accurate in his play-calling predictions. It all goes back, Steratore said, to Romo’s 14 seasons as an NFL quarterback. “I chalk up a lot of it to the fact that he and Tom Brady are seeing the same thing,” Steratore said. “People think Tony’s a fortune teller. But this isn’t guess work and this isn’t psychic ability. This is a testimonial to a guy who obviously in his career spent a lot of time figuring it out. And Tom Brady has too. That’s why he’s able to complete three third-and-10s in overtime and take them down for the winning touchdown. “I mean, my partner had to have been, in his Cowboys’ days and remains to this day, some sort of like sick, film-room guru who took the time that was needed to completely solve the puzzle. So when we have these key moments late in the game, and we’re all dazzled at what he’s doing, this is a testament to the years and years that he’s worked at preparation. “He’s not guessing. He’s not getting some sort of message from the gods. He’s seeing what Brady saw. He sees the wrinkles, he sees the opening and basically, he’s suggesting this is where the play should go and it just married up. It was in perfect symmetry with what Brady had been seeing, too, but you’re talking about two quarterbacks who played or did play for a long time and put the effort and work in to be as good as they can be. We’re the beneficiaries of it at CBS, but the viewers are more than anybody. I mean, they’re having a wonderful ride along the way, being able to hear a game being broadcast and tipped off like they’ve never been before.” READ MORE Jim Nantz on Tony Romo's predictions: Not getting a message from the gods Tony Romo applies prediction power to Bryce Harper's free agency Tony Romo reveals Cardinals' interest in QB ... in 2003 Reach McManaman at bob.mcmanaman@arizonarepublic.com.

# HBOT showed improvement in Alzheimer's Disease

New Orleans, LA - Dr. Paul Harch, Clinical Professor and Director of Hyperbaric Medicine at LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine, and Dr. Edward Fogarty, Chairman of Radiology at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine, report the first PET scan-documented case of improvement in brain metabolism in Alzheimer's disease in a patient treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). The report, published in the current issue of the peer-reviewed journal Medical Gas Research, is available at http://www. The authors report the case of a 58-year-old female who had experienced five years of cognitive decline, which began accelerating rapidly. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) suggested Alzheimer's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by 18Fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging, which revealed global and typical metabolic deficits in Alzheimer's. The patient underwent a total of 40 HBOT treatments - five days a week over 66 days. Each treatment consisted of 1.15 atmosphere absolute/50 minutes total treatment time. After 21 treatments, the patient reported increased energy and level of activity, better mood and ability to perform daily living activities as well as work crossword puzzles. After 40 treatments, she reported increased memory and concentration, sleep, conversation, appetite, ability to use the computer, more good days (5/7) than bad days, resolved anxiety, and decreased disorientation and frustration. Tremor, deep knee bend, tandem gain, and motor speed were also improved. Repeat 18FDG PET imaging one month post-HBOT showed global 6.5-38% improvement in brain metabolism. "We demonstrated the largest improvement in brain metabolism of any therapy for Alzheimer's disease," notes Dr. Harch. "HBOT in this patient may be the first treatment not only to halt, but temporarily reverse disease progression in Alzheimer's disease." The report also contains video imaging, including unique rotating PET 3D Surface Reconstructions, which allow the lay person to easily see the improvements in brain function. "PET imaging is used around the world as a biomarker in oncology and cardiology to assay responses to therapy," says Dr. Fogarty. "We now have an irrefutable biomarker system that this intervention has promise where no other real hope for recovery of dementia has ever existed before." The physicians report that two months post-HBOT, the patient felt a recurrence in her symptoms. She was retreated over the next 20 months with 56 HBOTs (total 96) at the same dose, supplemental oxygen, and medications with stability of her symptoms and Folstein Mini-Mental Status exam. According to the National Institutes of Health, "Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. Alzheimer's disease is currently ranked as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, but recent estimates indicate that the disorder may rank third, just behind heart disease and cancer, as a cause of death for older people." The authors note that four pathological processes have been identified and primary treatment is with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine, which have been shown to have a positive impact on Alzheimer's disease progression with no significant disease-modifying effects. HBOT is an epigenetic modulation of gene expression and suppression to treat wounds and disease pathophysiology, particularly inflammation. HBOT targets all four of the pathological processes of AD by affecting the microcirculation; mitochondrial dysfunction, and biogenesis; reducing amyloid burden and tau phosphorylation; controlling oxidative stress; and reducing inflammation. The first successful HBOT-treated case of Alzheimer's disease was published in 2001. The present case report is the first patient in a series of 11 HBOT-treated patients with Alzheimer's disease whose symptomatic improvement is documented with 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG PET). "Our results suggest the possibility of treating Alzheimer's disease long-term with HBOT and pharmacotherapy," concludes Harch. ###  LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans educates Louisiana's health care professionals.

# Clemson keeping in touch with Brown

Former AC Flora and Lower Richland standout 6-6 Christian Brown is playing this season for the famed Oak Hill Academy team in Virginia. Brown has received high praise from analysts who have seen him and feel there's been growth in his game and personality. "Playing on a national schedule has helped me tremendously, especially with time management," Brown said. "The schedule is so demanding it helps me even more create a balance for the athletic and academic part of this business. Learning to play and create with other players that are high level has been the most important thing that has helped me with my game." This season Brown is averaging 12.5 points and nearly 5 rebounds per game. He's shooting 54% from the floor and 80% from the line. While Brown has been playing his game on the floor at a high pace, he's kept his recruiting game at a slower pace. He took officials to Clemson, UNLV and Georgia last year but decided not to sign early. The Tigers, Brown said, are keeping things warm with him. "I still speak with Coach (Steve) Smith often," he said. "They are still my hometown team. "NC State, Pitt and Illinois have been very involved with my recruitment recently. Hopefully, once the season slows down I'll be able to take more visits." Brown said he hopes to make his decision before the April signing period rolls around.<end_of_turn>

# Fairfield University, religious charities agree to $60 million settlement for 133 children sexually abused at Haitian school - Hartford Courant

Eight years after Douglas Perlitz was sent to prison for using school, shelter and food to get boys to perform sexual acts, an attorney for the 133 victims said they struck a $60 million settlement with Fairfield University and other religious charities that supported Perlitz’s charity for homeless boys in Haiti while ignoring signs of the widespread abuse.  The homeless boys, some now men, were abused in the late 1990s and early 2000s while living at a school run by Project Pierre Toussaint, a school created by Perlitz, a 1997 graduate of Fairfield University. One lawsuit includes a claim that one of the victims, a minor, was sexually abused by another person involved with the school, but that individual has not been charged criminally.  “This settlement is life changing for my clients. As you know, Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere,” said Mitchell Garabedian, a Boston-based attorney representing the boys. “The victims were homeless without food, without clothing and without medicine... They are sick and have been sick. They are starving for the longest period. This is life changing.”  Garabedian said they have asked a federal judge in Connecticut to consider creating a class-action lawsuit and then approving the settlement fund already agreed upon by the school and charities, including the Order of Malta, Haiti Fund Inc. and the Society of Jesus of New England. The class-action lawsuit would encompass 51 current lawsuits and 82 claims vetted by attorneys, Garabedian said.  Operating through the early 2000s, the charity shifted from a refuge for the destitute boys to a haven for Perlitz’s perversions, some affiliated with the school said during Perlitz’s 2010 sentencing. Perlitz was sentenced to serve 19 1/2 years in federal prison after emotional testimony reflected how instead of caring for the boys, he molested them.  Through lawsuits, attorneys said Fairfield University and multiple charities had influence over Perlitz and Project Pierre Toussaint but failed to stop the abuses known to staff at the school in Cap Haitien.  One worker, Robenson Gedeus, told a judge during Perlitz’s sentencing that he saw boys going in and out of the Fairfield University graduate’s bedroom and he confronted Perlitz, but was simply asked who told him of the abuses.  Gedeus told the court that he never mentioned a name. “The kids would have a real bad time if I told him. The situation in Haiti is very said. There is a lot of poverty there. If somebody is paying for school and food for them, they don’t want to lose that.”  When Perlitz was sentenced, he blamed his actions on what he described was a “dark and abusive” relationship he had with a priest while attending Fairfield University.  Fairifield University officials said Friday that they still did not have any management or oversight of Project Pierre Toussaint created in 1997, but acknowledged the “concluding” settlement in a message to the school community.  “Eleven years later, in 2008, the University learned that Mr. Perlitz had grossly abused his position, sexually assaulting some of the young men in his care. Though some members of our community donated time and resources to the project, Fairfield University played no role in the management or governance of Project Pierre Toussaint. The University was not aware of Mr. Perlitz’s crimes before they were publicly reported. Regardless, our community was shaken by these revelations,” the letter from the chair of the school’s board and the school’s president read.  School officials acknowledged they settled a different series of lawsuits in 2013 that arose from the abuses, but did not say the amount of those settlements. Garabedian said those lawsuits, involving 24 victims, were settled for a total of $12 million.  “In the years following that first settlement, additional individuals came forward with allegations of abuse by Mr. Perlitz,” school officials said.  During a press conference Friday, Garabedian rebuffed the university’s statements that it was unaware and a victim itself. "Nothing can be farther for the truth,” Garabedian said, referencing efforts during the years of litigation in which they fought motions for emergency relief.  The announcement of the $60 million agreement comes among new revelations of settlements made by Catholic organizations in response to child sex abuse. This week, the Archdiocese of Hartford revealed the name of the 48 priests that were accused of sexual abuse or molestiation in which associated settlements cost the diocese more than $50 million.  In October, the Archdiocese of Bridgeport announced it had paid $52 million to settle sexual abuse lawsuits filed against its priests.  Garabedian, who was involved in litigation against the Catholic church, called on Pope Francis to take action in light of abuses by Perlitz and others. He said it is no longer time for discussion but for the church to put programs in place to prevent this from happening.<end_of_turn>

# Roger Stone: Russian collusion? It’s a delusion

Leaks and allegations show intelligence agencies have been politicized: Opposing view USA TODAY's opposing view was originally published on September 18, 2017. Stone, a longtime adviser to President Donald Trump, was arrested early Friday on charges that he had lied to investigators examining Russian interference in the 2016 election. Next Tuesday, I will testify before the House Intelligence Committee in its ongoing investigation into whether Donald Trump, his family, campaign or associates colluded with the Russian government to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. I am testifying voluntarily and have not requested or received a grant of immunity. I have been eager to do so since several members of the committee made allegations in public session that I had advance notice of either the hacking of Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta’s emails or of the content of material published by WikiLeaks that proved embarrassing to the Clinton campaign. FactCheck.org, a non-partisan news organization, reported that those allegations are not established by the record. The torrent of leaks and allegations from our intelligence agencies on the question of Russian collusion demonstrates the extent to which these agencies have been politicized. Repetition of the mantra that “the Russians colluded with the Trump campaign” does not make it true. The New York Times reported in January that intelligence agencies are examining emails, records of financial transactions and intercepted communications as part of an investigation into possible links between Russian officials and former Trump associates, including me.The Times, the Senate and House intelligence committees and our intelligence services have yet to make public any incriminating materials for a simple reason: They do not exist. In addition, the reported meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney who claimed to have documentation of malfeasance by Hillary Clinton was neither improper nor illegal. I believe that the entire allegation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign is the brainchild of Clinton operative John Podesta, most likely to distract from the lucrative business contracts that he and his brother enjoyed with the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin. In short, the claim of Russian collusion with Trump is a politically motivated fairy tale. Roger Stone is a longtime political consultant and adviser to President Trump.<end_of_turn>

# RIM finally releases Pearl 8220 'Kickstart'

Reports are surfacing of the new BlackBerry Kickstart, aka the Pearl 8220, being released in the US, which means a UK launch can't be too far behind. Berryreporter appears to be living up to its name, by reporting the new BlackBerry flip phone, the first of its kind, has been released in the US, two days ahead of the commonly believed schedule. Over the pond T-Mobile USA will be handling the device over the pond, which, as we know, brings Wi-Fi, microSD storage, dual-light sensing displays and the good old SureType keyboard. The UK's official launch date is still 'autumn', so if you're holding your breath you won't have too much longer to wait it seems (though it's unlikely to debut in the next eight minutes, so if you are holding your breath we'd suggest you exhale in case you die.)<end_of_turn>

# Pentagon stands by finding of no conflict of interest in JEDI RFP process

A line in a new court filing by the Department of Defense suggests that it might reopen the investigation into a possible conflict of interest in the JEDI contract RFP process involving a former AWS employee. The story has attracted a great deal of attention in major news publications, including The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, but a Pentagon spokesperson has told TechCrunch that nothing has changed.  In the document, filed with the court on Wednesday, the government’s legal representatives sought to outline its legal arguments in the case. The line that attracted so much attention stated, “Now that Amazon has submitted a proposal, the contracting officer is considering whether Amazon’s re-hiring Mr. Ubhi creates an OCI that cannot be avoided, mitigated, or neutralized.” OCI stands for Organizational Conflict of Interest in DoD lingo.  When asked about this specific passage, Pentagon spokesperson Heather Babb made clear the conflict had been investigated earlier and that Ubhi had recused himself from the process. “During his employment with DDS, Mr. Deap Ubhi recused himself from work related to the JEDI contract. DOD has investigated this issue, and we have determined that Mr. Ubhi complied with all necessary laws and regulations,” Babb told TechCrunch.  She repeated that statement when asked specifically about the language in the DoD’s filing. Ubhi did work at Amazon prior to joining the DoD and returned to work for them after he left.  The Department of Defense’s decade-long, $10 billion JEDI cloud contract process has attracted a lot of attention, and not just for the size of the deal. The Pentagon has said this will be a winner-take-all affair. Oracle and IBM have filed formal complaints and Oracle filed a lawsuit in December alleging, among other things, that there was a conflict of interest by Ubhi, and that they believed the single-vendor approach was designed to favor AWS. The Pentagon has denied these allegations.  The DoD completed the RFP process at the end of October and is expected to choose the winning vendor in April.<end_of_turn>

# Wild claims defenseman Anthony Bitetto off waivers from Predators

Players are in the midst of an eight-day break, but that hasn't stopped Wild management from fussing with the roster.  The team claimed defenseman Anthony Bitetto off waivers from the Predators Friday, its second addition to the blue line this week. After a win over the Golden Knights Monday, the Wild traded for Vegas defenseman Brad Hunt.      Bitetto is another familiar face to General Manager Paul Fenton, who was an assistant general manager with the Predators before joining the Wild before this season. The left-shot, 28-year-old has skated in 18 games this season, chipping in three assists. Overall, through parts of five seasons, Bitetto has two goals and 19 points in 114 career games.  A sixth round pick by the Predators in 2010, Bitetto gives the Wild more depth once it resumes playing next Friday against the Stars in Dallas.  His addition, coupled with the eventual activation of center Eric Fehr off injured reserve, would put the Wild at the 23-man roster limit.<end_of_turn>

# Man dragged scared partner out of play centre by her hair

A man who carried out a violent assault on his partner while she was at a children’s soft play centre in Yeovil dragged her outside by her hair in front of scores of other families.  Samuel James Cabell dragged the victim towards his vehicle and then pushed her, causing her to fall on the hard ground outside Jungle Jungle.  While he shoved her, he shouted: “You have f****d everything up”.  After he drove away leaving her behind she went back inside crying and shaking and was seen removing clumps of hair from her head.  When the defendant was later arrested by police he said he had done nothing wrong claiming he had only argued with his partner because she had annoyed him.  Cabell, 25, of Paddock Walk, Milborne Port, pleaded guilty to assaulting his partner by beating her during the incident at Yeovil on June 9 last year when he appeared before Somerset Magistrates' Court.  Prosecutor Suzie Butler said that on the day in question the victim had been at the children’s activity centre Jungle on Artillery Road with her children when the defendant came inside and started shouting at her.  “He dragged her to the floor, grabbed her by the hair and then dragged her outside to his vehicle,” she said.  “He pushed her causing her to fall to the ground and told her she had f****d everything up, and a witness at the centre became aware of the commotion going on and saw Cabell dragging the woman by her neck and she appeared unwilling to go.  “Someone else saw them in the car park and the victim was on the floor when the defendant got into a van and drove off.  “The woman went back inside the building feeling scared and embarrassed and then started to remove clumps of her hair and was crying and shaking.”  There were red marks on both sides of her neck and she confirmed that Cabell was her partner and then left with her children before the police arrived.  When the defendant was later arrested and interviewed he said he had done nothing wrong and had just argued with his partner because she had annoyed him and “that was it”.  He said he went to Jungle Jungle and was let in by a female and he saw the complainant with her bag. They had a tussle because he thought she had his phone and had taken it to annoy him.  He accepted being verbally aggressive to his partner and said they argued every few days. He also said she previously had a bald patch on her head and had sought medical treatment for it.  Defending solicitor Jonathan Morrisey said that Cabell had an in-built belief that family relationships should be very close, and he was very caring as far as his children were concerned.  “However, there is a clear distinction between his ‘ideal model’ for a close family and the way he behaved on this day,” he said.  “This was quite disgraceful behaviour.”  He said the couple had argued earlier and the victim had taken Cabell’s phone when she knew he had to travel to Kent for work purposes.  He went to Jungle Jungle in order to get it back and the incident occurred.  Mr Morrisey added: “He is sorry for what has happened but he does not have empathy.  “This offence started with him putting his partner into a headlock and moving her towards his vehicle. He cannot remember her falling over but does accept pulling her by her hair.  “The previous evening they had a petty argument and in the midst of that Cabell took his partner’s phone and hid it.  “The following morning he took his phone and started waving it around and then left so he saw the red mist because he was two hours late for a job in Kent.  “There was a small amount of provocation, however, he should have dealt with this in a different way and he is willing to do any courses to help improve his situation. His partner has also offered to do some courses as well.”  Chair of the magistrates, Beverley Higgs, said: “This was a particularly nasty and disgraceful incident at a children’s venue that was unacceptable on every level.”  They sentenced Cabell to a two-year community order with a 15-day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement plus a direction to complete the Building Better Relationships programme with the Probation Service.  They also fined him £480 and ordered him to pay £85 costs and an £85 surcharge.  Want more news?

Beasley Broadcast Group (BBGI) is a radio company located in 15 locations across the United States. It has been publicly traded since 2000, when the company's shares started trading on NASDAQ. The company was founded back in 1961 and today, it operates more some 63 radio stations, which are mostly located in the markets such as Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit, Las Vegas, New Jersey and other cities.  I came across the name while using the stock-screener available on Finviz. On the first look, the company seemed to be cheap. The P/E ratio was around 8.7x, Fwd P/E stood at 5.58x while Price to FCF was around 5.5x and the P/BV was 0.5x. P/BV below 1 is always a red flag. I decided to dig deeper because the company also showed a return on average equity of above 30% and the return on average assets stood above 13%.  Large non-cash items in the Income Statement of BBGI  So turning to the annual financials reported, I wanted to know why a company with such high ROEs, ROAs and high margins over the past couple of years is trading below book.  Source: BBGI's 10-K report for FY2017  On the first look, the Income Statement includes a couple of one off-like items. The company accounted for the Change in fair value of contingent consideration and for the Gain on exchange within the operating profit. If the operating margin is adjusted for these two lines, the margin decreases from above 26% to c. 14% for 2017. The chart below shows the development of the operating and adjusted operating margins.    Source: Author based on company data  The Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration was booked in connection with the acquisition of Greater Media. A number of Common A shares were to be returned to the company based on the proceeds from a sale Greater Media tower assets. The company booked the gain due to the increase of the share price over the accounting period.  According to the company's quarterly filings, the transaction has been already settled and shares with a fair value of USD 6.3 million and USD 4.8 million as of Dec 31, 2017 and Mar 15, 2018, respectively, were returned to the company. An almost USD 4.5 million expense on the change in the FV of contingent consideration was booked in the beginning of 2018.  As for the large Gain on Exchange, more than USD 11 million in non-cash income were booked as BBGI finished the transaction with CBS Radio Stations, Inc., Entercom Boston, LLC, and The Entercom Divestiture Trust. This is a non-cash income which further elevated the operating income and margin. This brings me to the large Gain on Merger booked in 2016 which is a non-cash item as well and the company used it to increase its operating margin to as much as 45.8%. In terms of operating cash flow, the margin has continually decreased from 35.5% in 2013 to 12% in 2017. In the first nine months of 2018, the operating cash flow margin further decreased to 8.7%. This suggests the company is probably trying to artificially increase its operating margins while in the case of cash flows, the company's margins are getting worse over time.    Source: Author based on company data  Intangible assets on the BBGI's Balance Sheet  Coming back to the acquisition of Greater Media, I want to quickly discuss what BBGI paid for and how much. The company offers a nice breakdown of the price in its annual report.  Source: BBGI's 10-K report for FY2017  It is always difficult to value intangibles and in the case of small-cap media companies, they usually take up a large part of their total assets. In the case of BBGI, the FCC broadcasting licenses accounted for 74% of total assets at the end of 2017 and almost 76% in September 2018. If the company finds the licenses to be of lower value than they are currently carrying them on their balance sheet, they will have to write them down. While the company did book a large non-cash gain on the merger, a fellow Seeking Alpha contributor LongInsight found here that there was a difference of USD 76.4 million between the value of FCC licenses reported by BBGI in the table above and what Greater Media was reporting on its books. This further adds to the risks of a potential impairment.  Large debt and declining cash  Another risk factor is the level of debt which has increased due to the acquisition of Greater Media. The interest expense has increased more than 2.7x in 2017 compared to 2016. Given the high increase in the in interest expenses, one has to question whether the company earns enough money to cover the cost. The chart below shows the ratio of Operating income and Adjusted operating income to the interest expense.    Source: Author based on company data  Furthermore, the liquidity of BBGI has not been improving either. At the end of 2015, the company's current and cash ratios stood at 3.4x and 1.38x, respectively, while, as of Sept 30, 2018, the ratios were 2.07x and 0.29x, respectively. Current ratio over 2x seems to be fine but the low cash is worrying. Fortunately for BBGI, there will be no large principal repayments until after 2022. So if the company will be able to improve or maintain its Interest times earned ratios, it should be safe, at least from this point of view.  Source: BBGI's 10-Q report for 3Q2018  What's next?  Below is the income statement of BBGI for the first nine months of 2018 and 2017. Adjusted operating margin, i.e. operating margin adjusted for transaction expenses, change in the FV of contingent consideration, gain on dispositions and the termination of post-retirement benefits plan, decreased to 13.7% in 9M2018 from 14.5% in the same period in 2017 while its revenues grew.  Source: BBGI's 10-Q report for 3Q2018  The operating cash flow margin has continued to decline in the first nine months of 2018 as well, suggesting the FY2018 numbers should look slightly worse than than the numbers reported for FY2017.  According to BIA Advisory Services' article, the current rules for ownership of radio assets are outdated and thus further consolidation in the market is likely. Whether BBGI will engage in further M&A transaction is difficult to predict but with decreasing cash, BBGI would have to take on more debt, interest expense would again increase, along with the risk. It is very likely that the largest players in the radio segment will be setting the trend for the industry and as per the chart below, available in the company's presentation, BBGI is not one of them.  Source: BBGI's presentation  PwC expects the revenues of the radio segment in the United States to record a CAGR of 1.9%. Other segments such as Internet advertising, Internet video and Music are expected to record a CAGR of 9.9%, 9.6%, and 5.6% respectively. Most of the business is thought to be moving away from radio to the Internet, to subscription services offering video, music, etc. and to other segments. This is not to say that BBGI is not innovative and has not invested into digital platforms. What I am worried about is that BBGI is not working a niche market and thus the stronger players will eventually come and threaten the company's business. Is the company well positioned and prepared for this?  Final remarks  The company popped up in my stock screener and looked cheap. A more detailed look, however, reveals the company might be cheap for a reason. First, the operating margins were recently elevated by certain one-offs. Second, the company's efficiency in terms of operating cash flow is declining. Third, BBGI has taken on quite a large debt and has most likely over-paid for the Greater Media assets. Fourth, as the company over-paid for the assets of Greater Media, they will have to be probably impaired in the future. Fifth, the radio business is not a growth story and thus further M&A could shake the market up posing further risks for the company. I am not a fan of BBGI currently.

# 19 killed in twin explosions during Sunday Mass in Philippines church

19 killed in twin explosions during Sunday Mass in Philippines church  Two bombs exploded in a Roman Catholic cathedral on a southern Philippine island where Muslim militants are active, killing at least 19 people during a Sunday Mass, officials said. world Updated: Jan 27, 2019 09:49 IST Two bombs exploded in a Roman Catholic cathedral on a southern Philippine island where Muslim militants are active, killing at least 19 people during a Sunday Mass, officials said. The first bomb went off in or near the Jolo cathedral in the provincial capital, followed by a second blast outside the compound as government forces were responding to the attack, security officials said. Police and military reports said at least 19 people died, including five troops. A number of people were wounded. Jolo island has long been troubled by the presence of Abu Sayyaf militants, who are blacklisted by the United States and the Philippines as a terrorist organisation because of years of bombings, kidnappings and beheadings. No one has immediately claimed responsibility. The attack came nearly a week after minority Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation endorsed a new autonomous region in the southern Philippines in hopes of ending nearly five decades of a separatist rebellion that has left 1,50,000 people dead. Although most of the Muslim areas approved it, voters in Sulu province, where Jolo is located, rejected it. The province is home to a rival rebel faction that’s opposed to the deal as well as the Abu Sayyaf group, which is not part of any peace process. Western governments have welcomed the autonomy pact. They worry that small numbers of Islamic State-linked militants from the Middle East and Southeast Asia could forge an alliance with Filipino insurgents and turn the south into a breeding ground for extremists.

# Plea For New Law After ‘Secret Wedding’ Of 91-Year-Old With Dementia

A 91-year-old woman with dementia and terminal cancer was “secretly” married to a man 20 years her junior, in a case her family says exposes how vulnerable people are being exploited due to a gap in the law. Joan Blass had advanced vascular dementia and terminal cancer, and died in March 2016. Her family were shocked to learn she had married a 68-year-old man just five months earlier. The marriage meant the will she had drawn up years before was voided, and everything automatically went to her new husband – leaving her family with nothing. Blass’s daughter Daphne Franks, 62, claims her mother did not have the mental capacity to choose to marry. She said the reason Blass had never mentioned it to her family was because she would have forgotten it had taken place. When Franks spoke to a member of staff at the General Register Office for England and Wales, which holds records of births, deaths and marriages, she was told the office was dealing with around 16 other similar cases. “I believe our story is just the tip of a huge iceberg,” she told HuffPost UK. Older people are “easy to take advantage of and it is going to become more rife with the ageing population and spiralling rates of dementia,” she added. The family’s local MP, Fabian Hamilton, has submitted a private members’ bill to the House of Commons highlighting the issue and calling for new measures to prevent “predatory marriages” and protect vulnerable people and their families. The bill will have its second reading this week. Franks is hoping to raise awareness of exploitation, and predicts the problem could get worse if it is not directly addressed with fresh legislation. She says she has recently been contacted by a man who claims the man who married her mother has now married another elderly woman – his grandmother. Franks told HuffPost UK: “My mum made a perfectly good will in 2004 when she was of sound mind, leaving everything to myself and my brother. “However, what many people don’t realise is that a marriage will revoke a will, so this secret marriage meant my mum died intestate” – which in effect means she died without making one. Franks added: “I cannot state strongly enough how devastated my mother would have been if she had known the marriage would disinherit her children. She was an incredibly intelligent woman, a university graduate and teacher and devoted to her family.” Franks says one of the most difficult elements of the marriage was the fact her mother’s new husband was granted control of her funeral, despite a legal challenge from the family. “The judge did say it was ‘doubtful’ my mum had the mental capacity to consent to marry, but also said the man was her legal husband and no one had stopped him from marrying her. “The family had to pay the £200,000 costs of the court case – so we lost our inheritance and our savings. If we had known, we would never have gone to court.” Franks claims her mother had wished to be cremated but her new husband buried her in a graveyard, which she says has “no headstone and no flowers”. HuffPost UK tried to contact the husband of Blass, but he was unavailable. However, earlier this year, he described his relationship with her as “loving and caring” and said he felt she did have capacity to marry him. Franks and her family are fighting for a change to the law so that a marriage does not automatically revoke a will. They also want to see an offence of “predatory marriage” created – which is already in existence in Canada – to describe a case where someone is led into marriage without the capacity to consent to it. In the UK this comes under the offence of “forced marriage”, but Franks argues this causes misunderstanding even for professionals, who don’t realise “forced” also applies to those who don’t understand what is going on. She would not have understood what was going on. Demeanour is no guide to mental capacityDaphne Franks Franks, who had power of attorney for her mother, also wants to see checks by registrars before marriage. There is currently no obligation at marriage to check whether there is any kind of registered power of attorney in place. She also wants better training for registrars to look for signs of insufficient mental capacity to marry. Franks said: “My mum had dementia in her medical records and her GP testified she was not fit for marriage. “Even on a good day, my mother could barely say her own name and date of birth. One of the reasons the registrars gave for thinking she had the mental capacity was her demeanour. “But my mum would have been happy and smiling as she was on a nice day out. She would not have understood what was going on. Demeanour is no guide to mental capacity. “No one can believe something like this could happen. It has been devastating for the whole family emotionally and financially.” Gavin Terry, head of policy at the Alzheimer’s Society, told HuffPost UK: “This tragic case underlines the need for better training for registrars to recognise signs that someone does not have the capacity to make their vows. “Sadly people with dementia are at increased risk of financial abuse, so policies that ensure wills are upheld after marriage and that capacity to marry is established are very welcome.” The Alzheimer’s Society says people with dementia are at greater risk of financial abuse. They carried out a survey which found 15% of carers said the person with dementia for whom they care had been a victim of financial abuse. One million people are set to develop dementia by 2021. The main reaction since my speech in parliament has been that of shock from all parts of the political spectrumFabian Hamilton MP Speaking about Blass’s case, Labour MP Hamilton told HuffPost UK: “Since the Ten Minute Rule Bill, it has become clear that Joan Blass’ experience of predatory marriage is not an isolated case. “Several people have written to me expressing their concerns about the fact that once you are married, your will becomes void. “The main reaction since my speech in parliament has been that of shock from all parts of the political spectrum. This is not an isolated incident, but is a cross-party issue with support from across parliament.” Hamilton said he hopes the bill will “get adequate support from the House to progress and if not, at least highlight this very important issue to the government.” A Home Office spokesman said: “The General Registrar Office has provided detailed guidance to registration officers to help them determine whether a person has the mental capacity to marry. “Where it is suspected that a person is not entering into a marriage of their own free will, or lacks the mental capacity to understand the nature of the marriage contract, proceedings will be stopped or deferred until the registration officer is satisfied that the individual has the capacity to make an informed decision to marry. “Where appropriate, the registration officer will contact the Forced Marriage Unit for further guidance.”<end_of_turn>

# National No. 1 Miami Country Day runs away from St. Thomas Aquinas in girls basketball

Miami Country Day, the nation’s top-ranked team, according to the USA Today Super 25 Girls Basketball poll, combined a fast-paced attack with balanced scoring to wear down St. Thomas Aquinas in a 80-62 victory. The first half went back and forth as there were eight lead changes before the Spartans (19-1) used a crucial 7-0 run late in the half to surge ahead 38-33 at halftime. Koi Love, a Vanderbilt commit, and Emani Theodule had 11 points each in the first half for Country Day, while Angelee Rodriguez led Aquinas with 12. “I thought we had a really good first half,” said Aquinas coach Oliver Berens. “I thought we came out with great energy and intensity.” Starting the second half, the Spartans’ constant pressure tired Aquinas (15-5) as Country Day pulled away by opening the third quarter on a 19-2 run, including a pair of 3-pointers by Sydney Shaw.  “They have a very deep team,” said Berens. “They’re able to keep that pressure but also keep fresh bodies in the game.” Country Day led 61-41 after three quarters. The Spartans had four players score in double figures, which included 11 made 3-pointers, including five by Theodule, who finished with a game-high 19 points. Rodriguez and Samara Spencer each finished with a team-high 16 points for the Raiders.<end_of_turn>

# Mother Expects Long Road To Recovery For Young Daughter After Alleged DUI Crash

Mother Expects Long Road To Recovery For Young Daughter After Alleged DUI Crash A little girl is on the mend after suffering bone-crushing injuries. Her mother says their focused on her long road to recovery. Missy Shilling and her husband Drew Schmidt were at home when her daughters' grandmother came knocking. “They told me Samantha was bad off, it was bad. And so, I was freaking out, thinking ‘Am I going to have to plan a funeral?’” said Shilling. Shilling says she was told her two girls had been in a pickup with their father Jonathan Posey, when he crashed after picking one of them up from school. “I did ask him point blank, ‘Were you drunk?’ Because he did have a history of alcoholism. He said no,” said Shilling. One of her daughter's was treated for minor injuries. But other daughter, 4-year-old Samantha Posey or Sammie Sunflower as she likes to be called, was flown to OU Children's, three hours away from home. “We could not get here fast enough. It was god awful long,” said Samantha’s stepfather Drew Schmidt. “He said she’s going to live and that’s what we were holding onto the whole way. She’s going to live, but she’s rough,” said Shilling. Schmidt says they weren't prepared for what that saw. “She has broken her eye sockets, her noise, from here to here is pushed in a half inch,” said Schmidt. Shilling says right now, she's not harboring any hard feelings toward her ex because she needs to focus on her daughter's recovery. But she says if she finds out he was intoxicated, making it his 6th DUI, “Hell will have no fury like mine. There will be hell to pay.” Samantha's family is asking for hand drawn pictures of sunflowers or mermaids to hang in her hospital room.

# John Gibson has rough night, Central Division falls in All-Star Game

John Gibson has rough night, Central Division falls in All-Star Game  Sidney Crosby had two goals and three assists, and Henriq Lundqvist pitched a first-half shutout to lead the Metropolitan Division to a 10-5 victory over the Central Division in the championship round of the NHL All-Star game Saturday night. Selected the MVP, Crosby finished the night with four goals and four assists in two games on the same ice where he won the Conn Smythe Trophy and Stanley Cup three years ago for Pittsburgh. Lundqvist stopped 11 of 13 shots in his two games to give the Metropolitan Division its second title in four years of the three-on-three All-Star format and the $1 million prize shared by the winners of the four-team divisional tournament.  — Anaheim Ducks (@AnaheimDucks) January 27, 2019  Crosby assisted on Barzal’s goal against Devan Dubnyk just 22 seconds into the championship game and then made it 5-0 in the closing seconds of the first half off a pass from Barzal. Crosby also assisted on Pittsburgh teammate Kris Letang‘s goal in the first half and then helped seal the game with a goal in the second half that made it 6-2. Lundqvist made big saves against Landeskog and Claude Giroux in the period one night after winning the save streak competition in the skills challenge. The first time the All-Star game came to San Jose in 1997, hometown favorite Owen Nolan capped the night by calling his shot and pointing to the spot where he completed a hat trick that delighted the Shark Tank.  — Anaheim Ducks (@AnaheimDucks) January 27, 2019  Sharks fans didn’t have as much to cheer for in the return, even though their three All-Stars started the night on the ice together for the Pacific. The Central blitzed the Pacific early for its first win in four years in this format, scoring seven goals on nine shots against John Gibson in the first half of the period in a 10-4 victory. “Anytime you play it’s a rivalry and the fans take it personally. That’s what makes it fun,” Gibson said. “You’re still at All-Star game and you’re out there with some of the best players in the league. Stuff’s going to happen.” Landeskog had a hat trick and an assist and Roman Josi had three assists and a goal for the Central.  — Anaheim Ducks (@AnaheimDucks) January 27, 2019  The Metropolitan Division won the second semifinal 7-4 thanks to a tiebreaking goal by Letang with 3:38 to play. Sebastian Aho added an insurance goal seconds after Braden Holtby stopped John Tavares in close. NOTES: The NHL honored four women’s hockey players who participated in All-Star weekend, Kendall Coyne Schofield and Brianna Decker of the United States, and Rebecca Johnston and Renata Fast of Canada. The four women got a standing ovation and a $25,000 donation in their name to a hockey charity of their choice. Coyne Schofield was the first woman to compete in the skills competition on Friday night, finishing seventh in the fastest skater competition.

# “Handmaids” are protesting at Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing

Sometimes no words are all the words you need to get your point across. Such as it was this morning, when dozens of women dressed in bright red robes and large white head covers silently met Brett Kavanaugh and the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington.  Women dressed in Handmaid’s Tale costumes outside day 1 of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing —> pic.twitter.com/jwaLXmcU3S  — Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) September 4, 2018  — Dan Hausle (@dhausleon7) September 4, 2018 Kavanaugh is Trump’s nominee to join the Supreme Court. He would replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his plans to retire earlier this summer. Now, the nominee will face off with lawmakers about whether he’s fit to fill the vacancy. One of the big questions surrounding Kavanaugh is how he would vote on cases related to Roe vs. Wade. Given that he’s Trump’s nominee, many people on the left are fearful he would vote to weaken or overturn the law. He has only reportedly made one comment about it, supposedly telling a Maine senator that it is “settled law.” Still, many are fearful about his potential presence on the court, and so protestors donned clothes that looked like Margaret Atwood’s characters from The Handmaid’s Tale, a story about women living in a totalitarian society where they are afforded no freedom or agency. We’ll see if lawmakers heed these women’s warnings. You can watch the hearings here.<end_of_turn>

# Can commercial satellites be used for espionage?

For decades, the U.S. has relied on spy satellites to look deep into the territory of American adversaries, and for years, these were the cameras dominating Earth's orbit. Not anymore. As there are now commercial companies putting small satellites in space and allowing customers to purchase panoramic images of Earth. As a result, the U.S. government no longer holds a monopoly on the photos taken from orbit—and has no power to classify commercial images as top secret. One of those companies, Planet Labs, has put about 300 satellites into orbit, enough to image the entire landmass of Earth every day. The company has done it, in part, by reducing the dimension of its satellites. Government satellites are the size of a pickup truck; Planet Labs' are the size of a loaf of bread. The U.S. government sets limits on commercial satellite use and mandates that American companies obtain a license. It also restricts the optical resolution of satellites; commercial cameras are not allowed to zoom down to the same detail as a spy satellite. Still, the resolution comes relatively close. Martin told 60 Minutes Overtime that U.S. military officers could use commercial satellites for 90 percent of the intelligence they need. These new satellites make close monitoring—if not outright espionage—an option, particularly for governments that do not have their own advanced satellite technology. The first spy photos that American satellites took of the former Soviet Union were not as high quality as the photos that Planet Labs is now taking. The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency even uses Planet Labs images to get a more complete look at the world, particularly in places where U.S. spy satellites are not focused. The humanitarian uses for commercial satellite images are numerous. Planet Labs' photographs monitor change, creating before-and-after pictures of environmental transformations, such as deforestation, receding glaciers, and melting ice caps. But there is also plenty of potential for people to use commercial images in nefarious ways. For example, people with access to satellite images could keep a daily record of the number of U.S. Navy ships in port. "If the United States were trying to move an army, as they did in the first Persian Gulf War," Martin said, "move an army without the enemy seeing it, the satellite would see it." Anyone who obtained the images would also see an army on the move. Dictators wanting to cleanse an ethnicity would similarly be able to track movements of refugees, Martin said. How, then, do commercial companies prevent their images from falling into the wrong hands? Will Marshall, a Planet Labs co-founder, told Martin his company hired an ethics officer to monitor this specific question. "We have a process to review every single new client on a case-by-case basis," Marshall said. "Is it in line with our values?" U.S. sanctions prohibit companies like Planet Labs from selling to countries like North Korea or Russia. But, Martin said, that's what front companies are for. "You can, I think, rely on Planet to operate in good faith," Martin said. "Whether or not they can be fooled is another question."

# Louisiana shooting suspect arrested

Louisiana shooting: Police arrest suspect of five killed  US police have arrested a man suspected of killing five people, including his parents, in two separate but related shootings in the state of Louisiana. Dakota Theriot, 21, was caught on Sunday, 1,770km (1,100 miles) away at his grandmother's house in Virginia. Saturday's shootings were in Livingston and Ascension parishes, south of Louisiana state capital Baton Rouge. Authorities said the other victims are a woman thought to be his girlfriend, and her brother and father. Police believe Mr Theriot stole his father's grey and silver Dodge Ram pick-up truck, before driving to shoot his parents, Keith and Elizabeth Theriot. He had a gun with him at the time of his arrest, which authorities say he dropped without confrontation. He faces charges of first-degree murder, illegal use of a weapon and home invasion. What happened on Saturday? Authorities say Dakota Theriot was in a relationship with 20-year-old Summer Ernest, and that Mr Theriot had been staying with her family for several weeks. At around 09:00 local time (15:00 GMT), police were called to a trailer park in Livingston parish, where they found Summer, her father Billy Ernest, 43, and her brother Tanner Ernest, 17, shot and killed in their mobile home. A neighbour told local media two children were in the Ernest home at the time of the shooting, and ran to her home distressed but unharmed. Shortly after, other police officers were called for "domestic incident" in the city of Gonzales, 25 miles (40km) south of Baton Rouge, Ascension Sheriff Bobby Webre said. When they arrived, they found Elizabeth Theriot, 51, shot dead in her bedroom, while her husband Keith, also 51, was still alive. He told the officers that their son, who had recently been told to leave their house and not return, was the gunman. He was taken to a hospital but later died of his injuries. What do we know about Dakota Theriot? After the shootings in Louisiana, Dakota Theriot began the 16-hour drive towards his grandmother's home in Warsaw, Virginia. Police there had been in contact with his grandmother who had feared her grandson would show up. Officers were in the home when Mr Theriot drove up in what was believed to be the stolen truck. He was taken into custody without incident in Richmond County, Virginia, and will be returned to Ascension to face charges. Richmond County Sheriff Stephan Smith told the Advocate newspaper that the suspect appeared tired. "There were some statements made but at this time that's part of the investigation," he said. "My family met him last weekend at a birthday party and didn't get good vibes from him," Crystal DeYoung, Billy Ernest's sister, told the Associated Press news agency. In a Facebook page that appeared to belong to him, there was a repost made in June saying "wish i could clear my mind jus for one day" (sic) with a sad emoji. In May, he posted a message which said: "If you have a problem with me, tell me. Not everyone else."<end_of_turn>

# Vale to maintain royalties payment to Brumadinho after disaster - CFO

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA will maintain royalty payments to the municipality of Brumadinho despite stalled operations at the site after the disaster that killed dozens last week, chief financial officer Luciano Siani said on Monday.

The company also said it will donate 100,000 reais ($26,585.85) to each family that lost a relative in the disaster when a tailings dam burst.

# Shutdown's effect on volunteerism

The shutdown is affecting many beyond those receiving a paycheck. One that I have not read about yet is the volunteerism provided to support federal activities. Normally, volunteer organizations are working now to make plans for the upcoming field season. One is a group of mostly retired former Smokejumpers and associates who call ourselves the TRAMPS – Trails Restoration And Maintenance Project Specialists. By now, we would normally be well on our way coordinating with federal agencies in planning projects for the upcoming season. We have no one to plan and coordinate with and being primarily retired, our volunteers are making summer plans. With fewer projects planned, our members are making plans that will not include spending a week helping restore our nation’s trails and structures. Fred Cooper, Missoula<end_of_turn>

# This intelligent denim jacket strokes your back to help you relax

Dutch fashion designer Pauline van Dongen has been tinkering with ways to incorporate wearable technology into garments in meaningful, useful ways. She sees a future in which clothing takes on lifelike qualities, such as being able to communicate with their wearer–like something out of a fairy tale. As a first step, she’s unveiling an intelligent denim jacket at SXSW at a panel organized by Dutch New Wave. The garment is designed to improve mindfulness by highlighting the connection between our bodies and our minds. She has called the jacket Issho, which means “togetherness,” “same,” and “shared” in Japanese. Conductive yarns in the fabric are activated by interactions between the wearer, the jacket, and external bodies. Issho releases the sensation of a gentle stroke on the back that helps the wearer relax and be mindful of their body throughout the day. “Issho doesn’t offer you instantaneous gratification like the kind fast-fashion products depend on,” she explains in a blog post. “Instead, like a friendship, it becomes more personal and intimate with the passing of time.”<end_of_turn>

# Crystal Palace boss on what he expects from Bakary Sako's return

Manager Roy Hodgson reckons Bakary Sako's return will give his Crystal Palace side a huge boost.  The Mali international was a popular figure during his first spell at Selhurst Park after joining from Wolves back in 2012.  Sako left for West Brom last year, but following a disappointing stay with the Baggies, sealed his move back to South London yesterday.  "We are hoping that he can come back and give us what he gave us then which was a boost in training everyday with his joyful attitude and enthusiasm, and the fact he's so well liked in the group," said Hodgson.  "When he comes on we can rely upon him to do the types of things we are asking him to do with the work rate he was showing at that time.  "I was disappointed we didn't persuade him to stay with us on the contract we were offering because at the time there was a doubt over how the ankle would go.  "He chose not to do that and got picked up eventually by West Brom, and we were just lucky enough to find that there was a chance to get him back.  "He wanted to come, we wanted to take him and it's another very useful addition to our squad because wide areas and forward areas we are still limited to some extent because Connor and Christian we've still got to see how that progresses on a weekly basis.  "We can't be 100 per cent certain that they will be able to do it until the season progresses, and having Bakary there will give us another string to our bow."<end_of_turn>

# Peaches, Nectarines, and Plums Recalled From Major Supermarkets Nationwide

A produce wholesaler has recalled thousands of crates of fresh peaches, nectarines, and plums sold at ALDI, Costco, Walmart, Market Basket, and other supermarkets due to potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday.  The contamination was found during a routine sampling at the packing house, leading Jac. Vandenberg of Yonkers, NY to recall 1,727 cartons of peaches, 1,207 cartons of nectarines, and 365 cartons of plums.  No illnesses have been reported in connection to the contaminated fruit, said the FDA, but customers are encouraged to return the fruit for a full refund if it was purchased at any of the following locations:  Nectarines, peaches, or plums from ALDI in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, or Virginia Nectarines from Costco in California Nectarines or peaches from Fairway Market in New York Peaches from Hannaford in Maine Nectarines or peaches from Market Basket in Massachusetts Nectarines from Walmart in Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, or West Virginia Peaches from Walmart in Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, or West Virginia The peaches and nectarines were sold as a bulk retail produce item from Chile with a PLU sticker number 4044, 3035, or 4378. The peaches, nectarines and plums sold at ALDI were packaged in a two-pound bag with the brand Rio Duero, EAN number 7804650090281, 7804650090298, or 7804650090304. At Costco, the nectarines were packaged in a four-pound plastic container with the brand Rio Duero, EAN number 7804650090212.  Listeria monocytogenes can cause high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea in those infected. The bacteria can be fatal, however, to those with weakened immune systems, and it can cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women.<end_of_turn>

# Men’s hockey: Wisconsin splits goal-heavy weekend Border Battle in Minneapolis

The University of Wisconsin men’s hockey team (9-11-4, 5-5-4 Big Ten) split their two-game series against the University of Minnesota (10-11-4, 7-6-3) this weekend in Minneapolis. Both contests came down to the wire and each was decided by third-period goals, with Minnesota taking the first game and Wisconsin taking the second.  Friday’s game began with a rocky start for Wisconsin, as Minnesota jumped out to a 3–0 lead thanks in large part to their success on power plays. The Badgers have struggled on both sides of power plays all season, scoring on just under 20 percent of their power play opportunities and allowing power-play goals at a 29 percent clip. Their one penalty kill in four chances Friday gave them a steep mountain to climb in order to get back into the game.  Men’s hockey: Badgers hope to gain momentum on road against rival MinnesotaThe University of Wisconsin men’s hockey team (8-10-4, 4-4-4 Big Ten) will look to bounce back after a disappointing weekend Read…  Despite the early hole, the Badgers battled back and found themselves down 5–4 with five minutes remaining in the third period. Multi-point efforts from defensemen K’Andre Miller and forwards Jack Gorniak and Seamus Malone helped guide the team back into game contention.  After the clock hit 5:00 remaining the game, however, the Golden Gophers dominated, scoring four unanswered goals to pull away with a 9–4 victory despite the Badgers outshooting the Gophers 46-28.  Head Coach Tony Granato addressed his team’s late meltdown postgame.  “ … for 55 minutes, we played good hockey, but you can’t play a 55-minute game,” Granato said. “Minnesota is a team where if they see weakness or they see us on our heels, they take advantage of it and that’s what happened.”  Saturday’s affair followed a similar storyline to Friday’s, though it saw a far cleaner effort from the Badgers. This time, the late goal came from Wisconsin captain Peter Tischke to give Wisconsin a 4–3 advantage, which wound up being the game’s final score.  Despite the Badgers committing seven penalties versus the Gophers’ three, UW held strong on penalty kills and was able to end their five-game winless streak.  Notable Badger efforts included multi-point performances from sophomore forward Linus Weissbach and freshmen forward Dominick Mersch, the game-winning goal from Tischke and a 29-save, seven penalty-kill effort from freshmen goalie Daniel Lebedeff.  Men’s basketball: Ethan Happ records second triple-double of season as Wisconsin rolls past Northwestern 62–46Senior center Ethan Happ registered his second triple-double of the season while sophomore guards Brad Davison and D’Mitrik Trice went Read…  Granato praised his team’s ability to bounce back after Friday’s loss.  “… with a young team, you hope the response is the right one,” Granato said. “Fortunately, our leaders and our players were able to put last night behind us, especially the last five minutes. The most impressive thing is you give up three power-play goals last night, and it doesn’t prevent us from staying with it.”  The Badgers now find themselves tied for fifth in the Big Ten — one point behind Michigan and four points behind now third place Minnesota. With ten Big Ten games left on the Badgers’ schedule, the opportunity to rise as the season approaches its conclusion awaits them.  Wisconsin will travel to East Lansing, Michigan next weekend to take on the Michigan State Spartans in a two-game series. Puck drops are scheduled for Friday at 6 p.m. CST and at 4:30 p.m. CST Saturday.<end_of_turn>

# Dear Abby: Man seeking lifelong love finds 'no-strings' sex with ex instead

Advice: You have reached an age at which you know what you are looking for. However, you will never find it as long as you tie yourself to women who don't fit the bill.  DEAR ABBY: What are your thoughts about having a sex-only arrangement with an ex? Most of the women I've dated have contacted me after the relationship was over hoping to have "no-strings-attached" sex on a regular basis. I have always refused because I figured it would make it more difficult to move on and to meet someone new. That said, I'm an attractive guy in my early 30s, and I'd hate to continue to waste my prime sexual years. I'd love to be married and have a family, but I'm struggling to find a woman who is honest, loyal, a good communicator and independent. That leaves me with either having no sex while hoping for a miracle, or a lot of sex with women I don't really like. — SEARCHING IN OREGON DEAR SEARCHING: Dating may look like fun, but at a certain point it becomes serious business. You have reached an age at which you know what you are looking for. However, you will never find it as long as you tie yourself to women who don't fit the bill. This does not mean you must live like a monk, only that you direct your sexual (and emotional) energies forward rather than backward if your goal is marriage and a family.  DEAR ABBY: I'm 16 and unlike most girls I know, I prefer to be natural. I don't shave or wax my body hair. My friends accept this as my business. But my stepsisters, whom I share a room with every other weekend, say I look gross and proudly display their shave and wax jobs. They say their boyfriends and nearly all guys prefer it. I have a boyfriend, but we aren't to that point. However, someday that day will come. Does it really matter to guys if a girl shaves and waxes? Also, how do I deal with my stepsisters? — NATURAL IN THE WEST DEAR NATURAL: Deal with your stepsisters by continuing to ignore their advice and following your own path. The idea that women should be hairless from the eyelids down is one that Madison Avenue and the porn industry have foisted on the public. I can't predict how "guys" will react to you in your natural state, but I can say this: A MAN who cares about you will be only too glad to accept the entire package — fur and all.  DEAR ABBY: I have a close friend who visits me often. Recently I discovered that in addition to eating snacks I put out, he has been sneaking food and things like canned beverages from my home when I'm not looking. He has money. In fact, he is a very generous person. I can't get over his behavior. Is it right that this bothers me, and if so, what should I say? — MISSING MY FOOD IN CALIFORNIA DEAR MISSING: It should bother you, because as petty as it is, it's still theft. What you should say is, "Why are you taking food from my home without asking me first?" It's a legitimate question. If he denies it, your buddy may be a bit of a kleptomaniac. Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips. Contact Dear Abby at www.DearAbby.com or P.O. Box 69440, Los Angeles, CA 90069.<end_of_turn>

# Company plans to build hotel and drive thrus in North Bristol

A property investment company is planning to build a hotel, petrol station and three drive-thrus on land in north Bristol.  Barwood Capital, which owns a 12-acre plot at Central Park - a 600-acre warehouse and distribution development near Severn Beach - has submitted plans to South Gloucestershire Council.  The company has already started developing a logistics warehouse on the site, which will be known as Junction One, and is expected to be completed towards the end of 2019.  It has also submitted plans with Travelodge to build an 81-bedroom hotel on 0.8 acres, while Euro Garages is buying 4.5 acres from the company and is planning to build a petrol station and drive-thrus.  The site is next to the new M49 junction (J1), which is currently under construction.  Andrew Barlow, director at Barwood Capital, said: “We have been pushing forward with our plans to support Central Park’s occupiers and the wider Avonmouth Severnside Enterprise Area.  “The new warehouse will be delivered to a high specification, answering the strong demand from businesses who are looking to expand or locate within this key logistics hub. We are in current discussions with potential occupiers.  “The hotel, petrol filling station and drive-thrus will offer a much-needed local amenity to the park’s occupiers and their staff, in what is becoming one of the UK’s most sought-after logistics locations.”  The proposed new Travelodge will bring the number of the chain's hotels in Bristol and Avonmouth to six, with hotels at Severn View, Cribbs Causeway, Filton, Portishead, and two in Bristol’s city centre.  Steve Tyler, development manager at Travelodge, said: “As part of our continued expansion plans, we identified Central Park as a location for which we expect high demand.  "With its excellent transport links, our new Central Park hotel is set to provide new bedrooms and jobs to the area.”  Barwood Capital bought the site from Delta Properties in July 2018 and Junction One is owned in a 50-50 joint venture with British Airways Pension Trustees.  David Myers, UK development director of Euro Garages Group added: “Central Park is a highly strategic location for our business fronting a new motorway junction.  "We are very excited for EG Group and our brand partners by the potential of this location.”<end_of_turn>

# CJN: Saraki, Young lawyers back Buhari, shun NBA boycott - News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)

The Coalition of Young lawyers under the umbrella of Good Governance Initiative Coalition (GGIC) have shunned the boycott order by the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA).  This is even as the group drummed support for President Muhammadu Buhari in his anti-corruption fight and suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen.  The Convener of GGIC, Barr. Hussaini Saraki disclosed the group’s support for Buhari during a solidarity rally at Unity Fountain, Maitama, Abuja.  Saraki urges lawyers under the umbrella to ignore the two days court boycott as directed by the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA)  He stressed that abiding by the boycott order would be sequel to aligning with suspected highly corrupt citizens working for their selfish gains.  Saraki stressed that the group was of the firm believe that no one was above the law, including the CJN.  The group wondered why the CJN did not do the honourable thing by resigning, since he had already accepted the allegations against him.  They therefore stressed that it was right for the CJN to be aside while the case against him is determined.  “You cannot expect the CJN to chair a committee and judge against himself. Infact it is against the doctrine of natural justice to allow the suspended CJN to be a judge in his own case.  “It would have been more honorable if he had stepped down on his own accord,” the group said.  They called on the National Assembly not do anything that will jeopardize the efforts of President Buhari in the fight against corruption.<end_of_turn>

# Increasing Yields For Grass Seed Crops - PembinaValleyOnline.com

Farmers attending the Manitoba Forage Seed Conference earlier this month learned about ways to increase yields in grass seed crops.  Dr. Nicole Anderson with Oregon State University talked about the role of plant growth regulators in helping to reduce lodging.  "Plant growth regulators are one tool that we can use to shorten the stem, so that the plant can do a better job of supporting that seed head and trying to keep the plant upright during the pollination and fertilization process," she commented.  Dr. Anderson added nitrogen is a big driver of seed number and seed weight for grass seed crops, however it's important not too apply too much, as that will increase the risk of lodging.  She adds applying nitrogen at the right time is also important.<end_of_turn>

# Northlanders working in unbearable heat put on a brave face

It's nice and comfortable to sit in an air conditioned office but spare a thought for Northlanders working in extreme heat.  They are the likes of drycleaners, bakers, glassblowers and insulation installers toiling in temperatures well above those officially recorded by MetService.  At Apparelmaster Whangārei, commercial linen and towel specialists, the heat generated from an iron is 190C and then there is other equipment such as a boiler used to generate heat for the washing machines.  General manager Steve Baker said most of his between 50 and 60 staff were in singlets and shorts and they generally stayed hydrated.  "We've moved the thermometer around over the years to see what sort of heat they work on. It's a good place to work in during winter, not in summer."  However, Baker said most of his staff brought their own drink bottles, they have wet towels, and the company tried to make their uniforms as user-friendly as possible in hot weather.  Baker said although it was hot, it wasn't too bad as the weather tended to be hotter in February and March.  The company takes orders from central Auckland to Houhora and Baker said while overall usage was down at this time of the year, linen use from holiday destinations from Matakana north was up.  Some people who aren't feeling the heat as bad as others, it seems, are rest home residents.  Whangārei-based Radius Potter Home facility manager Mandy Beazley said her staff "try desperately" to get the residents' jumpers and cardigans off as they don't feel the heat.  "As they grow older, their hypothalamus doesn't work. You can't get them off. I cool the dining rooms before they go and they make me turn them off," she said.  The hypothalamus is a small region at the base of the brain which plays a crucial role in many important functions, including releasing hormones and regulating body temperature.  Beazley said resident also hated putting on sunblocks and hats.  "They love the hot weather and for us, it's making sure they are hydrated and the awareness they are out in the shade and how long and things like putting sunscreens and hats on."  Gwen Goodhue, 93, wore a jumper while sitting under a tree and said she put it on as it was cold in the morning.  "Sometimes I feel a bit cold and can sit in the sun with the jumper on whole day," she said.    Tips to beat the heat: Drink plenty of water to keep hydrated Seek shade, a fan or air conditioning Wear a hat and sunscreen Check on the young and elderly. Ensure they stay well hydrated. Don't forget your pets and animals - they need lots of shade and clean drinking water.<end_of_turn>

# Can a boat made of flip-flops stop us using so much plastic?

Three years ago a group of Kenyans on the island of Lamu organised a beach cleanup, collecting more than 30 tonnes of plastic waste. Out of that rubbish was seven tonnes of flip-flops. Those shoes now form part of the Flipflopi, the world’s first dhow (traditional sailing boat) to be made entirely out of discarded plastic.  The rainbow-coloured boat, which was designed by an academic from Northumbria University’s School of Design, set off on its 500km maiden voyage from the Lamu archipelago on 24 January, and is expected to reach Zanzibar, Tanzania on 7 February.  To find the best way to process and shape the material for the dhow, the team drew on academic expertise. Simon Scott-Harden, a senior lecturer in design for industry at Northumbria University, helped process the materials in a way that could be reused and repurposed. “That’s the key message,” says Scott-Harden. “Plastic is great but we need to look after it and work out ways of giving it a second life. We’re desperately keen to show that this is a global problem that everybody in the world should be responsible for.”  The boat was made by a team of Lamu builders, who melted, shaped and carved the plastic exactly as they would with wood. They moulded more than 25 tonnes of melted plastic into parts of the boat, and also used more than 200,000 discarded flip-flops.  “The Flipflopi project has always been about encouraging change in a positive way, making people smile first and then sharing the very simple message that single-use plastics really don’t make sense,” says Flipflopi project founder Ben Morison, a Kenyan travel expert who spent much of his childhood there.  Kenya introduced the world’s toughest plastic bag ban in 2017 but change in habits still takes time, and much of the waste ending up on its shores comes from Asia.  The plastic problem has never been more acute. Plastic has been discovered at the deepest point on Earth and in the stomachs of deep sea creatures. Microplastics have been found in the remote Swiss mountains and in our tap water. The UN estimates by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish, with some 12m tonnes of plastic entering our oceans every year – equivalent to a rubbish truck-full every minute.  “It’s going to take a generation to make a change, but action needs to be taken. And through education, most departments will be on course to teaching some form of environmental issues,” says Scott-Harden.  Academics have been chugging away at the issue for years, notably from the early 90s, when researchers found 60-80% of the waste in the ocean was non-biodegradable plastic. Years later, in 2004, University of Plymouth oceanographer Richard Thompson coined the term “microplastics” to describe the billions of miniscule bits of plastic found in our oceans.  The Flipflopi project is just one of a number of innovative projects raising awareness of the plastic issue, with a growing number of academics becoming involved. Scott-Harden thinks that collaboration is vital to change mindsets. “Projects like this can galvanise cross-faculty partnerships like I’ve not really seen before,” he says.  Over the past few years, researchers at the University of Bath have partnered with Goa Engineering College in India to look at using discarded plastic waste in concrete instead of sand. The research released in December found replacing sand with similarly sized and shaped plastic particles from ground-up plastic bottles produced a mixture almost as strong as conventional concrete, which could help reduce India’s high levels of plastic pollution.  “It is really a viable material for use in some areas of construction that might help us tackle issues of not being able to recycle the plastic and meeting a demand for sand,” researcher John Orr said.  Last summer, University of Exeter research student Emily Duncan took part in an all-female expedition – involving photographers, filmmakers and women from other fields – sailing across the Pacific to learn more about plastic pollution. An expert on the impact of plastics on marine turtles, Duncan was running the science part of the programme, collaborating with researchers in Hawaii and Vancouver – the stops on the first leg.  “I don’t think we’re going to be able to solve this issue using just one group of expertise. We all have a role to play in this issue. That’s why public awareness is increasing, because everyone can do their bit, and to solve the problem we’re going to need to put all of our heads together,” says Duncan.  “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg at the moment about what’s potentially going on. It’s important for research to carry on into all different aspects of it.”<end_of_turn>

# Judge slashes amount Portsmouth councilwoman must pay fired staffer from $775,000 to $150,000

A judge has decided a jury's $775,000 defamation verdict against Portsmouth Councilwoman Elizabeth Psimas was excessive and should be slashed by more than 80 percent. The jury ruled in November that Psimas defamed then-city auditor Jesse Andre Thomas in a television interview not long before the council fired him in 2016. Thomas’ lawyer, Christian Connell, had sought $1.5 million in the suit he filed on behalf of Thomas in 2017. Connell declined to comment this week on the Jan. 17 decision by Norfolk Circuit Judge Mary Jane Hall, who said the the jury’s judgment will be reduced to $150,000 unless Thomas wants a new jury appointed to decide damages. Connell said he chose to file the lawsuit in Norfolk because he didn’t want to have Psimas’ constituents on the jury panel. Neither Psimas nor her lawyer, Alan Rashkind, could be reached this week. She previously declined to comment after the November trial “because it has not yet been concluded,” citing Rashkind’s advice. It’s not clear whether the city is covering Psimas’ legal costs or will pay any judgment. City Attorney Solomon Ashby did not return a phone call this week and also declined to comment in November “given the nature and posture of this matter.” In court records, Connell cited an interview with WAVY-TV reporter Joe Fisher in which Psimas “intended to suggest that Thomas had done nothing since he had been hired as the city auditor.” But by the time that interview happened in March 2016, Thomas had “already been unflatteringly portrayed in many articles criticizing him in The Virginian-Pilot,” Hall wrote in her opinion, quoting 13 pieces about his job performance. Thomas’ attorney told the jury that they were “the only people who can restore his reputation” after the comments made on television, but Hall found he didn’t show sufficient evidence to illustrate the effect that the interview had on Thomas. “His testimony about the effect of the defamation on him was unremarkable,” she wrote, adding that Thomas did not adequately distinguish between the hurt caused by Psimas’ interview and that caused by his firing. He wasn’t entitled to compensation for damages caused by anything but Psimas’ comments, the judge said.  Because most of the damages awarded to Thomas were punitive, Hall concluded that “the verdict was the product of passion or prejudice or some misunderstanding of the facts or the law.” Connell is also representing Thomas in another defamation lawsuit against Councilman Bill Moody for similar comments he made about the auditor. It’s scheduled to go to trial in April. A Pilot reporter has been subpoenaed to testify in the case, but the newspaper is fighting the order. Thomas was ousted by Psimas, Moody and two other council members who voted in favor of terminating him on April 26, 2016. Then-Mayor Kenny Wright and Councilman Mark Whitaker voted against the firing. Thomas was hired in April 2013, and the following three years were tumultuous. The Pilot reported in June 2014 that he had logged into the city’s financial system twice in his first 14 months on the job. When he produced an audit plan, 15 months into his tenure, it resembled documents he had received from the Chesapeake auditor’s staff days before. In his three years employed with the city, Thomas completed two audits and two special projects. But Connell said Psimas’ criticisms were unfair. The lawsuit points out Portsmouth had never hired an auditor before Thomas and that he ran a one-man shop. Connell argued his output was actually comparable to that of auditors in bigger cities like Virginia Beach and Chesapeake, considering they have bigger staffs. In court records, Connell says Psimas “never once contacted Thomas by telephone, email or text regarding any audits or work” in his three years on the job. He accused the councilwoman of tarnishing Thomas’ reputation by making defamatory statements while “lack(ing) reasonable grounds for believing them to be true or act(ing) recklessly in failing to ascertain their truth.”<end_of_turn>

# This super-healthy blended soup takes less than 10 minutes to make

I have owned a Vitamix for two years and, frankly, all I've used it for are smoothies, margaritas and dips. I feel kind of bad saying this, but it's the truth.  I love my food processor, and using the Vitamix felt like I was being disloyal to my favorite workhorse of the kitchen. But there was a point last year when I decided to use the blender more. People love it for a reason, right? It started with blending my eggs before scrambling. (If you want the fluffiest of scrambled eggs, do this). I loved it. Then I made some smoothies for the kids. Yup. That was good, too. My relationship with the Vitamix now felt established, and I wanted more out of it. I focused on ultra-silky blended soup that is heated solely by the machine's friction blending process. It wasn't a new concept by any means, but I thought it was time to try it out.  Blending tips Blended soups in the Vitamix, or any other high-speed blender, are easy and efficient. For the past few months I've been playing around with blended soup recipes, and here are some pointers: Convenience items like bagged baby carrots, cut broccoli and canned beans are great to use: No chopping required. About the fourth or fifth minute of blending is when the machine becomes warm enough to start cooking. This is when I add elements that need to be warmed like garlic, ginger and onions.  A small amount of fresh garlic, onions and ginger can go a long way. These aromatic elements are barely being cooked, thus the overall flavor remains strong.  To make creamy soup, add a tablespoon of butter during the fourth and fifth minute (or when the soup begins to warm). Melt the butter into the soup and then add cream. Stick with one basic flavor to make the soup base, like black beans or carrots. Add one to two more flavors to accentuate the base, like green bell peppers and garlic (for black beans) or fresh ginger for carrots. The fun of blended soup is not the base: The toppings are where the party's at. Carrot and Ginger Blended Soup would feel like baby food without the toppings. It's the fresh green apples, torn basil and salted pistachios that enhance the experience. Crunch and texture are important to blended soups. Be creative and have fun with the combinations. Consider this equation: foundation flavor + aromatic flavor + liquid + toppings (black beans + green bell peppers and garlic + chicken stock + pico de gallo, Mexican crema and tortilla chips)  Making a blended soup is quick — about 10 minutes at the most. Plus it can yield a large batch of soup that can be eaten all week long or frozen for a rainy day. Now, dust off that big blending machine, put it back on the counter (next to the Instant Pot, of course) and get blending. Rebecca White of Plano blogs at apleasantlittlekitchen.com.  Carrot Ginger Blended Soup with Green Apples, Basil and Pistachios 1 1/2 pounds baby carrots 3 cups low-sodium chicken stock 2 small shallots, halved 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 to 3 (1-inch) pieces ginger 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, quartered 2 tablespoons heavy cream Squeeze of fresh lemon juice Lemon zest, for garnish 1 green apple, diced, for garnish 12 basil leaves, torn, for garnish 1/4 cup salted and roasted pistachios, for garnish Place the carrots, stock, shallots and salt into the Vitamix or other high-speed blender. Turn blender on and slowly increase to the highest setting. Blend for 4 to 5 minutes, or until warm. Add the ginger and butter and continue to blend for 1 minute, or until the butter is melted. Add the cream and lemon juice. Continue to blend for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the soup is warm to the touch. Ladle the soup into serving bowls. Top with lemon zest, green apple, basil and pistachios. Makes 10 servings.<end_of_turn>

# TODD GURLEY GEORGIA SUPER BOWL: Sean McVay, Todd Gurley, others talk about coming home to play/coach in Super Bowl LIII

ATLANTA - Several key players and coaches in the 2019 Super Bowl have ties to Atlanta and north Georgia.  Los Angeles Rams Head Coach Sean McVay grew up in Atlanta and went to Marist.  McVay, the youngest head coach in NFL history, has been asked a lot about coaching the Super Bowl in his hometown.  Los Angeles Rams superstar Todd Gurley played his college ball at the University of Georgia.  The star running back told reporters at Super Bowl Opening Night that he "went to the best school in the world."  New England Patriots' offensive lineman David Andrews grew up in Gwinnett County and also went to Georgia.  Andrews, who's playing in his third-consecutive Super Bowl this weekend, got off the team plane Sunday afternoon wearing an Atlanta Braves hat.  © 2019 Cox Media Group.<end_of_turn>

# Beauty and Relaxation at Majorelle

The Californian Hotel debuted on lower State Street in fall 2017 to much fanfare. While its eye-pleasing exteriors are architecturally compatible with the Spanish Revival, for which Santa Barbara is known, the interiors offer something a bit different — tile work and a color scheme inspired by the bright blues found in Moorish cities, such as Marrakesh, Morocco. The two styles are fused well, thanks to the artistic sensibilities of top interior designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard.  The design is particularly dazzling in the hotel’s spa, the Majorelle, where vibrant blue accent tones bounce off pristine white walls like reflections from an azure Mediterranean Sea. It’s an intimate space comprising four treatment rooms, men’s and women’s steam rooms/changing areas, and a courtyard ringing a circular-columned waiting area. The spa has an appetizing menu including aromatherapy, skincare treatments, couples packages, and massages. I recently visited Majorelle and opted for the Relieve Muscle Aches and Pains signature experience — it was in all honesty the best massage I’ve ever had. My masseur, Anders, dug deep into my knotty muscles, breaking up fascia and relieving tight and sore tissue. After the 90-minute session, I emerged in a delightful fog of tranquility.

# South Carolina lawmakers hear sentencing reform testimony

South Carolina lawmakers have heard testimony from supporters and critics of a proposed legislation to reform South Carolina's prison system.  Members of a House subcommittee on Tuesday heard from a former inmate, family members of those incarcerated and victim advocates. The bill calls for automatic release on parole for nonviolent individuals who meet certain conditions and removes mandatory minimum sentences.  While supporters applaud the legislators' efforts to help with inmate reintegration, detractors said the measure ignores crime victims.  Republican Representative Chris Murphy of North Charleston said the current version of the bill has been 10 years in the making and is the product of studies, focus groups, and annual meetings and does not remove rights of victims under the South Carolina Constitution.

# Assam CM orders inquiry into child’s harassment in police ‘security check’

Assam CM orders inquiry into child’s harassment in police ‘security check’  The order came after local television channels showed police personnel removing the black jacket of a small boy who was going to attend the foundation stone laying ceremony of Eri Spun Silk Mill at Borgang in Biswanath district. india Updated: Jan 29, 2019 23:35 IST Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Tuesday ordered an inquiry after police personnel allegedly forced a child to remove his jacket while going to attend a function where he was present. The order came after local television channels showed police personnel removing the black jacket of a small boy who was going to attend the foundation stone laying ceremony of Eri Spun Silk Mill at Borgang in Biswanath district. After the video clip went viral, Sonowal asked Assam Police DGP Kuladhar Saikia to conduct an inquiry into the incident and file a report at the earliest. Sonowal and ministers of the BJP-led government in Assam have been shown black flags at several places across Assam in the past few days by protesters opposed to the Citizenship Amendment Bill. The protests have led police and other security personnel to prevent entry of people wearing black clothes at programmes attended by the chief minister and other ministers.

# DA: Babysitter indicted on 24 counts of child sex abuse

PORTLAND, Ore. (KPTV) — A 33-year-old man who worked as a babysitter faces numerous child sex abuse charges, according to the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office.  Stacy Lee Curtiss was indicted on 10 counts of first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse, 14 counts of second-degree encouraging child sexual abuse, and one count of encouraging the sexual assault of an animal.  Curtiss pleaded not guilty to those charges on Wednesday.  The indictment filed in Multnomah County Court on Friday alleges that between Sept. 2017 and June 2018, Curtiss was “unlawfully and knowingly in possession of and developed, duplicated and/or disseminated multiple visual recordings of sexually explicit conduct involving a child, and disregarded the fact that the images involved child abuse.”  Court documents also state that Curtiss “unlawfully and knowingly, and for the purpose of arousing and satisfying sexual desires, was in possession of a visual recording of a person engaged in sexual conduct with an animal.”  According to court documents, Curtiss said he worked as a nanny until May 2018, and “was a nanny for many, many years.”  Curtiss’ next court date is scheduled for March 12.  The district attorney’s office said detectives with the Portland Police Bureau’s Sex Crimes Unit is continuing the investigation.<end_of_turn>

# What is the polar vortex, and why is it so cold?

Meteorologists have blamed a phenomenon called the polar vortex for the bitter cold that has descended on much of the central and eastern United States this week, forcing residents to huddle indoors, closing schools and businesses and cancelling flights. The cold front was forecast to hit the Midwest especially hard, with wind chill expected to plummet to minus 46C in Chicago by Tuesday evening and 60cm of snow predicted for Wisconsin, according to the National Weather Service. As ominous as the term polar vortex sounds, meteorologists say the phenomenon is not new, nor despite its sound does it refer to a cyclone of cold or a freakishly dangerous storm. “The term ‘polar vortex’ has become more commonly used in the past couple of years but the phenomenon has been around forever,” National Weather Service meteorologist Mark Chenard told Reuters in an interview. There is some debate among scientists about whether polar vortexes have become more frequent and, if so, what effect climate change might be having on them. Chenard said a polar vortex refers to the upper level jet stream that typically circulates around both the North and South Poles, keeping the coldest air there. When that jet stream occasionally weakens and buckles, he said, it disrupts weather patterns — bumping warmer air into Alaska and pushing cold winds down into the US Midwest and East Coast, Chenard said. “This [winter] happens to be a pretty extreme example of some of that cold arctic air making it down to us,” he said. Global warming Though the potentially record-shatteringly low temperatures descending on a large swath of the country may touch off a political debate over global warming, Chenard said, the phenomenon is not related to climate change. President Donald Trump, noting wind chill temperatures in the “beautiful Midwest” are setting records, said in a tweet Monday evening: “What the hell is going on with Global Warming? Please come back fast, we need you!” Jennifer Francis, senior scientist and Arctic expert at the Woods Hole Research Centre in Falmouth, Mass, said that while the latest move in the polar vortex “may unleash claims that global warming is a hoax”, the mass of frigid air over North America is far outweighed by areas elsewhere that are warmer than usual. Francis said modelling studies offer evidence the stratosphere over the Arctic is changing and so disruptions to polar vortexes are increasing. “We are seeing this more often and there are a few studies suggesting that the melting and warming of the Arctic make these [stratospheric] disruptions more likely than they used to be,” she said in a telephone interview. Scientists say higher temperatures in the Arctic have led to historically low levels of ice there. That, in turn, has led changes in the jet stream, causing the polar vortex to buckle. “What we think is going on — and this is a hot topic and by no means settled science — we think there is one area where ice is being lost more than anywhere else in the Barents Sea in Northwest Russia,” Francis said. “For whatever reason, the ice is disappearing there very fast.”<end_of_turn>

# Hope Creek director resigns

EAST MOLINE -- Hope Creek Care Center Executive Director Cassie Baker has resigned. Baker notified Rock Island County Administrator Jim Snider by letter on Tuesday, telling him her last day will be Feb. 15. In her letter, Baker said she will take a "hands-on role" in the transition and training of her replacement. "My decision to resign was finalized after long and careful consideration of all factors," Baker wrote. "I regret leaving the relationships that I have built here along with an amazing, overall hardworking staff. "However, I feel the change will be beneficial to my long-term career goals and objectives." Baker could not be reached for comment. Snider notified county board members of the resignation by email on Tuesday. Snider said Baker was leaving to pursue another opportunity, but Baker's letter does not specify the reason. "You always want to do the best for your employees," Snider said. "(Baker) has another opportunity she wants to move forward with. I respect any employee that desires to move forward in their career. "Obviously we have challenges with the home, and Cassie has been diligent in her responsibilities on focusing on the care of the residents. I've appreciated her efforts." Baker's resignation comes on the heels of the resignations by Hope Creek Advisory Board President Jessey Hullon Jan. 15 and advisory board member Carol Near on Jan. 16. Hullon said he did not know why Baker resigned. "I think it's going to be a loss for Hope Creek," Hullon said. "(Baker) was the administrator; they are going to have to find a new administrator. In lieu of the climate we have there, it will be a challenging task. I'm sure Mr. Snider is up to it. My concern is for the outstanding employees and the residents who count on these folks." Hullon said he had a good working relationship with Baker, who kept him better informed than county board members did. "This will be another issue for the elected officials to put Hope Creek as a top priority," Hullon said. "Beyond finances, now they've lost their leader." The county-owned nursing home, 4343 Kennedy Drive, is currently $4.6 million in debt according to recent reports from auditor April Palmer and treasurer Louisa Ewert. County board members approved a three-month cost benefit analysis of Hope Creek at the Jan. 15 meeting, to be conducted by Management Performance Associates (MPA) of St. Louis at a cost of $29,000. The overview will begin at the end of February and conclude at the end of May. County board member Cecelia O'Brien said she was sorry to hear about Baker's resignation. "She was a breath of fresh air," O'Brien said. "I'm very concerned about that nursing home. I hope they can find a good replacement for Cassie. It's a very good nursing home."<end_of_turn>

# 8 Things Every Design Firm Should Know About Running A Business

Almost eight years ago, I sat down with my partner in crime, Gavin Kelly, and we made one of the best decisions of our lives–we started our own design consultancy, Artefact. We were driven by the not so humble ambition to become the best digital design and innovation company in the world. And we think we are on the right path. But starting, running, and growing your own design company has also been a tremendous learning experience. With every achievement comes a new set of challenges to overcome and lessons to learn. In the spirit of transparency, and with hope that by sharing the lessons we have learned we could save fellow designers some frustration, here are eight insights we’ve gleaned over the years. The design industry is changing rapidly. There is a ton of business out there, but it has gotten a lot more competitive. Always be ready to adapt. The design industry has changed dramatically since we founded Artefact almost eight years ago. In an industry that shifts as much as ours does, you need to be ready to constantly adjust, evaluate and improve along with it. You should know there is no such thing as a steady state. Compared to when we started, there are many more businesses out there doing what we do, with more entering the arena every year. Early on, Artefact competed with the classic design consultancy legacies of companies like Ideo and Frog. Today, many different kinds of competitors have entered into the digital innovation and design thinking fray, from McKinsey Digital to Accenture Digital, not to mention encroachment from the big digital agencies like R/GA. The fact that so many different kinds of companies are now working in this space is testament to the demand for our kind of expertise, but when demand is strong so is the competition. A discussion about starting your own agency would not be complete without a little reality check about how hard it is to set yourself apart these days. Your two biggest assets are your people and your reputation. Quality and creating a best place to work is what drives profitability. The only way to get a great reputation is to do great work. The only thing more important than doing great work is hiring great people. That’s the simple secret of doing business well. It’s a cycle: hire well, do quality work, get recommended and the quality of opportunities (for both work and new hires) will improve. The other part of doing great work is making sure you don’t compromise on quality just because you are young, new to the business or plain hungry. When you start out, make sure you are being hyper vigilant about your values, quality and integrity and avoid bad habits. The first gig you get with a client will be how they cast you forever, so act as if you’re a much more mature company doing exceptional work (and then do that), because that’s the only way you will survive. You can’t design culture. But you can design the conditions for a culture to come into existence and thrive. Culture is a far subtler thing to design than a policy. Culture emerges from the values, policies, and behavior that you and your employees manifest each day. It’s never static and always subject to the tensions and moods of the people in the studio, the clients, and the business climate. As an employer, you have this relationship with people who came to work for you and believe in you. You have to give them reciprocal amounts of trust back to create a place of work where people want to return the next day. At Artefact, we dropped the corporate baggage adopted from previous employers for a much more trusting environment. Everyone gets the same amount of vacation, there is no limit on sick days, and employees can work from home as long as they communicate with the people they are working with. As a result, we work in a much more egalitarian organization. Start as you mean to go on. The first project you do with a client casts the mold forever. Your best clients know your worth and will pay you for good work. You should never work for less than you’re worth and especially never work for free. It not only devalues your work, it devalues our whole discipline. The rare exception to this is when the opportunity is so great, relative to the investment, that you would be crazy not to go for it. But if you go down that path, go all in, and do it to win. These opportunities are often competitive and if you don’t put in the work, your competitors will. This goes back to the point about reputation: the first job you get with a client forever casts the mold for that relationship, so make sure to start out on the right foot. You don’t have to like sales. But you have to do it, and you have to be good at it. A consultancy is as much a design business as it is a relationship business. This is especially true when you first start out, because your first client relationships can determine if you succeed or not. But it really doesn’t change even after you are more established. Even now, 70% to 80% of our work is repeat business as a result of existing connections we have cultivated over time, with the help of great people and a great reputation, of course (see Insight No. 2). The business has two temperatures. Scolding hot and ice cold. When the business is thriving, you’ll wonder if you can grow quickly enough to keep up. In the opposite state, you’ll wonder if you’ve lost your mojo. You have to be resilient enough to keep a steady hand on the business and a balanced response to business conditions. Do not panic. Here are the secret numbers to starting and maintaining your agency: three out of four of your employees should be at least 70% billable in a given year, after adding your profit margin to all your expenses. Don’t let those proportions get out of whack. Use slow times to invest in initiatives that help you grow as an organization or within an industry. At Artefact, we have a big-picture vision for what success looks like and we invest in areas we are passionate about. Initiatives like our internal innovation program Startefact and passion areas like civic engagement and health care help us even out the extremes and maintain an environment of constant development. Your only real power: say no and walk away. Focus on what you believe and what you are great at. You would be surprised at how often saying “no” actually results in a more positive outcome. The honesty generates more respect from your client and the relationships that result are often stronger. It’s true what they say: being principled is a fine thing. Do it for the right reasons. Because there are two exit strategies: death and quitting. In order to build a great consultancy, you need to think long-term. Start an agency because you love the idea of working with great clients on a massive variety of exciting projects and you want some degree of autonomy over your destiny and legacy. If you are starting an agency in an effort to do something else, then you are choosing a risky and roundabout path. Eventually, most agencies fold; some figure out leadership succession plans and a very small fraction (think winning-the-lottery) sell their business to a bigger business and survive the cultural transformation that results. Starting a consulting company is not a get-rich-quick plan or a startup; but when things are running well it’s a great and fulfilling life. Artefact’s other co-founder, Gavin Kelly, and I agree–Artefact is the best thing we’ve ever done in our careers. It has not always been a smooth ride, but we set out to make a company that was world class and that is what we’ve got. I’m around people I respect and want to come to work with every day. I’m inspired by what we can and do accomplish every day. I’m challenged day in and day out to help us realize our full potential. What more could you ask of your career?<end_of_turn>

Hey — the NYPD’s only human.  The NYPD Wednesday offered an extensive play-by-play of the clerical error that allowed a Staten Island sex offender to roam free, while appearing to downplay the significance of the snafu.  Recently paroled ex-con Linden Beaton, 32, is now a “person of interest” in the death of Johynita Jordan, 69, whose body was discovered Sunday. Two days earlier, Beaton was arrested for a brutal Jan. 5 assault of health aide Beatrice Kaliku, 57, who was dragged into a park and pummeled as she walked to a prayer meeting in Clifton.  The 20-day lag in Beaton’s arrest for the grisly Kaliku attack was due in part to an NYPD civilian employee who accidentally marked the case closed — and a police sergeant’s failure catch the error, officials said.  The two employees are expected to be disciplined, said NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan, who added, however, “administrative errors” like these “happens everywhere in life.”  “(It) probably should’ve been caught then but it wasn’t,” Monahan said following a press conference in the Bronx. “Now we’ve got to look what could have been done to shorten that time span, were there any systematic errors, any personnel errors.”  Cops learned about the Kaliku assault the same day it happened, but when the complaint report was typed out, the “closed” box was accidentally checked. The desk officer who reviews the complaints didn’t catch the error, Monahan said.  A day after the assault, the detective squad received the complaint — but didn’t realize the case had been closed before Kaliku was even questioned. The error wasn’t discovered until the precinct’s crime analysis department reviewed the complaint Jan. 8, Monahan said.  “They see, wow, this case shouldn’t be closed, it should be open,” he said. “They reopen the case and send it up to the detectives for investigation.”  The detective squad got the corrected complaint Jan. 10; four days later, they got in contact with Kaliku.  Beaton was identified as a suspect in the attack Jan. 23, and two days after that, he was in custody and facing assault charges.  NYPD detectives are now looking into the possibility that before he was busted, Beaton may have killed Jordan, who went missing Jan. 18.  Cops recovered surveillance footage showing a man who looks like Beaton taking Jordan into an abandoned home on Van Duzer St. — where she was later found dead — and walking out alone, according to police sources.  As of Wednesday, Beaton hadn’t been charged in Jordan’s death, officials said.  The civilian employee and NYPD sergeant who caused the error are expected to receive command disciplines and face a loss of five vacation days, Monahan said.  NYPD Chief of Department Dermot Shea, who was also at the Bronx press conference, said though it still took detectives four days to contact Kaliku after the error was discovered, it “does not mean there weren’t attempts (to reach her).”  “That is something we will be looking at,” he said.  On Tuesday, Police Commissioner James O’Neill promised a full investigation into the paperwork error.<end_of_turn>

# Will Google Glass Ever Look Good?

Google Glass isn’t even widely available for purchase yet, but many have asked: How long will it be before there’s a version that doesn’t make us cringe on sight? A Google+ post by Glass’s lead designer Isabelle Olsson published a few weeks ago could give us a clue. Olsson posted photos of Glass’s marketing manager, Amanda Rosenberg, sporting some inarguably stylish, custom-designed frames Olsson had made for her. Last June, Olsson said the Glass team had collaborations with sunglasses, prescription glasses, and other forms in mind. Although we’ve heard rumors of a partnership between Google and Warby Parker, we have yet to see what that could look like. In the meantime, both fashionable and aesthetically questionable Glass alternatives alike have been rapidly cropping up. From smart, waterproof goggles for swimmers to a budget-friendly $299 pair, check out some of the newest Glass alternatives in our slide show above. [Images: Google]<end_of_turn>

# Super Bowl: Before making guac for your viewing party, the FDA has some advice for you

Avocados are all the rage for taste and health benefits, but nutritionists warn we may be eating too much. Elizabeth Keatinge has more. Buzz60 Eat avocados without washing them? That's an avoca-don't. The Food and Drug Administration is shocking guac lovers by recommending you thoroughly wash the peel, even though no one's going to eat it. Otherwise, you could be toast. It's a way to prevent bacteria and dirt from hitching a ride on your knife from the dark green avocado skin to the light green fleshy part that you eat. To reduce the risk even more, scrub the peel with a produce brush and dry it with a clean or paper towel. Last month, the FDA announced that federal investigators’ sampling found Listeria monocytogenes on the peels of about one in every five avocados. The new data is part of a 2014-16 study, in which investigators tested 361 domestic and imported avocado skins; 64, or 17.73 percent, tested positive. What needs to be on your plate: The ultimate Super Bowl food guide The research also tested for listeria and salmonella inside 1,615 avocados, but less than 1 percent tested positive for either. According to the FDA, the very way people eat avocados — scooping out the inside part out of the soon-to-tossed peel before eating it as well as consuming the avocado very soon after cutting it open — helps reduces the risk of getting a foodborne illness. Listeriosis symptoms include high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths, the FDA said. About 1,600 people get listeriosis each year and approximately 260 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pregnant women, newborns, adults ages 65 or older and people with weak immune systems are most likely to be affected. Retire in comfort: Here's what it costs in every state. What you need to know: New federal income tax form may catch you by surprise. William Hallman, a human ecology professor at Rutgers University, pointed out that likely very little listeria would even be transferred from the skin to the flesh of the avocado but called the FDA suggestion "good advice." "Even though the risk is relatively small, you can reduce it to virtually nonexistent," he said. "There are many more dangerous things you can do than not wash an avocado, but having said that, the rate at which the FDA found listeria on avocados was a fair amount." Angela Doporto Brown eats at least four avocados a week, but she doesn't wash them before putting them on her salads, mashing them into guacamole or spreading them on saltines. "I don’t use the outside," said the 52-year-old Lovington, N.M., resident. But when informed of the FDA suggestion, Brown, a former medical assistant, likened it to surgery, when the incision site on the skin is carefully washed. "It makes sense," she said, adding that she might change her behavior. "I can see myself just for good measure washing the avocados." Food trends come and go, but these are the ones that ruled in 2018. TC Newman has that story for Buzz60. Buzz60 Follow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer<end_of_turn>

# New Orleans' most common hotel and restaurant jobs and what they pay

NOLA.com Tourism supports thousands of jobs in New Orleans, but what do those jobs pay? The question is one of several tackled in a recent report from The Data Center that counts total tourism and tourism-related jobs in the city and takes a closer look at the people who fill them. The report estimates about 15,400 people work directly in tourism, mostly at the city’s hotels. Another 14,800 work in restaurants serving both locals and tourists. While tourism supports jobs at a range of wage levels, the report notes the bulk of the city’s tourism workers hold low-wage jobs. Roughly three-fourths of the city’s hotel workers earn a median wage below $15 an hour. That spikes to 93 percent for restaurant workers. The following list shows the most common hotel and restaurant jobs in New Orleans along with the median wage each pays. This list looks at the city’s top tourism occupations by total employment, or job titles with the highest number of workers employed in hotels and restaurants in New Orleans. The Data Center’s report tracks total employment by occupation from 2012 to 2017 as well as the median wage earned by workers. One thing to keep in mind is that the median wage provided for each occupation reflects the median for all workers in that category in Orleans Parish, not just those working in hotels and restaurants. For example, the overwhelming majority of maids and housekeeping cleaners in New Orleans work at hotels, but some are employed outside the tourism industry. The median wage for New Orleans housekeepers reflects earnings for both sets of workers. Also, the report looks at jobs at full-service restaurants in New Orleans. That does not include fast-food restaurants. Here's a closer look at the stats on New Orleans housekeepers. Total employment -- 2012: 2,456 -- 2017: 2,631 Race/ethnicity of workers -- Black: 68 percent -- White: 15 percent -- Hispanic or Latino: 13 percent -- Asian: 3 percent -- Other: 1 percent Here's a closer look at the stats on New Orleans desk clerks. -- 2012: 927 -- 2017: 988 -- Black: 55 percent -- White: 33 percent -- Hispanic or Latino: 6 percent -- Asian: 4 percent -- Other: 2 percent<end_of_turn>

# Can We Build A Real Golem? These Academics Think So

In Jewish and Czech folklore, the golem is an artificial, human-like creature that’s animated by magic. Now some scientists want to try their best to create a real-life version of the golem. The Beyond Artificial Intelligence conference, to be held at the University of West Bohemia in the Czech Republic this November, is calling on researchers to submit papers on how to best create an “Artificial Golem Intelligence.” Although the official conference subject is Artificial General Intelligence, organizers are happy to explore the relevance for building real-life golems, as seen in the call for papers below. Topics for the conference include possibilities for building cybernetic brains, the use of Kabbalah in artificial intelligence labs, and the uncanny valley. So, the question is… who wants to be the first owner of a real-life magical superhuman giant? [Image: Flickr user One From RM]<end_of_turn>

# Hulu Is Staying Home

21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal, and the Walt Disney Company announced today that they are no longer looking to sell Hulu. Instead, they will inject the streaming video company with a combined $750 million in new funding. After Hulu’s former CEO Jason Kilar and CTO Rich Tom stepped down from their positions in March, its parent companies put the company up for sale. A number of interested parties were rumored to have put in bids for the company, including Yahoo, DirecTV, and Time Warner Cable. “We had meaningful conversations with a number of potential partners and buyers, each with impressive plans and offers to match, but with 21st Century Fox and Disney fully aligned in our collective vision and goals for the business, we decided to continue to empower the Hulu team, in this fashion, to continue the incredible momentum they’ve built over the last few years,” said Chase Carey, president and chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox, in a press release. Hulu had previously been put up for sale in 2011, but the three companies decided to retain ownership back then as well.<end_of_turn>

# Bank heist case transferred to SIU

Police on Wednesday registered a case against the city’s first bank heist of the year and transferred the investigation to the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). An FIR was registered against a security guard, Manzur Mastung, employed at a private bank, who robbed Rs6.5 million and other valuables on Tuesday in DHA Phase 1’s B Market. Police high-ups later transferred the case to the SIU to probe and arrest the suspects. According to police, Mastung first broke open lockers at the branch’s ground floor with the help of his unidentified companions and looted Rs6.5 million, including foreign currency. The robbers then moved towards the mezzanine floor from where they looted valuables, including jewellery and documents, from 10 lockers. In total, they looted 22 lockers. Police said that Manzur, who hails from Rahim Yar Khan, had been serving as the night shift security guard for the past six months and carried out the robbery at 7:30am. According to SSP Investigations Tariq Dharejo, the guard used gas cutters to break open the lockers. He further said that it seemed there were three robbers involved, but nothing could be said exactly until the suspects were arrested.<end_of_turn>

# Tim Cook Wields Apple's App-Store Power: Blocks Google Developers, Gets Personal With Zuckerberg

A day after taking similar action against Facebook, Apple has unleashed developer-hell on Google by pulling important app-development tools from the internet giant for breaking the iPhone-maker's rules.  Bloomberg reports that Google employees can’t access test versions of iPhone apps they’re making, or use internal apps related to transportation scheduling and food, the people said. Security alerts are limited too, one of the people said. They asked not to be identified discussing private matters.   "We’re working with Apple to fix a temporary disruption to some of our corporate iOS apps, which we expect will be resolved soon," a spokeswoman at Alphabet Inc.’s Google said in a statement. Apple restored Facebook’s privileges on Thursday.  This comes less than 24 hours after Facebook’s app development was hobbled in a similar way in a sign that many say suggest Apple is wielding power as operator of the most-lucrative U.S. app store to push its approach to user privacy.  Apple offers an "enterprise certificate" that helps some companies work on iPhone apps without going through the usual app review process. Facebook and Google used this to collect data on user activity for internal research.  Bloomberg notes that when this was reported earlier this week by TechCrunch, both companies stopped the activity. Apple said Facebook had broken its rules and pulled the social-media company’s certificate until Thursday. It’s now punishing Google, too.  And specifically, Google and Facebook rely on the enterprise certificate to test the iPhone versions of the apps they’re making. Without this option, some of the companies’ most important app-development work is disrupted.   “They have no problem flexing their power with us,” Paulo Andrade, a software developer who builds apps for Apple operating systems,said.  “It’s a good sign. It’s Apple drawing the line with these big companies.”  But, there may be more to this sudden show of force by Tim Cook (who has rarely missed an opportunity in the past year to hit Facebook about its privacy issues. As NBC News reports, some observers of the two companies believe the fight has become personal between Zuckerberg, the 34-year-old from New York who founded Facebook, and Cook, 58, an Alabama native who was a largely anonymous tech executive until he took over Apple in 2011.   “The heart of this is ego. These two hate each other,” said Scott Galloway, a New York University marketing professor and author of “The Four,” a book about the dominance of Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google.  At its core, NBC points out that the disagreement speaks to a growing philosophical rift in the tech industry between companies that make money off personal data, and those that do not. Apple is on one side (companies should not exchange privacy for services), while Facebook is on the other ( data-targeted ads are a small price to pay for connecting the world).   “We’ve got one cowboy on the platform side, and another cowboy on the service side, standing off and pointing guns at each other.”  Consumers expect tech companies to get along, said Rene Ritchie, a senior analyst at Mobile Nations, a media company that focuses on the tech industry.   “You count on everybody to be on their best behavior,” he said.  It seems - as times get tougher for Tim Cook that flexes his platform's muscles is they way to demonstrate his company's worth (oh and signal some virtue too) - but as Scott Galloway so eloquently concludes:   “There was Ali-Frazier. Now there’s nerd vs. nerd,” he said.<end_of_turn>

# Abandoned cars targeted by thieves in Guilford County

GUILFORD COUNTY, N.C. -- The Guilford County Sheriff’s Office said that abandoned cars and their license plates are becoming a big target for thieves.  "I think a lot of people are unaware that this crime occurs,” Detective R.D. Seales said. "Their vehicle will break down on the side of the interstate and they will leave it there. Sometimes they'll come back immediately and make repairs. Sometimes for whatever reason it could be a couple of days or weeks or so."  That may not be the best idea. Three cars have already been stolen from the side of the interstate within the past month.  "It's just as simple as them coming in with a flatbed trailer or a tow truck and just loading up the vehicle,” Seales said. “Being on the interstate it's very easy with them being a main artery through the county to be in another county or another state within a couple of hours."  They’ve also receive two reports of missing license plates from vehicles left stranded.  "A lot of times we'll see tags being taken off broken down vehicles and then placed on other vehicles to commit other crimes," Seales said.  Authorities are encouraging you to take your tags off of your car before leaving it. They also ask that you keep all valuables out of sight and make sure the doors are locked.  "Maybe leave a note on your dashboard on how you can be reached. If one of our officers comes out and checks on the vehicle and if we find something suspicious, how we can contact you,” Seales said.  Officials said that the key areas they’ve seen it happen are N.C. 62 and Interstate 85.<end_of_turn>

# Regarding new furniture request, Clinton County Commissioner Woods questions the necessity - Wilmington News Journal

WILMINGTON — If the office furniture in government offices is old, it does not follow it needs to be replaced, said the Clinton County commissioners president in response to a request from the county engineer.  In a letter to commissioners, Clinton County Engineer Jeffrey B. Linkous requests funds to replace a desk and hutch being used by a Clinton County Engineer’s Tax Map employee, and funds for four chairs for members of the public who visit the Tax Map Office.  At the commissioners’ Wednesday session, Clinton County Commissioners President Brenda K. Woods brought up Linkous’ Jan. 25 letter. She said when the Geographic Information System (GIS) Office moved last year to share space with the Tax Map Office, officials said they didn’t need additional or replacement furniture at the Tax Map Office.  Woods also pointed to where the letter states the desk and hutch already were used items when the Tax Map Department got them several years ago, and to where the letter states the chairs are “hand-me-downs from other offices.”  Woods said, “Everyone uses hand-me-downs whether you’re at home or you’re here, and if they’re still productive, then are we just buying it [new item] to be buying it because they’re old or are they not usable?”  On Thursday Linkous told the News Journal the hope is to get a desk and hutch that are more functional than the current ones. And the chairs in question are the ones the public uses while seated at tables, he said.  “The bottom line is they’re [chairs are] old and need to be replaced,” the engineer said.  On Wednesday Woods noted the gallery chairs in the commissioners office — some of which have the former Wilmington College logo on the back — have some age to them. A distinction can be drawn, said Woods, between what’s old and needs replacing, with what’s old and doesn’t need to be replaced.  She also said “every dollar counts” and, at another juncture, advocated “buying what needs to be bought for the right reasons.”  During the discussion, Commissioner Mike McCarty suggested commissioners periodically walk through county-owned buildings to check on furnishings.  GIS moved last year to the Tax Map Office down the courthouse hallway as part of a series of re-locations involving county departments, namely the Board of Elections, the Adult Probation Department, and the Public Defender’s Office. Each of those are getting some new furnishings, at least partly due to moving to a space that’s configured differently than their prior place.  The Tax Map Office had new carpeting installed last year.  No decision was made this week on Linkous’ request.  The Engineer’s Tax Map Office and the GIS Office are designated as units of the Clinton County Engineer’s Office.  Reach Gary Huffenberger at 937-556-5768.<end_of_turn>

# Populist push in Budget before polls: Rs 5 L income exempt from tax, Rs 6,000 cash to small farmers

Making a big populist push in its final budget before elections, the Narendra Modi-government Friday exempted people with an earning of up to Rs 5 lakh from payment of income tax, announced an annual cash dole-out of Rs 6,000 to small farmers and provided a monthly pension of Rs 3,000 to workers in the unorganised sector. Converting what was supposed to be an interim budget or a vote on account into an almost full-fledged budget announcement in the Lok Sabha, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal proposed an array of incentives for both middle-class and farmers, whose disenchantment was said to have cost the BJP dearly in recent assembly elections. Over 3 crore salaried class, pensioners, self-employed and small businesses with total income of up to Rs 5 lakh will save Rs 10,900 in income tax annually after considering the relief Goyal provided in form of a 'rebate'. For those making investments of Rs 1.5 lakh in tax saving instruments, the tax-free income would be Rs 6.5 lakh. The rebate will cost the government Rs 18,500 crore in revenue. He also raised standard deduction by Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 which would translate into a saving of Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 in taxes for those with taxable income of Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh in a year. Also, exemption from deduction of tax at source for interest income earned from deposits in banks and post offices has been increased to Rs 40,000 from current Rs 10,000. This would help all salaried taxpayers who lost out last year due to the removal of medical reimbursement and transport allowance exemptions. As was widely anticipated, Goyal announced an income support scheme for 12 crore small and marginal farmers by providing Rs 6,000 in their bank accounts in three equal installments in a year, which will cost Rs 75,000 crore a year to the government. The eligibility for the scheme, called Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, will be ownership of less than 2 hectares of cultivable land. Though the finance minister said the scheme will be implemented from the current fiscal year, where it will cost Rs 20,000 crore, it wasn't clear how the beneficiaries would be identified. The farm income support scheme will result in the government breaching its 3.3 per cent fiscal deficit target from the current year and slipping on 3.1 per cent target for the next. Fiscal deficit for both the years has been put at 3.4 per cent of the GDP. Wooing farmers, an interest subvention of 2 per cent to those pursuing animal husbandry and fisheries and to farmers hit by natural calamities was announced. An additional 3 per cent interest subvention will be given to farmers for timely repayment of loans. In a boost to housing sector, he announced no notional taxation on second house purchase, raised threshold of TDS on rent from Rs 1.8 lakh to Rs 2.4 lakh and allowed capital gains of up to Rs 2 crore made from sale of immovable property to be invested in two residential houses as against current practice of exempting such income if invested in one house within a year. While defence allocation has been raised by 7 per cent to over Rs 3 lakh crore, subsidy bill has gone up to Rs 2.97 lakh crore from Rs 2.66 lakh crore. Target for revenue from disinvestment of government stake in PSUs has been raised to Rs 90,000 crore from Rs 80,000 crore and dividend from RBI and other banks has been pegged at Rs 82,900 crore. The relief in income tax for the middle class came in form of a rebate. A rebate is different from a general exemption which would have meant income up to Rs 5 lakh for all would have been exempt from taxes and taxes would have to be paid only on income in excess of that. For anyone earning more than Rs 5 lakh annually will continue to pay taxes at the prevailing rates - no tax on first Rs 2.5 lakh, 5 per cent on income between Rs 2.5 and 5 lakh, 20 per cent on income between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh and 30 per cent on earnings of over Rs 10 lakh. Justifying inclusion of tax proposals in an interim budget which normally is only to seek approval of the parliament for spending for an interim period until a new government is sworn in, he said, "Though as per convention, the main tax proposals will be presented in regular budget, small taxpayers especially middle class, salary earners, pensioners and senior citizens need certainty in their minds at the beginning of the year about their taxes." "Therefore, proposals, particularly relating to such class of persons should not wait." 


 Goyal, who was made the interim finance minister after Arun Jaitley had to rush to New York for medical treatment last month, said what he presented was not merely an interim Budget, but a medium of the country's development journey.

# Stools Made From Dead People’s Stuff

A stool is the simplest piece of furniture you can make. I think that’s why designers are so drawn to them: A stool is a tabula rasa, a generic blank slate, with all the structural complexity of a cinder block. Over the past year we’ve written about stools made of ocean refuse, animal bones, and magnetic fragments. Now, a Dutch designer named Joost Gehem has put an uncanny spin on the typology: Gehem makes stools from dead people’s belongings. To be fair, the one-line description of Gehem’s seating collection is a little sensational. In fact, the Eindhoven native uses all kinds of unwanted belongings, some of them coming from the estates of the deceased, others coming from repossessed homes. “135,000 deaths, 32,000 divorces, 10,000 bankruptcies, and thousands of hospitalizations occur each year,” he explains, talking only about the Netherlands. “Many household inventories are left without a home. If heirs and dealers have no interest in the household goods, they usually end up in the local dump.” So Gehem has given them a de facto home. He buys up unwanted items and transports them to his studio (aka the Transformation and Distribution Centre for Abandoned Household Items). Then he stuffs or grinds them down to fill a simple three-legged stool mold, using an industrial machine to apply extreme pressure until they take the form of the mold. “Your old inventory gets a fresh new start,” Gehem adds. “The Centre infuses new life into the cycle of collecting and throwing away.” His first stool came from the 1960s interior of an apartment owned by a couple–the wife had passed away, and the husband was moving to an assisted living home. “Their son sold the complete interior because there was no place to store it,” he explains. “I told him my idea and he liked it.” Because Gehem can sell the resulting stools, he makes a profit–which he uses to fund his next round of purchases. Gehem even accepts commissions for the stools, meaning that if you’ve recently come into some vintage cookware or plastic toys that you aren’t ready to throw away (but can’t use), he’ll make a stool for you. Whether or not it’s respectful to sit on your great-grandpappy’s snuff box collection? That’s a matter of personal taste. “Some people think it’s about recycling or up-cycling,” he adds. “The process comes from some pretty intense life events. Things that happen all over the world. What I find important is that I can relieve the owner of an object in a fitting way and create a new, usable product. [It’s] a life cycle. That’s my first priority.” More on Gehem’s work is here.

SHC directs NAB to look into corruption complaint against mayor  KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to look into a complaint of Federal Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda against Karachi mayor Wasim Akhtar over alleged financial wrongdoings, ARY News reported.  A high court bench headed by Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M Sheikh disposed of a petition filed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader seeking directives for the corruption watchdog to launch a probe against the mayor.  The bench directed the bureau to examine the petitioner’s complaint against Akhtar as per the law.  The minister’s lawyer, however, demanded the court to order an investigation into corruption allegations against the mayor on his client’s complaint.  Turning down his plea, the bench ruled, “We are not giving NAB any order. It should examine the matter as per the law.” “Your client is a federal minister and the federal government can get a probe conducted,” remarked the chief justice.  In his petition, the Karachi-based MNA had expressed concern over mismanagement of funds and alleged corruption in the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).  He stated that the mayor is a public office holder who has been elected by the people of Karachi to look after the affairs concerning the city, including planning, development programmes, coordination, monitoring, and supervision.  The petitioner said he had evidence of Wasim Akhtar misusing powers and public funds entirely for fulfillment of ulterior motives and pleaded that the NAB be directed to conduct fair and impartial inquiry against the mayor.<end_of_turn>

# Keen Shoreham runner to take on Worthing 10k for Lions charity

As runners across the area prepare themselves for the Worthing Half Marathon, one Shoreham man is hoping to go the distance to raise money for charity.  Keen runner David Sluys, 68, will be taking on the challenge in aid of the Lions International Blood Research Appeal (LIBRA). David has been busy training for four months in the build up to the event on Sunday, February 10, and aims to finish the course in two hours or less. Training in the gym and going for walks on the South Downs has made him feel fit and ready for the day. He said: “I hope for good weather on the day as I will be running along the Worthing seafront. This is the first time I have done this and I am approaching 69. “I did a 10k in Brighton just to see if I could and I managed it, so I thought it would be nice to raise some money for charity by doing the half marathon.” After attending a club meeting of Adur East Lions last autumn, David decided to choose LIBRA as his cause. The charity recently launched the Tree of Life fundraising campaign to help create new treatments for blood cancer patients at King’s College Hospital, London. It needs to raise £100,000 for four items of specialist equipment needed for studies into acute myeloid leukaemia, lymphoblastic leukaemia, myeloma and other blood conditions. David said: “It was the club that suggested I run in aid of LIBRA. They are so proactive when it comes to fundraising and I hope to become a member in the not too distant future. I am delighted to run in aid of LIBRA and hope to raise as much sponsorship as possible. “I have witnessed the benefits of new and improved leukaemia treatments first hand. I understand the need for funding so that LIBRA can continue supporting King’s College Hospital’s haematology department and its patients.” So far, David has managed to raise more than £800, but is hoping to reach his goal of £1,000 for the charity.

# 'Bachelor' Sneak Peek: Elyse Expresses 'Doubt,' Storms Out on Women

TV 'The Bachelor' Sneak Peek: Standout Elyse Says She's Doubting 'Everything,' Storms Out on Women (Exclusive) By Jennifer Drysdale‍ 2:03 PM PST, February 1, 2019 Now Playing hh:mm:ss Elyse won over fans after her sweet one-on-one date with Colton Underwood weeks ago on The Bachelor, but now it seems that amazing date might ruin everything. Only ET has an exclusive sneak peek at Monday's episode of the ABC dating show, in which Elyse tearfully confesses she feels "gutted" over her lack of attention since her date with Colton -- and storms out on the other women. "It's been weeks since our one-on-one, and I feel very sh**ty. Right now, I'm gutted, and I didn't think it would be that hard. It's just made me doubt everything," Elyse emotionally reveals in the clip, as she gets herself all dolled up. "It sucks!" The other women, meanwhile, can't help but reveal their concern for Elyse -- an apparent frontrunner -- as she storms out of the house to presumably confront Underwood. "I'm very weirded out as to what's going on," Demi says as the women gather together to discuss Elyse's sudden meltdown. "It's very unlike Elise." "What the f**k? I don't know what's going on with Elyse right now. I don't know where her head's at," Demi continues to the camera. See the full clip in the video player above. We've seen several heartfelt conversations between Elyse and Colton since their date on week two of The Bachelor, but it's very possible that those conversations are the only ones they've had. As Bachelor in Paradise bartender Wells Adams recently told ET, time is precious on the show. "You can't just go and steal somebody. There's kind of a line, and a producer will be like, 'OK, we have to move him' or 'He's an interview now,' so you couldn't go steal him if you wanted to!" Adams revealed. "Then when the time happens, they'll be like, 'OK, he's with someone. You can go now.'""I think everyone's kind of on pins and needles about when the night's going to end and when you're going to have your time, so I get that they are freaking out about the whole thing," he added. The Bachelor airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC -- join ET's Bachelor Nation Facebook group here.

# Ancient fortress reveals how prehistoric civilizations of Central Asia lived

Scientists from Russia and Uzbekistan found a unified fortification system that on the northern border of ancient Bactria. This country existed in the III century BC. The fortress found blocked the border and protected the oases of Bactria from the nomads raids. During the excavations, scientists revealed the fortress citadel, drew up a detailed architectural plan and collected rich archaeological material indicating the construction, life and death of the fortress as a result of the assault.  In the IV century BC, significant part of Central Asia territory belonged to Bactria, which, as a separate satrapy, was part of the Achaemenid Empire. In 329 BC Bactria became part of the Alexander empire and after his death joined the kingdom of Seleucid: the largest Hellenistic state in the East, created by the commander Alexander Seleucius I Nicator and his son Antiochus I Soter. Gradually, the state became weakened by numerous military campaigns and the struggle for power. As a result, once flourishing Bactria ceased to exist in the II century BC when Iranian-speaking nomads from the northern territories, the Saki and Yuadzhi, broke into the country.  Recently, Russian scientists completed excavations in this area and determined the fortress construction time: about 95-90 years of the III century BC, the time of Antiochus I reign and the very beginning of the formation of the Seleucid state. The fortress was inhabited for about 150 years.  It consisted of a diamond-shaped main quadrangle, a triangular citadel (phylacterion), surrounded by powerful double walls with an internal gallery about nine meters wide, and extension walls, which were fortified with 13 rectangular bastions-towers, three of which were also outboards. Outside the fortress there was a marketplace where local residents brought goods needed by the garrison soldiers.  The archaeologists recorded the location of each item using a total station or GPS, and then made it into a single plan tied to the terrain. As a result, the scientists managed to establish where the marketplace was, ran the road to the entrance to the fortress, and determined the place of the assault: there were more than 200 shooting arrowheads, combat darts and troops. It is curious that the proposed battlefield is located to the east of the fortress, which suggests a possible environment or the breakthrough of the enemy through a system of border fortifications.  The warriors who defended Uzundar wore armor: in the inside-wall room of the south-western fortified wall, archaeologists discovered armor-clad plates and two right-handed iron heads from helmets. So far, scientists can not exactly determine what type of helmets these patches were -- a pseudoattical or Melos group, so it is still possible that these are the same helmets that Alexander wore during Antiochus I Soter period.  "This findings are sensational: direct analogies are known from the Takhti-Sanga temple, but there they were bronze, and we found iron fragments in Uzundar. To date, there are only a few specimens and sculptures with which to compare these cheeks and determine their type. We also found fastening details, which gives important information on manufacturing technology, according to tradition, but to answer these questions requires lengthy research," says Nigora Dvurechenskaya, researcher at the Department of Classical Archeology, Head of the Bactrian detachment of the Central Asian Archaeological Expedition.  In addition to weapons, archaeologists have collected a large number of ceramics, as well as a rich numismatic collection: today around the fortress found about 200 coins of very good preservation from the coins of Antiochus I and all the rulers of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom from Diodot to Heliocles of very different denominations: from silver drachmas to copper mites. Such a variety proves that Bactria at the very beginning of Seleucid kingdom formation of the was part of developed monetary circulation system. Thus, the materials of Uzundara allow to study and reconstruct all spheres of life of the Seleucidian and Greco-Bactrian fortresses.  ###<end_of_turn>

# Facebook brings Express Wi-Fi to Ghana, quietly expands Free Basics to Morocco and Laos

More than a year after Facebook commercially launched Express Wi-Fi in five markets, it is ready to bring the connectivity service to the sixth: Ghana.  In partnership with telecom operator Vodafone Ghana, Facebook today launched Express Wi-Fi in the suburban communities of the Western African nation. The service, available locally in Nima, James Town, Kanda, Pig Farm, and Abossey Okine in the capital city Accra, will aim to offer “carrier-grade Wi-Fi” to people living in some remote communities that lack fiber optic cables.  The connectivity service, which is part of an Internet.org initiative, will help bridge the digital divide, said Yolanda Cuba, CEO of Vodafone Ghana. “We are effectively saying to the communities where we cannot deploy fiber that there is a solution that we can give to you and we are giving connectivity at the cheapest rate in Ghana,” she said.  In a televised interview with a local TV channel, Vincent Sowah Odotei, Deputy Minister for Communications, commended Facebook and Vodafone Ghana for their efforts, which he said were in line with the local government’s push to bring more people online.  To launch Express Wi-Fi in a market, Facebook partners with local telecom networks and service providers and offers low-cost sachets of data packs to users in rural regions. In Ghana, these data sachets start at as low as GHC 1 (20 cents). This is in contrast to Free Basics’ marquee service, which offers users unlimited access to a handful of websites.  The announcement today comes months after Facebook unveiled its Express Wi-Fi Technology Partner program. Through the initiative, the company allows access point manufacturers to build Wi-Fi hardware that’s compatible with Express Wi-Fi. “With these new access points, we can enhance people’s experiences, improve service quality, and make it easier for operator partners to set up and manage hotspots,” a company spokesperson told VentureBeat in December.  That’s the only update Facebook has shared on the Express Wi-Fi program since launching the service in five markets (India, Kenya, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Nigeria) in 2017. It remains unclear what kind of headway Facebook has made with Express Wi-Fi in the markets it has made the connectivity service available. A spokesperson declined to share an update on this front. Express Wi-Fi’s India head Munish Seth, who had joined the company from Nokia in 2015, resigned early last year.  Ever since India booted Free Basics in early 2016, Facebook has seemingly grown cautious about its connectivity efforts. The company has stopped updating the social media page and press page of Internet.org. Last year, we learned that Facebook had quietly pulled Internet.org from a handful of emerging markets. In recent months, however, it has quietly expanded Internet.org to two new markets — Morocco (in North Africa) and Laos (in Southeast Asia).  Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.<end_of_turn>

# GIRLS BASKETBALL | Lady Jackets see winning streak come to an end at hands of top-rated Lee High

BATON ROUGE - The Denham Springs Lady Jackets saw their 17-game winning streak come to an end Friday, but not before putting up quite a battle against Lee High, the No. 1 rated team in Division II. Lee grabbed two crucial offensive rebounds off missed free throws in the final 28 seconds and held on to defeat the Lady Jackets, 59-53, in a marquee non-district matchup in front of a raucous crowd at Lee High.  “I felt like we needed to be tested,” said Denham Springs coach Blake Zito, who was upbeat after the game. “I’m not one that says we need to lose one, but we needed to go play somebody. And I don’t think we are going to see anybody in the playoffs as good as them until we reach the (state tournament) Top 28. This is why you schedule big games like this in a hostile environment. This is exactly what we needed.” The Lady Jackets (23-4) trailed by as many as six points in the final quarter but cut the deficit to 55-53 with 37 seconds remaining on a shot in the lane by Desiree Jones. Unable to get a steal on the ensuing Lee (28-2) possession, the Lady Jackets fouled Raegan Williams with 27 seconds left. Williams missed the front end of the one-and-one and a scramble for the rebound led to a tie-ball with the possession arrow favoring the Lady Patriots. DSHS fouled Diamond Hunter, Lee’s leading scorer on the night with 22 points, with 20 seconds to go. Hunter also missed the front end of a one-and-one, but Aniya Lagarde grabbed the offensive rebound and nudged an off-balance put back over the front iron for a 57-53 lead with just 15 seconds remaining. A Lady Jackets turnover on their final possession sealed the game for the home team. “They were upset in the locker room, which they should be,” said Zito. “Nobody wants to lose. But the thing I told them is remember the little things that you maybe could have done. They had two one-and-one situations where they missed the first one and we don’t squeeze the rebound, and that is huge. Instead of being upset, I told them to think about what you can change so that we don’t have this feeling again” DSHS led 15-10 at the end of the first quarter, but Lee outscored the Lady Jackets 20-11 in the second quarter. Hunter, who had missed her first seven 3-point tries of the half, hit a 30-footer at the buzzer to give Lee a 30-26 halftime lead. The Lady Jackets grabbed their final lead of the game with 3:50 to play on a layup by Jones, but Hunter hit a layup to tie the game then a three-pointer to give Lee the lead for good at the 2:40 mark.  Jala Robinson led the Lady Jackets with 17 points. Zito hopes his team can build off the effort heading into the final two district games of the season. “I don’t think this should humble us or refocus us,” he said. “It should excite us in my mind. It should give us confidence to go on and say, ‘look what we can do - play with one of the top teams in the state in their house’ and build on that confidence’. “You want to win on the scoreboard, but the individual battles that we won by just playing tough and not backing down in a hostile environment...there’s a lot of good things we can take from this game.” --------------------------- The News is interested in your feedback!

# Goldman Sachs : 1MDB Scandal Could Hit Pay for Goldman Executives Including David Solomon, Lloyd Blankfein--2nd Update | MarketScreener

By Liz Hoffman Breaking News.... The scandal around a corrupt Malaysian investment fund could cost former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief Lloyd Blankfein's millions of dollars in pay, the bank said Friday. Goldman's board of directors won't -- for now -- pay out deferred bonuses that Mr. Blankfein and two other top executives earned in prior years, and will instead await the outcome of an investigation into Goldman's work for the fund, known as 1MDB, according to a securities filing Friday and a person familiar with the matter. The board also said it reserved the right to claw back 2018 pay from top executives serving as of year end, which would include new Chief Executive David Solomon and his team. Of the $6.5 billion Goldman raised for 1MDB, prosecutors allege $2.7 billion was stolen by a Malaysian financier and two former Goldman bankers. Goldman faces potentially large fines and a reputational black eye -- and has been laying out its case to regulators to avoid criminal charges. Mr. Blankfein, who retired as Goldman's CEO Oct. 1, was paid $20.5 million in 2018, according to Friday's filing. That's down from the $24 million he earned the year before. His successor, David Solomon, earned $23 million last year for three months' work as CEO and nine months as chief operating officer.<end_of_turn>

# Meet The Winners Of “American Idol”

Tuesday night, on part one of the season finale of American Idol, Taio Cruz performed “Positive,” a song co-written by fans online and co-produced by Coca-Cola. It’s part of Coke’s Perfect Harmony campaign, and the soda maker’s in the middle of its 125th anniversary. 
Wednesday night, Ford will present each of the final two contestants, Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery, with a Ford Focus for their favorite teacher–part of the automaker’s Drive One 4 UR School program. Somehow, none of it feels especially icky. To steal another product’s tagline for Ford, Coke, and American Idol: You’ve come a long way, baby. In the 10 seasons since Idol debuted, the Fox show has become a ratings powerhouse and a fertile training ground in nontraditional media-buying for Coca-Cola and Ford, two of the show’s three primary sponsors (AT&T is the third). As the DVR gained ground in the past 10 years and social media and product integration have taken over, Ford and Coca-Cola have used Idol as an incubator for branded content ideas, allowing the companies to create campaigns like the ones you’ll see tonight. From a viewer standpoint, the product placements don’t really stand out. Shilling feels like one of the skills a modern pop star must master, and Ford and Coke are happy to help wannabe Idols correct their pitches. None of this was a given nine years ago, when news of Fox debuting a singing competition summoned memories of Star Search and Solid Gold. It can be hard to recall TV before reality took over, and harder still to think back to when product placement on reality TV was new, a bit unseemly, and undeniably clunky. But try to remember 2002. 
Survivor, then in its second season, was a growing hit on CBS and featured product placements from Mountain Dew and Doritos. Fox was importing Britain’s hit Pop Idol in the form of American Idol, hosted by two unknowns, Brian Dunkleman (what happened to him?) and Ryan Seacrest. When it came on the air, the show’s judges would enter the theater riding in the new Ford Focus–for no reason but shameless (and clunky) pluggery. In addition to providing the cars out of which Randy, Paula, and Simon would awkwardly step, Ford slapped its logo all over the Idol set. “It’s not the easiest thing to correlate with cars,” concedes Crystal Worthem, Brand Content and Alliances Manager for Ford. While Ford had the challenge of figuring out how to make cars suit a singing show, Coca-Cola had it easier: The company put Coke cups on the desk in front of the judges. Voila! “The most fundamental thing we do is provide refreshment,” says Jed Selkowitz, Director of Entertainment Marketing, Coca-Cola North America. “It wasn’t gimmicky, it was truly organic.” Plus, Coke’s rich history with pop music, epitomized by 1970s jingles like “I’d Like to Buy the World a Coke,” which conveyed the product’s core message about hope and sharing uplifting times, sums up what Idol is for families at home. The Coke integration expanded to its cup design program, now running for a few years, in which consumers log onto MyCokeRewards.com and design Coke cups, which they then post on Facebook. The winning design is placed on the judges’ table. “Coca-Cola is an enabler,” says Selkowitz. “We align with the fans to bring them these opportunities and experiences. We approached the producers and Fox with the idea of producing a song. We wanted to partner with an artist who had a positive message. It so happened that Taio Cruz had been already working on this song, ‘Positive,’ which speaks about Coke, but doesn’t. It’s echoing our brand message of being optimistic.” (Despite a chorus that goes, “I’m gonna be positive,” the song is not about HIV.) “We have learned a great deal internally in terms of partnership in general, seeing the value of working in a very authentic way with our partners. Externally we’ve realized you have to take risks, you have to be willing to ride the highs with the lows. Idol, fortunately, has not had many lows. Sticking with the show has paid dividends.” At the end of Season One, Ford found its Idol integration footing with the show’s first Ford commercial/music video, in which the contestants drove a Ford and sang. “That was our ‘A-ha!’ moment,” Worthem says “We thought, that could be a cool way for contestants to display what’s best about them, and for Ford to display what’s best about us.” Ford had hit on a formula that not only showed off its cars, but let the audience see the contestants play dress-up and have their first experiences as pop stars, making real music videos–and endorsing products, a lucrative part of the modern pop star drill. Still, it was hardly high art. Among Season Two’s videos was one in which Ruben Studdard and Clay Aiken sported pimp outfits and stepped out of a Ford Explorer singing Nelly’s “Ride With Me.” “Those music videos were hilarious,” says Worthem. “They were flat and sticky, but we learned a lot from them.” 
Not everyone agrees. Martin Lindstrom, who specializes in neuromarketing, a kind of subconscious transfer of brand messages, believes that Coca-Cola’s relevance to Idol is much higher than Ford’s and that Ford’s placements on the show are not effective. “Most of the product placement we see today does not work,” he insists. “Suddenly seeing a car on stage while people are singing, your brain says, ‘This is ridiculous,’ it has nothing to do with the storyline. So in order for me to concentrate on the storyline, I need to delete that brand, whatever that is.” 
Lindstrom speculates that Ford has stuck with Idol because the company got an incredibly attractive slot early on so “they wouldn’t want to let it go now and let any other brand have it. It also gives them a halo effect to the dealers around the country, which were of course down a few years ago during a tough time.” Worthem, of Ford, says that the partnership has been extremely effective, on many fronts. As the show has progressed, technology has evolved, and the manner in which advertisers get information to consumers has changed. Along the way, Ford has added consumer promotions, sweepstakes for cars, and walk-on roles in videos. “Since then, a million people have asked for more information about Ford on Idol.com,” says Worthem. “Idol viewers go online and interact with the videos, they do the Coke-Idol scavenger hunt, and hopefully that leads them down the sales tunnel.” In 10 seasons, Ford has never stopped doing its videos. By Season Six, they were full-on, MTV-worthy productions; there was a carnival one, and one set in a car wash with Kermit the Frog. “It was awesome! I got to be in a commercial with Kermit the Frog,” says Season Six runner-up Blake Lewis. “I enjoyed doing those commercials more than the show!” The weekly shoots helped the beatboxer learn about production in a way that the rest of the competition did not. And, of course, he learned about pitching products–an essential skill for any musician in the post-sell-out age. But Lewis isn’t terribly impressed with this season’s crop of Ford-Idol videos. “They’re lame and corny,” he says. “I think our year’s were the best.” And yet, the cheesy, hard sell is somehow Idol’s stock in trade. Low points include Season Seven’s Love Guru promotion with Mike Meyers and Jim Carrey’s unfortunate appearance in an elephant costume, promoting Horton Hears a Who. Just last week, Idol featured a forced segment in which director J. J. Abrams stopping by to show the contestants scenes from his upcoming Paramount movie, Super 8, starring Elle Fanning, who shared with Seacrest her 6-year-old cousin’s Idol pick. It could have something to do with the fact that viewers are in the mood to be pitched to–by contestants begging for their votes or soft drinks and automobiles begging for their dollars. “Hey, pop culture is about image and product placement,” says Lewis, who will perform on tonight’s show. “Some of the [other contestants] didn’t like doing the videos. They complained, but then they shouldn’t have been on American Idol.”<end_of_turn>

# Officials: Stop leaving human waste on Florida islands

Florida Department of Environmental Protection is asking kayakers, picnickers and anglers to stop leaving human waste on the dozens of spoil islands in the Indian River Lagoon.  VERO BEACH — State officials say visitors defecating on a group of small islands near Florida's east coast has become a problem. Treasure Coast Newspapers reports that the Florida Department of Environmental Protection is asking kayakers, picnickers and anglers to stop leaving human waste on the dozens of spoil islands in the Indian River Lagoon. Environmental specialist Emily Dark says the islands are made up of sand and limestone, and they lack the proper soil to effectively break down human waste. The waste can create a serious health hazard on the islands' shores and an even bigger problem when rain causes it to drain into the lagoon. The islands don't have trash cans or restrooms, so visitors are responsible for taking away anything they bring to the island. Dark says people should bring landfill-approved human waste bags or a portable toilet.<end_of_turn>

# With Partly Cloudy, Your iPhone Displays The Weather Like A Clock

What will the weather be like in an hour? What about in a day? In most forecasts, you either see the day or the week. But Partly Cloudy, by Berlin creative consultancy Raureif, is an iPhone app that will tell you the weather at any time you’d like, all without ever leaving the metaphor of an analog clock face. “When we first looked at the weather app market, we recognized that there were basically two types of weather apps: apps that are showing high-quality representations of weather conditions with very few facts (mostly as stock video or animations), and apps that offered as much info as possible with high-tech features such as real-time weather radar,” explains Creative Director Timm Kekeritz. “The earlier were appealing for designers, the later ones for meteorologists. We wanted to create an app for both types of users. “As we at Raureif have a lot of experience in information and data visualization, it was pretty clear that our solution would not be based around raindrop animations or simple line graphs and tables.” The compromise was Partly Cloudy, which combines an infographic with a clock face. The user can check the exact temperature, wind speed, and rain forecast at any particular time by dragging the dial to the hour (or day of the week, depending on the selected mode). Meanwhile, a gradient ring ranges from orange to blue, depending on the heat/coolness of the upcoming weather, offering an approximate “is it getting hotter, colder, or staying the same” mood-ring-overview of the general past and future. This approach sounds simple enough, but it’s not 100% intuitive. So when you load the app, Partly Cloudy actually greets you with an annotated tutorial. The general aesthetic is perfectly graspable when spelled out, but the average user will probably need this quick tutorial to decode the app–a point that the studio is totally comfortable with. “The clock is a powerful metaphor that is familiar to almost everyone, so it makes it easy to focus on the content (the weather) without having to understand the infographic first,” Kekeritz explains. He’s at least a bit right: Even if you don’t understand what you’re looking at, there is something innately familiar, inviting even, about the radial clock face. But would I have been patient enough to decode the image without having swiped through the tutorial first? I’m not entirely sure. Yet whether or not you use Partly Cloudy, whether you agree that a clock face is the easiest or most fun way to read the weather, its very existence as what the company calls an “infographic weather companion” holds significance as part of a larger (totally entertaining) trend. Every week, another fairly brilliant design studio redesigns the weather through some $1 app (just check out this one, this one, or this one). And as only so many of these apps can actually sell, I can’t help but wonder if the weather app has become less a commercial strategy than a flag-planting rite of passage. The modern forecast app is “The Aristocrats” joke of the design world, with the weather on a mobile screen serving as a loose framework of improvisation, a means to riff within an effectively unlimited yet topically confining set of parameters. Just don’t let Bob Saget design one. We hear that his weather apps are the dirtiest. [Hat tip: Cool Hunting]<end_of_turn>

# YouTube Direct Enlists Citizen Journalists

YouTube announced Tuesday that it will be making it easier for citizen journalists to submit news and events to established news organizations. YouTube Direct bridges the gap between new (YouTube) and traditional media by empowering consumers with an accessible tool to submit video while providing established media a rich resource for breaking news footage. Although established news organizations have their own new submission tools (CNN’s iReport, ABC’s iCaught, Fox’s uReport and MSNBC’s FirstPerson), YouTube Direct wants to funnel their incredible amount of relevant, user-generated content to these news organizations. YouTube understands the relationship between citizen journalists and established media. It is the role of citizen journalists to capture the breaking news as it happens and established media to follow-up with investigative reporting. Take example from the amateur footage of the landing of US Airways flight 1549 on the Hudson River last January or the dramatic Iranian elections in June. Those scenes were captured by citizen journalists and reporters followed numerous leads to “get the real story.” Your “Joe flipcamera” is not going to interview Sully Sullenberger or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to get further perspective. After the announcement of Direct, YouTube faced harsh criticism from bloggers — raising the question, why not pay the citizen journalists? “News organizations pay their reporters. They pay for photos.”writes the Christian Science Monitor. “They pay freelancers who pitch stories to them. Why should this type of video be treated any differently?” Proponents of Direct tout the move as a way to gain broader exposure for citizen journalists. In some cases, amateurs are paid handsomely for their content (think 9/11 footage); however, with an event like the Iranian elections, citizens are recording for the greater good, not a pay check. News organizations do not have the resources to have camera crews on-site for every event. They must rely on citizen journalists like those in Iran and NYC to capture live footage. It is then their task to analyze and solicit the news across TV and the web. Established media are facing stiff competition from video sharing sites, such as… To read more about YouTube Direct, go to Sparxoo, a digital marketing, branding and business development blog.<end_of_turn>

# Bing to Lap Google in Making Search an App?

If Google is the Alpha dog of search, Bing is often described as the young pup yapping at its heels. But look closely and you’ll see that Bing, in some ways, is actually leap-frogging Google and leading the race in redefining what search is about. (Okay, we’re done with the animal metaphors, swear.) The new features Bing unveiled in San Francisco yesterday move even further in that direction and may help Microsoft in its quest to capture a larger share of the search market. Among the features announced: When you search for a restaurant, you can call up a landing-type page in Bing that aggregates everything you’d want to know about that particular establishment: reviews, photos, maps, hours, even things to do nearby, a la Citysearch. All of this information is culled from other sites and organized on a single, easy-to-use page within the search engine. If you want to read a complete review, you can click through to the site it came from, but if you simply want to skim, you have the key information right there within Bing. And if you decide that’s the joint for you, functionality from OpenTable is embedded on the page, allowing you to make a reservation without ever leaving the search engine. The idea behind features like this, say Bing executives, is that search is no longer simply about looking for information. It’s about getting things done: Booking reservations, buying plane tickets, researching consumer products. And Microsoft is trying to help its users get those things done as quickly as possible. It’s trying, simply put, to make search results less like a list of links and more like an app. “We want to make search that next-generation organizing layer that helps you with task completion,” senior vice president for research and development of online services, Satya Nadella told Fast Company. Other features announced yesterday that reflect this “app-ification” of search include similar landing-type pages for entertainment options. If a movie’s still in theaters, for example, you can order tickets right from Bing. For movies on DVD, Bing will tell you whether Netflix or iTunes has the title available and let you click on through to start watching immediately. Functionality from Bing partner FanSnap lets you compare ticket prices to sporting events from over 50 sites, as well as identify the location of your seat on a seating chart, and even see what the view will look like from there. And destination pages for certain cities serve up pictures and videos, list attractions and upcoming events, and even let you search for flights right from Bing. The “app-ification” also includes smaller elements that Bing calls “Answers,” which are embedded within what otherwise looks like a conventional page of results. If you search for “Golden Globes,” for example, at the top of the results page there’s a condensed section that lets you know when the Globes will take place and gives you quick links to previous winners, highlights, and red carpet fashions. These aren’t necessarily the most “relevant” links, as Google might serve up. It’s more of an editorial touch, aggregating what the system thinks you might actually like to know about the topic. Bing partner group program manager Derrick Connell said Bing released between 50 to 60 of these “Answers” elements as part of yesterday’s announcement. Bing’s approach is a far cry from the search paradigm pioneered by Google. In the deep dark ages of the Internet, like, 10 years ago, the web was mostly a collection of documents. And people using the web simply wanted to find the document–the site with the most relevant information. Search emerged as a tool to locate sites, and Google’s innovation–to identify the most “relevant” sites–made it the market leader. Fast forward to 2010. The Internet is now a core productivity tool. People use it to perform all sorts of tasks. And yet the design of search engines, for the most part, has remained entrenched in the idea that the user is looking for a page, rather than an accomplishment. Search, say the folks at Bing, needs to catch up to this new model. To that end, Microsoft has identified about 160 “tasks” it believes people are actually trying to accomplish when they use search–tasks like plan trips, comparison shop, buy tickets. At yesterday’s rollout, executives said Bing has developed functionality for about 40 of those tasks so far, and it’ll keep chipping away at them one-by-one. “Search started out as a site-finding tool for the topical Web,” Nadella said. “Now search needs to help people with what they are actually trying to do when they’re finding a site.” Bing’s insight that search needed a paradigm shift came about three years ago when Microsoft’s previous search product was limping along, far behind Google. Users weren’t giving Microsoft a shot, spokesman Stefan Weitz told Fast Company, and engineers wanted to know why. So they started poring through search logs, user data, and research studies. “We started seeing these patterns,” Weitz said. “Search queries were traditionally thought of to be: query to result to page. But in actuality what we were seeing were these long chains. People would start on Monday with a query on Lake Tahoe. Then they’d add a refinement: ‘Lake Tahoe rental.’ Then ‘Lake Tahoe rental family.’ Then ‘Lake Tahoe rental for 6.’ These constant modifications would happen over the course of a month, in some cases. That told us that people were using this search product in a way it wasn’t designed. [That told us] there’s a task model there.” Advances in technology have made it possible for Bing to effect the shift to the new model. The proliferation of APIs (application programming interfaces) means that Microsoft can import data and tools from other sites and services into Bing–like the OpenTable reservation system–in ways not previously possible. The fact that more and more websites are “structuring” the data on their pages means that a Bing robot can read a page and tell, for example, that a recipe is a recipe rather than an undifferentiated mass of text. And new developments in geospatial tools as well as the introduction of social networks are giving Bing more dimensions to work with. Google, of course, is also moving toward “app-ification.” The search giant long ago allowed users to perform calculations right inside the search box, for example, and it innovated the idea of displaying elements like the local time of a far away city , the map of a destination, or movie schedules in search results rather than making users click to another website. In more recent years, Google has pioneered the app-ification of shopping searches, letting you compare products and prices right within its results pages. But Bing has moved ahead of Google, tackling this approach more comprehensively and for more tasks. Whether that will lead to more profits for Microsoft remains to be seen. The latest numbers from Hitwise show Google holding on to 71% of search traffic, while Bing only has 10%. But according to Bing, the site has grown 48% since it was launched 19 months ago, and now has 90 million users. In the near term, many searchers will likely continue to use Google, out of habit in some cases and, in others, because they genuinely prefer it. But in an age when consumers like the idea of having apps that execute discrete functions and serve up utilitarian results quickly and easily, those who try Bing may find that, for certain tasks, it’s the search engine to beat.

# How Much Would You Pay for a Celebrity Retweet?

This week, you have the chance to become friends with celebrities. Alicia Keys, Kim Kardashian, Snoop Dogg–they’re all ready to befriend you and build a relationship. On Twitter, that is. For the rest of the week, eBay is hosting charity auction TwitChange, the first ever celebrity tweet auction, which is raising money for aHomeInHaiti.org. We’re all for lending a hand to Haiti, but selling off Twitter connections is not necessarily the best way to do it. Getting non-celebrity followers is pretty cheap. Elsewhere on eBay, you can “buy” followers for under a penny each. Want to stroke your ego with 5,000 followers? That’ll cost you just $20–about a quarter of a penny per follower. Marketing companies such as uSocial and Hype140 are offering followers by the thousands–100,000 for $3,479 or 50,000 for $500. In other words, it’s inexpensive to inflate your follower counts–tweets are cheap. Of course, TwitChange isn’t just hawking any old followers, and there must be some value to having celebrity Twitter friends. Currently, actor Zachary Levi and UFC aficionado Dan White are topping eBay’s charts. Hundreds of people have bid about $15,000 for the privilege of their Twitter Mega Packages. What’s included? Right now, “Ryan Seacrest will follow you on Twitter for a minimum of 90 days, will retweet one of your tweets and will send out a tweet including your @twitterhandle.” Cost: $1,525. And you can bet on day 91 Seacrest will immediately unfollow you. Even just a retweet–the painless process of re-posting someone else’s tweet–is raising TwitChange cash. Bids so far range from around $40 (George Lopez) to around $70 (Kevin Jonas). Well over 150 Twitter celebs are up for auction, including the Kardashian sisters, Felicia Day, Alyssa Milano, Rainn Wilson, and many more who have topped the charts of influential celebrities on Twitter, based on click-through rates. That sphere of influence may well bring more attention to aHomeInHaiti than the money TwitChange actually raises. And just wait until Justin Bieber turns up the heat.<end_of_turn>

# RECAP: Siewert and Sarri reflect on Town's heavy defeat at Chelsea

Huddersfield Town were beaten 5-0 by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge this afternoon.  The Terriers were outclassed by Maurizio Sarri's men, who bounced back from their 4-0 defeat at AFC Bournemouth in midweek with a dominant performance in west London.  Eden Hazard ran the show for the 2016/17 Premier League champions, with the Belgian winger netting a brace along with Juventus loanee Gonzalo Higuain, who bagged his first goals for Chelsea.  David Luiz also got on the sccoresheet in the dying minutes with a bullet header following a corner, capping off a miserable afternoon in the capital for the Terriers.  Here we'll have all the updates from the post-match press conference as Jan Siewert and opposite number Sarri reflect on the heavy defeat in London. That's all That’s everything from the Town boss and that brings today’s press conference to an end. Karlan Grant Karlan needs time in terms of physicality. He has to get used to my game. He has shown already why we signed him, but this game was a bit too early to start him. Aggressive We have to be much more aggressive in willing to score. Sometimes we miss the opportunity to shoot. Expected All the Chelsea players went away and no one expected it. But the result is the result. Chelsea penalty It was definitely a bad moment for us. We had some good moments in the first half. I will not judge the penalty because I don’t think it was one. Risks We are at the bottom of the table and we have to try and win every game. Our will was to win here, but today we have zero points so I am not happy. Not well I don’t feel well at the minute and neither do the players. The first shot from Aaron Mooy showed we were willing to win the game, but we cannot be compared to Chelsea at the moment. Jan Siewert Here is the Town head coach. That's all from Sarri  That’s everything from the Chelsea boss. Next up is Jan Siewert. Potential We have good potential. We need to play 70/75 minutes like the first 25 in this match. Emotions I was completely focused on the team over the last three or four days. I wanted to understand. Today what I saw was very good, but we have to be careful because we need the same mentality in every match. When you play every three days it is not easy - on Wednesday a lot of teams were in trouble. Motivation We need to understand that in the future we will not have to lose a game for motivation. We need to improve in this consistency and mentality. Gonzalo Higuain I know when he arrived he was not at the top of his physical condition. Now he is improving. I am very happy because, apart from the goals, he is very suited to play close to Eden Hazard. Chelsea's season At the moment, we have to be happy about our season. We are in February and we are involved in four different competitions. We have to fight if we want to stay in the top four and then we have to try and win something. It will be difficult. Good start We started very, very well. In the first 25 minutes I saw my football. We moved the ball very fast. We were very dangerous every two minutes. Maurizio Sarri Here is the Chelsea boss. Welcome Hello and welcome to our post-match live blog from Stamford Bridge. Here we’ll bring you all the thoughts of Jan Siewert and Maurizio Sarri as the pair reflect on today’s 5-0 defeat in west London.<end_of_turn>

# User Growth First, Revenue Second? – Learning From Facebook, YouTube and Twitter

This cartoon summarises the concept very well – The Online Business Model To Get VC Money Web ventures backed by VCs are notorious for focusing predominantly on acquiring users first and leaving revenue on the back burner during the early stages. The perfect examples are YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. TechCrunch reported today that Facebook Is Not Only The World’s Largest Social Network, It Is Also The Fastest Growing – of course not mentioning revenue since the article was not about that. Their team deserves tremendous credit for what they have achieved. However, 99% of entrepreneurs can’t go about building their business this way because they don’t have millions of dollars from VCs to burn through while they figure out a way to actually make money. YouTube is still having trouble monetizing their audience and few entrepreneurs ever get that kind of big payout like Chad Hurley and Steve Chen. Repeating what they did is possible, but extremely unlikely (except during a bubble of course). Twitter did not have a business model when it launched and still doesn’t have one, but it is growing amazingly quick and I am confident they will find a model (well maybe with Summize they now have one). They have been able to do this because they have raised over US$20 million from VCs – without a business model and a clear plan to generate cash flow. The only sad part of this is that other entrepreneurs look at these case studies and try to do the same with their startups, except that they take out loans and use their credit cards. It is virtually impossible to use the YouTube/Facebook/Twitter model without VC money and succeed. You most likely will end up with tons of debt – I am speaking from personal experience and still have the debt to prove it 🙂 Normal entrepreneurs must focus on generating revenue because cash flow is the life blood of a business, especially a startup. Study these ventures and learn from them, but understand what you can and can’t adapt, otherwise you are setting yourself up for failure and some serious debt (we are sitting on around US$65,000 from the first failure when we were busy chasing users and VCs). 
Bottom Line: 
Have a cash flow plan early on so that as you add customers/users, your cash flow improves – you might just not need those VCs in the end.<end_of_turn>

# Patriots shut out top-two offenses in first half

The Patriots defense now has shutout the NFL’s top-two offenses in the first half of their past two games.  They blanked the Chiefs 14-0 in the first half of the AFC Championship Game before winning 37-31. The Chiefs had three first downs and 32 total yards in the first 30 minutes.  The Patriots lead the Rams 3-0 at halftime of Super Bowl LIII.  The Rams have two first downs and 57 yards. They have punted six times.  The Patriots also have two sacks of Jared Goff.  Now, who makes the best halftime adjustment?<end_of_turn>

# How do you Innovate Your Way out of a Rut in Customer Service?

It’s easier than ever to find out what consumers are talking about when it comes to your company or type of business today. Log online and run a Google Search, or a Twitter search – better yet, program Google Alerts with your company name or the name of your products and voila’. Not only that, but it is even easier to offer help proactively. When using social media tools such as Twitter, you have the ability to listen to conversations and connect with your customers with an immediacy you may not even had at the corner store. Twitter is a service for friends, family, and co–workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent answers and messages. If you want to learn what anyone is saying about a specific company on Twitter, start here. Enter “Skype customer service,” for example and you will find what everyone is saying about the company in real time. It looks like the company is having a hard time delivering good service. what would you do if you were them? Since it is so easy t find out what your customers are experiencing, it is more than surprising that companies are not taking advantage of these tools to become more visibly engaged in how they support their customers. It has long been my belief that customer service is the new marketing. Customers are watching and they are talking. Are you part of the conversation? I canvassed my network on Twitter to find out how businesses innovate their way out of a rut in customer service. The three best answers: John Marino at BRIO Publishing: we have challenges answering the phone so I offered $50 (cash in hand) to the person who answers the most calls. Employees felt if it wasn’t ringing in their department, they didn’t have to answer. The contest is weekly for all calls. It works! Sam Decker, CMO, Bazaarvoice: We have clients using UGC (reviews & answers) to train customer service, change policies, & respond to influencers. Mike Brewer: the more a company can put themselves out there by way of inviting feedback the better. And, if they utilize sites like Yelp in lieu of an internal feedback system, it suddenly has more merit. If you were to place a link or url address to Yelp on every piece of marketing material it would both invite and encourage people to participate in a conversation. In a perfect world that conversation would yield countless ways that you might serve your respective customer better. In a perfect world it would draw them into a participative and collaborative relationship that would not only yield better ways to serve but evangelist for your brand. Seek feedback, communicate with your customers about what you are doing to fix problems, find ways to be proactive, and make yourself accountable – 2009 will be the year of execution.

# BCSO: Family argument led to man walking through Callaway neighborhood firing pistol

CALLAWAY — A verbal argument between family members allegedly led to a Callaway man strapping on a bullet proof vest Saturday and walking through his Pridgen Street neighborhood firing a Beretta 9mm handgun. William Keifer Bradley Egan, age 26, was charged with two counts of Aggravated Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer and Wearing a Bullet Proof Vest in the Commission of a Felony. He was transported to the Bay County Jail. According to the Bay County Sheriff's Office, deputies responded to a call about a man walking through the neighborhood wearing a bullet proof vest and carrying a handgun, which he was firing randomly. When deputies arrived, Egan fired at the deputies, aiming over their patrol cars before taking off his vest and fleeing into a nearby field where he was taken into custody without incident. Egan allegedly told deputies he became angry after a verbal argument with his family and needed to take a walk to calm down, taking his bullet proof vest and pistol with him. A family member confronted him in the front yard and the two argued until Egan fired his pistol, once into the ground and then at the family member's car. The family member fled into the house and Egan continued through the neighborhood firing his pistol randomly until deputies arrived. According to BCSO, Egan told them he wanted to die by forcing a deputy to shoot him.<end_of_turn>

# Singing BGT granny Jenny Darren liked vile hate videos on YouTube

BRITAIN’s Got Talent singer Jenny Darren came across as a quirky pensioner with a hidden talent on Saturday night’s show.  But it turns out there’s a lot more to the OAP rocker than meets the eye — and every bit is deeply unpleasant.  I can reveal she has had a huge telling-off from show bosses after liking a string of homophobic and racist YouTube videos.  The singer, who became a bookies’ favourite to win the ITV series, has created a playlist on her account that includes clips which criticise homosexuality and label Jews a “pest to society”.  One shock video suggests our Royal Family are “imposters”, while Jews should be “hunted down”. Another calls LGBT relationships “a prevalent sin in society”.  Many more videos in Jenny’s playlist were deleted after my team went to her.  As she revealed on BGT, she is also a poet — but it turns out her work isn’t at all about love and flowers.  One poem written for her Facebook page, titled The Future, lashes out at LGBT relationships. A TV insider said: “Jenny’s behaviour online is shocking and inappropriate. She’s supposed to represent a family show but is instead setting an extremely bad example for her followers.  “It’s not only an embarrassment for Jenny, it’s a headache for the show and producers are fuming. Its most senior execs have discussed her future on BGT and have given her a huge telling-off.”  A show spokeswoman said: “Any prejudicial language or behaviour is abhorrent to everyone involved in BGT, which is an inclusive show.  “As a result, Jenny Darren has been reprimanded by producers regarding her previous statements, and has been warned over her future conduct. She has profusely apologised.”  It baffles my mind that it’s someone’s job to make sure contestants don’t have a murky past and yet this slips through.  Given she’s a vile no-mark, BGT should just ditch her now and be done with it.  must watch WHAT? For the Love of Dogs: India, ITV, 8.30pm.

Speaking at the opening night of Strictly Ballroom: The Musical in London’s West End, she hinted: “We’ve had wheelchair dancers. Possibly we could have same-sex couples.  “I’m sure everybody would be welcome.”  Hopefully the line-up is better than last year.

# Kinder Morgan gets green light to begin startup process for Elba Island LNG

Federal regulators have given Houston pipeline operator Kinder Morgan the green light to begin a weeks-long startup process for the first production unit at the company's Elba Island LNG export terminal in Savannah, Ga.  In a Friday order, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission officials gave Kinder Morgan permission to start introducing natural gas into equipment at the company's $2 billion liquefied natural gas plant.  The natural gas being introduced into the system will be used to test the plant's equipment in a weeks-long process known in the industry as "commissioning."  Kinder Morgan hopes to have the first of 10 production units being built on the Elba Island facility in service by the end of the first quarter.  The facility will be able to produce up to 2.5 million metric tons of LNG per year once the 10 are operational, roughly of enough natural gas to fuel about 1.75 million U.S. homes for a day.  Elba Island LNG is a joint venture between Kinder Morgan and Washington, D.C.-based private equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners.  Originally built as an LNG import terminal, record natural gas production in U.S. shale basins prompted Kinder Morgan to seek permission to reconfigure the facility into an export terminal.  Kinder Morgan found a partner in oil and refining giant Shell, which holds a 20-year contract to market and export all the LNG produced at the Georgia facility.  Market Trends: U.S. LNG export capacity to more than double by end of 2019  Elba Island LNG is coming online at a time of growing global demand for liquefied natural gas. The U.S. LNG industry currently exports 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. However, that figure is expected to grow to 14 billion cubic feet per day by 2030 — a 496 percent increase.<end_of_turn>

# Trudeau speaks with Venezuela's Guaido, praises 'courage and leadership' - Journal du Cameroun

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke Sunday with Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, praising the “courage and leadership” of the national assembly head whom Ottawa recognizes as interim president, according to a statement.  The phone call comes a day before a meeting of the 14-nation Lima Group — made up of Canada and Latin American countries — in Ottawa. Eleven of its members have recognized Guaido.  “The two leaders discussed the importance of the international community sending a clear message regarding the illegitimacy of the Maduro regime and the need to respect the Venezuelan Constitution,” a readout of the call from Trudeau’s office said.  “Both underscored the importance that free and fair Presidential elections be held. The Prime Minister commended Juan Guaido for his courage and leadership in helping to return democracy to Venezuela and offered Canada’s continued support.”  Trudeau added that the Lima Group meeting “will consider how the international community can further support the people of Venezuela, including through immediate humanitarian assistance.”  Venezuela is in the midst of a power struggle that began on January 21 when a group of soldiers took control of a command post north of Caracas and released a video rejecting the legitimacy of President Nicolas Maduro, who won a second term last May in elections deemed fraudulent by the opposition and many the international community.  Two days later, Guaido stunned the world by proclaiming himself “acting president,” pledging a transitional government and free elections.  The opposition’s support has been stoked by the parlous state of the economy. Venezuela, once the richest country in in Latin America thanks to its oil revenues, is facing severe shortages of food and medicine, as well as runaway inflation.  In addition to Canada, the United States, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal and Britain and many Latin American countries, including Colombia and Brazil, have declared support for Guaido.  On the other hand, Russia, China, Turkey and Iran support their ally Maduro.<end_of_turn>

# 7 siblings to look after: Sonam reveals about actress who didn't speak up against harassment

Sonam Kapoor has been a vocal proponent of the revolutionary #MeToo movement and has always supported women to speak up against sexual harassment. The 'Ek Larki ko Dekha Tou Aisa Laga' actress in a shocking revelation made during interview with Business of Fashion shared reasons due to which celebrities do not speak about their harrowing sexual encounters.  The 33-year-old starlet also revealed about a friend of hers who had faced similar experiences in the film industry but chose to remain silent about it. Talking about her friend, Sonam said that the girl did not want to be known as a victim for the rest of her life, especially in the film industry. She added that the girl wanted to be desirable as her whole career was built on that and that she also had to feed the stomachs of  seven of her siblings and the rest of the family. On the work front, Sonam's latest offering 'Ek Larki Ko Dekha Tou Aisa Laga' has earned her appraisals from industry bigwigs for playing a gay girl with commendable audacity. The film also happened to be Sonam’s first ever collaboration with her father Anil Kapoor in Bollywood.<end_of_turn>

# Soldier almost lost an eye after being hit with broken bottle

A former solider was left traumatised after being hit with a bottle as he came to the rescue of a stranger on a night out.  Cory Schofield, 22, was left needing surgery and 31 stitches after Jose-Maria Alves-Semedo-Junior attacked him with a broken glass.  Earlier in the night Alves, 28, had been involved in fight with a man inside outside a bar and picked up both a bottle and a broken bottleneck.  A doorman took the bottle off him and made him leave, getting cut by Alves in the process, but did not see the bottleneck in his other hand.  Alves, who is originally from Cape Verde, made off down the road but later got into an argument with Mr Schofield, who was out for the night with friends. Family 'killed son believing he was possessed by a demon' Passer-by Ryan Spencer then walked towards them, raising his fist in what was described as a ‘drunken greeting’ and Alves lashed out, stabbing him in the back of the neck.  Mr Schofield punched Alves, who then responded by thrusting the broken bottle into his face.  Alves was arrested as he tried to flee the town centre in a taxi, Bolton Crown Court was told.  Mr Schofield passed out and was rushed to hospital following the 3am attack in Bradshawgate near Bolton, on October 20 last year.  The ex-soldier, who served in the Fusiliers for three years, said: ‘The only thing I remember is my head pouring with blood and just collapsing. Boy, 14, makes £15,000 a year after launching online toy shop ‘Nothing has scared me more in my life than this. That I could have died or lost an eye breaks my heart.  ‘This incident has really scared me to the point where I struggle to leave the house now.’  Mr Schofield has since lost his job as a dental technician due to PTSD he now suffers as a result of that night.  He is due to undergo cosmetic surgery and is so self-conscious about his scar he wears a baseball cap in public to hide it.  Alves was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to two counts of intentionally causing grievous bodily harm, causing actual bodily harm and possessing an offensive weapon.  The sentence means he will miss out on the first years of his baby son’s life, who was born last Thursday.  Judge Richard Gioserano rejected Alves’ claim that he was defending himself and said: ‘This is the sort of thing that happens all the time outside pubs and clubs but people don’t get stabbed with broken glass’  He added: ‘This was extreme violence by you with a weapon. It is the sort of behaviour that scares people from going out at all.  ‘People have to understand it will not be tolerated.’<end_of_turn>

# BJP, Congress Spar Over Headley's Deposition in Ishrat Case

NEW DELHI: The BJP and the Congress on Thursday sparred after terrorist-turned-approver David Coleman Headley's court deposition that Ishrat Jahan -- shot dead in a shootout along with three others in 2004 -- was a Laskhar-e-Taiba operative. While the Bharatiya Janata Party demanded an apology from Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice president Rahul Gandhi, the opposition party questioned attempts to justify the "fake" Ishrat Jahan encounter which it said were "not permissible by law". Ishrat, a 19-year-old college student, Pranesh Pillai alias Javed Gulam Sheikh, Amjad Ali Rana and Zeeshan Johar were killed on Ahmedabad's outskirts in an alleged shootout with the police on June 15, 2004.  The police claimed that the four were LeT operatives plotting to assassinate the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.  "Jahan was an LeT member," Pakistan-American Headley said in his sensational disclosure while deposing before Special TADA Court Judge A. Sanap in Mumbai via video-conferencing from a US jail on Thursday.  Headley said the 2008 Mumbai attack mastermind Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi told him about "a botched up operation in India" of shooting at the police at a check-post in Gujarat. A LeT woman operative was involved, Headley sais while identifying her as Thane college student Ishrat Jahan, out of the three names -- Noorjehan Begum, Ishrat Jahan and Mumtaz Begum -- given by Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam.  BJP leader Shrikant Sharma said in Delhi that Sonia and Rahul should tender an apology following Headley's testimony.  "These Congress leaders should apologise to the nation and to the heroes who killed LeT terrorist Ishrat Jahan and her three accomplices," he said.  "Instead of praising the brave policemen, questions were raised on their sincerity and they were put behind bars. Now the mask has come off their faces," Sharma said.  He said the Congress hatched a conspiracy to politicise terror in order to defame the Bharatiya Janata Party and Modi. On the other hand, Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari questioned the attempts to use Headley's testimony to justify the "fake" shootout. He said if the government wants to investigate further if Jahan and her accomplices were Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives or not, there was nothing which stops it.  "But the fundamental question remains: Whether Ishrat and her accomplices were killed in a fake encounter or not?" Tewari added.  Tewari said even if a person is a terrorist, he needs to be arrested and needs to be brought to justice like parliament attack convict Afzal Guru.  "But to try and justify a fake encounter, I am afraid, is something which the law does not permit," the Congress leader said.  Headley's earlier testimony before a National Investigation Agency team in 2011 in the US claimed Jahan was a Lashkar terrorist.<end_of_turn>

# 3 reasons why I’d invest in a Chinese recovery in the year of the pig

Today is Chinese New Year, heralding the Year of the Pig, according to the country’s zodiac. The pig is a symbol of wealth in Chinese culture so let’s hope that’s a promising sign, because many investors are feeling crabby about China’s prospects right now.  New year, old worries  The country’s economy grew at an official rate of ‘just’ 6.6% in 2018, which may seem enviable by Western standards but marks a 28-year low for China. Worse, the true growth rate is probably well below the official version.  China’s debt mountain is another big worry, with public and private debt now standing at an impossible-to-imagine $34trn at last count, or 266% of GDP. China is challenging but I can think of three reasons why now could actually be a good buy right now.  1. It’s cheap!  Last year, the MSCI China index fell 18.75%, against a drop of 14.24% for emerging markets generally and 12% for the FTSE 100. In a bad year for stocks, China fared particularly badly.  What this means is that China is cheap, or at least, cheaper than it was. So is Asia generally. Andrew Graham, co-portfolio manager at Martin Currie Asia Unconstrained Trust, reckons the region’s markets now trade at a 20% discount to the rest of the world, making this a buying opportunity.  Although China is unlikely to return to the glory days of the BRICs phenomenon, it can still turn on the style. In 2017 MSCI China rose 54.33% (albeit after four disappointing years). Why not get in before the next surge upwards?  2. The trade war may end  The biggest shadow over the Chinese economy right now is US President Donald Trump’s trade war, which is thought to have cost both sides billions of dollars. There is a further round of talks this week amid speculation that some kind of compromise could be found. That would light a rocket under global markets in general, and China in particular.  If no deal isn’t reached by Trump’s 2 March deadline then he may slap 25% tariffs on all of China’s $500bn exports. However, Beijing is responding by fuelling domestic demand, including tax cuts, and this could offset some of the lost export income.  3. The dollar is weakening  The strong US dollar has hit all emerging markets, including China, because it makes their vast dollar-denominated debts even more onerous. As Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell points out: “A strong US currency makes it more expensive to service this borrowing, sucking cash out of emerging market economies and hampering growth.”  The dollar was strong in 2018 and China’s renminbi was weak. That may change, with the US Federal Reserve backing away from further interest rate increases and slowing attempts to unwind QE.  You could play a Chinese recovery by purchasing FTSE 100 stocks with exposure to the country, such as high-yielding mining giant Glencore, luxury goods firm Burberry and spirits giant Diageo. Or even luxury sports car maker Aston Martin.  China is risky but there is still a chance that the year of the pig could live up to its name, and spread a little investor wealth around.  Of course, picking the right shares and the strategy to be successful in the stock market isn't easy.

# Nick Foles is prepared to pay the Eagles to become a free agent

Nick Foles will be paying his way to getting paid this offseason.  The Eagles informed the quarterback they would be picking up his option for 2019 on Tuesday, and Foles quickly responded that he would be voiding it — a move that would cost him $2 million, paid to his soon-to-be ex-bosses.  Philadelphia can still place a franchise tag on Foles to retain the ability to trade him, though it could be a costly move if there are no takers and he ends up backing up starter Carson Wentz for somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million.  Foles stepped up after Wentz went down with injuries in the past two seasons, bringing a Super Bowl title to the Eagles in 2017 and leading them to the playoff in 2018.  If he does hit the free agent market, the 30-year-old will have his fair share of suitors after completing 72 percent of his passes and throwing for seven touchdowns in five regular-season games in 2018. The Jaguars, Broncos and Redskins are all in need of a quarterback for the upcoming season, while the Giants might be tempted to explore Foles as a stopgap solution behind Eli Manning.<end_of_turn>

		 LMT mobile operator aims to increase share of exports to 30% of turnover  With Internet usage rapidly increasing and 5G arriving, the telecommunications industry is undergoing a major transformation, and if used wisely, this moment provides opportunities for developing competencies and generating additional revenue, Binde said. “All the necessary preconditions are already in place, including one of the world’s most effective networks and skilled professionals who generate innovative ideas each day and by cooperating with partners find ways to implement them,” Binde said. The LMT head emphasized that in the future mobile operators will have to focus on the 5G technology in order to ensure comprehensive mobile communication. LMT Vice President Ingmars Pukis informed that for the second year already, the company will participate in the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, in order to reach out to potential clients in foreign countries and expand the export market. As reported, LMT saw its consolidated turnover grow 6% y-o-y to EUR 216 mln in 2018, while the group’s profit last year was EUR 29 mln. The company’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was EUR 66 mln. LMT was registered in 1992 as the first mobile operator in Latvia. Sonera Holding and Telia Company each own 24.5% of LMT shares, Lattelecom and Latvian State Radio and Television Center - 23% each, and Latvian Privatization Agency - 5%.<end_of_turn>

# Navy center has been more productive performer during Patriot League play

Every coach appreciates a player who truly wants to improve and puts in the work necessary to do so. Evan Wieck fits that description perfectly for the Navy men’s basketball program. The junior center is an earnest type of person who accepts coaching and puts in extra time on the court in an effort to better himself as a player. “Evan is a guy who actually does what the coaching staff asks of him. When we tell Evan to work on something in practice, he goes out there and diligently does so,” Navy head coach Ed DeChellis said. “Evan does a good job of playing to his strengths. He understands what he can and can’t do and stays in his lane.” Wieck has been one of Navy’s most productive performers during Patriot League play, averaging 11 points and seven rebounds through 10 games. That marks a significant improvement over Wieck’s non-conference numbers as he averaged 5.1 points and 3.1 rebounds through 11 contests.  That is due to a combination of Wieck stepping up his game and the coaching staff making a conscious effort to get him more involved with the offense. “We didn’t give Evan the ball enough during the non-conference, which was my fault,” DeChellis said. “As I evaluated things over the Christmas holiday, I realized he was just not getting enough touches in the post. We had to do a better job of feeding the ball inside because it sinks the defense.” DeChellis and assistant Emmett Davis work with the Navy big men and have put considerable effort into making Wieck a more viable post option. The 6-foot-8, 235-pounder has developed a right-handed jump hook and an up-and-under move that is a nice complement. “Evan has become a more effective interior scorer. He can catch the ball down on the block and do some things with it,” DeChellis said. “Evan is also running the floor well and slipping ball screens better. He has gotten some easy layups that way.” Wieck, who averaged just 5.5 points a year ago, is being more aggressive offensively after being too quick to throw the ball back out to the perimeter after catching it in the post. “I think the coaching staff has been trying to get the ball inside more. That is providing more offensive opportunities for me and also producing more kick-outs for open threes,” he said. “I’ve been working hard on posting up hard and improving my passing. Once I get the ball inside I need to be strong going to the basket or make sure I pass it to the right guy. I’d definitely say I’m a lot more confident offensively than I was last year at this time.” Wieck also does considerable damage by putting back offensive rebounds. He leads Navy with 60 offensive boards, almost double the number of the team’s second-best player in that department. If Wieck does not convert an offensive rebound immediately into points, he does a good job of resetting the offense. The Texas native has hauled down 41 offensive rebounds in Patriot League games and Navy has scored on 23 of those extra possessions, netting 47 second-chance points. “Evan takes pride in rebounding the basketball. He has a real nose for the ball and goes hard for offensive boards,” DeChellis said. “Evan made a big play against Loyola when he grabbed an offensive rebound and extended the possession with about two minutes left in the game.” While Wieck is not a shot-blocker, he does a good job of holding his ground and using high hands to make it tough on opponents that drive to the basket. He has altered many attempts while preventing numerous others. “Evan covers up a lot of people’s sins defensively. He does a nice job of controlling the paint and preventing people from getting easy layups,” DeChellis said. “One thing Evan has to work on is not fouling so much. He needs to eliminate the foolish fouls because he’s too important to the team. We need him on the floor.” What Wieck has discovered this season is that activity and energy can translate into production. “I’ve just tried to bring a mentality of playing as hard as I can at all times. Rebounding and defense are mostly effort,” he said. “I try to focus on running the right plays, setting the right screens – just doing all the fundamental things properly. If you do that, good things will happen.” DeChellis said Wieck is almost always one of the first players to take the court for practice and among the last to leave. He’ll stay late to catch 100 passes in the post while working on various moves. “Evan comes to practice and works extremely hard every day. He’s a lunch pail type of guy that does whatever you ask him to do,” DeChellis said. “It’s nice to see Evan starting to see the fruits of his labor.” Wieck, by nature, is a quiet sort who prefers to lead by example. That being said, the Amarillo High product is one of the toughest players on the team and will not back down from anybody. “Evan is a real hard worker who is going to give you all he’s got every time he steps on the floor. I’ve told him not to accept anything less from anyone else,” DeChellis said. “He has a hard time being assertive in that way. We’re trying to get Evan to be more vocal and bark at some guys a bit.” Wieck reached double figures in just one non-conference contest and was held to six points or less in nine. He has hit double digits in six of the last eight Patriot League games. It has been a similar story in terms of rebounding with Wieck snagging 11 or more in three of the last five outings. DeChellis saw the potential for an impactful big man when Wieck achieved career-highs with 19 points and 15 rebounds against Lehigh. “Evan is playing with a lot of confidence right now and it’s great to see,” DeChellis said. “He has been making a lot of winning basketball plays for this team.” Former Navy assistant Dan Earl first spotted Wieck at an Amateur Athletic Union tournament in Texas. Wieck was easily sold on the Naval Academy and willingly attended Hargrave Military Academy in order to improve as both a basketball player and student. At Hargrave, Wieck was a role player off the bench for a team that compiled a 47-1 record and captured the prep school national championship. It featured such current Division I standouts as Derek Funderburk (Ohio State), Braxton Beverly (N.C. State) and De’Riante Jenkins (Virginia Commonwealth). “Going to Hargrave was a major step up and set a good baseline for me,” Wieck said. “That being said, I’ve never really been in this position of having a major role on the team like I do now. I’ve usually been a supporting type of player just doing my job. So I’ve had to change my mindset a little bit.” twitter.com/BWagner_CapGaz<end_of_turn>

Far Southeast Side  In her first term, Ald. Susan Sadlowski Garza has steered millions of dollars in TIF funds toward the repairs of crumbling infrastructure in the ward, including repairs on bridges and at schools. More than two dozen businesses have opened to help bring about 1,600 jobs. The Far South Side got its first dog park, which was long overdue, and it’s in this ward. Change isn’t coming fast enough for her opponent, Robert “Bobby” Loncar, who wants revitalization of commercial districts in the ward that includes Calumet Heights, the East Side, Hegewisch, South Chicago and South Deering. We want that, too, and believe Sadlowski Garza is qualified to take the lead. She is endorsed. We ask, however, that Sadlowski Garza make a change in how she organizes the ward’s Labor Day parade, an event she revived. Currently, checks to participate in the parade are made out to Friends of Susan Sadlowski Garza. That creates the appearance, if nothing more, that she is using the community event to raise campaign funds. She says all money goes into putting the event together. So fine.

# Restaurant, distillery team to create caviar-infused gin

Feb. 5 (UPI) -- An upscale British restaurant teamed with a distillery to create a house gin infused with an unusual flavor -- caviar.  The Man Behind the Curtain, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Leeds, England, teamed with distillery Slingsby to create the gin, which shares the restaurant's name. The creators said the gin was distilled with plankton and Exmoor Caviar to create a "savoury, unique and deliciously bold" flavor.  The gin is available as an ingredient in specialty cocktails at the eatery, and bottles of the seafood-infused spirit can be bought at the restaurant for $130.<end_of_turn>

# Step up, celebrities, and get vaccinated in public: It's time for a national movement to counter anti-vax hysteria - NY Daily News

Imagine the following scenario; we promise, it doesn’t end with a punchline.  Taylor Swift and Kayne West, LeBron James and Steph Curry, Bill Gates and Tom Cook, and Stephen Colbert and Tucker Carlson walk into a room. They sit down next to each other and exchange pleasantries while they wait for the doctor to arrive. When she does, they each roll up a sleeve while she thanks them for their participation and assures them they’re helping a lot of people — and themselves.  One by one, they allow her to administer the flu vaccine. A posse of photographers and national news outlets shoot video footage of the event.  Some of the celebrities ask questions.  “I’ve never had the flu before, why should I get the shot now,” asks LeBron?  “Can my grandchild get this too?” Gates wonders.  “What about the mercury?” Kanye queries.  The doctor answers each question. “All it takes is one bad strain that your body doesn’t recognize and you could land in the hospital.”  “Any child 6 months of age or older can and should get the flu vaccine.”  “Methylmercury — the kind of mercury found in some fish like tuna — and dimethylmercury, which is rarely used anymore due to its extremely neurotoxic nature, are bad for you. But ethylmercury, which is found in some vaccines, is harmless. It sounds similar, but its chemical composition is different. Like how elemental hydrogen and elemental oxygen can both lead to explosions, but when you put them together, they make up the most important molecule for life: water.”  Ten minutes later, they’re all done.  “That was painless,” the A-listers agree as they leave the doctor’s office. Then they take out their cell phones and tag selfies on their social media platforms: #VaccinesWork #ITrustVaccines or #WorthAShot.  We paint you this fantasy picture not because it’s fun to imagine these celebrities in the same room, but because America has a growing vaccine trust problem.  Despite the recent rise of vaccine-preventable illnesses like measles, more and more families are choosing to opt out of vaccination. Motivations not to vaccinate range widely, but some of most common concerns reflect a distrust of the government, a distrust of pharmaceutical companies, and a distrust of the medical community. An all-too-common (and factually incorrect) meme circulating among anti-vax groups is that outspoken vaccine advocates like Bill Gates don’t vaccinate their own children, so why should they vaccinate theirs?  That’s where celebrities can help. Like it or not, we live in a culture in which celebrities hold the power to influence not only our beliefs, but our actions. When Taylor Swift encouraged her Instagram followers to register to vote in October 2018, for example, 169,000 new people did so with two days.  Consider the mid-1950s, just after the Dr. Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine had been approved. At the time, young children were vaccinated by the millions. But teenagers were also susceptible to polio, and they were not being vaccinated. That’s when Elvis — yes, that Elvis — became involved. In 1956, in an effort to close the immunization gap that existed between those who got vaccinated for polio and those who didn’t, Elvis Presley was approached to popularize the polio vaccine among American teens. In October of that year, Elvis got vaccinated on national television.  Of course, many of the vaccines we need are given during early childhood, so we’d need to ask public figures with young children to consent to their children being publicly vaccinated as well.  Vaccine skeptics have been demonized a lot lately, but that’s not necessarily fair. Like the rest of us, they just want to do what’s best for their families. Unfortunately, misinformation has become pervasive; often, it’s celebrities who have spread it, including one who happens to be the current President of the United States.  That’s why we need to step up our game to counter the false information: show them vaccines aren’t harmful by putting our money where our mouth is. At the end of the day, we all have the same goal: to be healthy. We just need to harness our collective power, and our celebrities, and get started.<end_of_turn>

# Wine drinkers could be seeing red over Brexit price rises

Never mind borders or backstops - the most recent bad news to come out of Brexit has shown that the price of wine could go up.  The Journal of Wine Economics featured an industry study that says that the amount customers pay could increase by up to 25 per cent by 2025 in the event of a hard Brexit, or 11 per cent in terms of a softer Brexit. 
According to a report by WSTA, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, 99 percent of wine drunk in the UK is imported. Of this half is produced in the EU, while the remainder comes from Australia, USA, Chile, Argentina, South Africa and New Zealand.  
There are concerns that if the right measures are not put in place it could stop imports from crossing the border, which has lead some retailers to stock up on bottles in advance. 
The WSTA has been advising members for more than a year that they should increase their stock by 20 per cent as a starting point in case of a no deal Brexit. 
Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: “Since the Referendum, the WSTA has campaigned consistently for a deal with the EU that delivers frictionless trade in goods, with no additional tariffs or costs. 
“If the UK ends up with a no-deal Brexit then wine businesses will have to cope with additional tariffs as well as another duty rise - which is highly likely to end up full square in the consumer’s lap, bumping up wine prices to an all-time high. 
“Currently there are no tariffs on wines from the EU, Chile and South Africa. A no deal Brexit would result in the introduction of tariffs, estimated to cost UK wine importing businesses over £100 million a year. 
“The introduction of no deal Brexit tariffs would be a double blow for wine businesses after the Chancellor elected to single out wine for a duty rise at the Autumn Budget.” 
From February 1 the duty on a bottle of wine went up by 7p, but add a tariff to the duty rise and VAT and this means an average priced bottle of wine, which today costs £5.73, will cost £5.93 in the event of no deal. Read more: How will Brexit affect your travel plans?   
This is an extra 53p a bottle more than consumers paid before the referendum result when an average priced bottle of wine was £5.40. 
There could be some positive benefits for British vineyards however. 
It is believed that British wines will seem less expensive than its European counterparts as retailers won’t be forced to hike prices because of rate or tariffs. 
There are more than 500 vineyards and about 130 wineries in England and Wales, many of these specialising in sparkling wines. 
However, British vineyards could be hit with the lack of skilled workers from the EU and vital agricultural funding streams.  
The WSTA also wants confirmation that funding that was before provided by the EU will be picked up somewhere else. 
Tamara Roberts, CEO at Ridgeview in East Sussex, said: “As we prepare for Brexit, it will be critical that the government does all it can to help English wine grow and that includes continued access to funding streams. 
“Complete confidence in the quality of our wines has allowed us to expand production but so has access to funding streams, some of which derive from EU structural funds.” 
At the moment, while the future is uncertain as to what will happen with Brexit come March 29, it may be worthwhile buying a bottle or two extra of your favourite European tipple. Just in case.<end_of_turn>

# NE Patriot Duron Harmon says he’s not interested in visiting the Trump White House

I totally forgot/blanked on the fact that the “Patriots getting invited to the Trump White House” was such a big story in 2017. Russian asset Donald Trump had just risen to power and he was a bigly fan of the New England Patriots. They won the Super Bowl that year, and their win set off months of back-and-forth reporting about which players would skip out on the invitation to the Trump All-White House. Tom Brady – who kept a MAGA hat in his locker in 2016 – made some noise about how he didn’t understand why anyone would have a problem with him cozying up to a white supremacist, but in the end, Brady didn’t even go to the White House. Then again, he didn’t go when President Obama was in office either. Trump looked bigly upset that Brady didn’t come to the WH too. Well, cue another two months of speculation, probably. Less than 24 hours after the Patriots’ Super Bowl win, a Patriot has already come out and said he has no desire to visit the Trump White House.   New England Patriots safety Duron Harmon — one of the key players in the Super Bowl — says he will NOT be joining the team to visit Donald Trump … explaining, “They don’t want me in the White House.” Harmon was a STUD on Sunday night — stepping in when Patrick Chung went down with an injury and making two of the biggest plays of the game. First, he broke up what would have been a TD pass to L.A. Rams WR Brandin Cooks in the 4th quarter — and later on in the game, he was the guy who forced Jared Goff to throw that final interception.  After the game, we saw Harmon leaving Mercedes-Benz Stadium with his son — and they were TURNED UP!! Duron had big celebration plans — he was looking forward to hanging out with Snoop, Cardi B and Meek Mill — but he ain’t making the trip to Washington D.C. Harmon said “it would be dope” to follow the lead of the Golden State Warriors and visit Barack Obama instead. You know what I appreciate? I appreciate that the NBA has led the way for “sports teams snubbing the Trump White House.” Between LeBron James and the entirety of the Golden State Warriors organization, they’ve given political cover to any team or athlete to snub Trump. Even college teams have refused to go to the Trump White House in the past two years. Anyway, it wouldn’t surprise me if the Patriots do get invited, and it wouldn’t surprise me if most of the players avoid the trip, Tom Brady included. I mean, how many cold McDonald’s cheeseburgers can Gronk really eat?  Photos courtesy of Getty.<end_of_turn>

# Blackhawks score five times in third period to get past slumping Oilers | The Star

EDMONTON—Exploding for five goals in the third period has kept the Chicago Blackhawks on a roll. Patrick Kane had a goal and an assist as the Blackhawks defeated the Edmonton Oilers 6-2 on Tuesday for their fifth-straight win. “We know what we are doing is working and we are hanging in games,” said Chicago captain Jonathan Toews. “Whether we are ahead or down a goal going into the third period, we can find ways to create offence and come out on top. It is nice for our team to win in different ways, it only adds to our confidence.” Erik Gustafsson, John Hayden, Dylan Strome, Drake Caggiula and Dominik Kahun also scored for the Blackhawks (21-24-9), who has managed to get back into the wild-card playoff race. Leon Draisaitl scored both goals for Edmonton (23-25-5), which matched a season-high sixth-straight loss. “Same type of thing as the last couple of games. We control a lot of the first two (periods), and then go to sleep in the third,” said Oilers captain Connor McDavid. “I’m not sure what that is. We can talk all we want. We’ve just got to find a way to grab (the game) when it’s going like that.” Cam Ward stopped 25 shots for the win in net. Cam Talbot turned aside 23-of-27 shots for Edmonton before giving way to Mikko Koskinen, who made six saves. Chicago struck first before the game was two minutes old when a Gustafsson point shot ticked off the side of defender Adam Larsson’s leg and got past Talbot just four seconds into a power play. Edmonton tied the game up on a power play of its own with three minutes left in the opening period when Draisaitl pounced on a rebound for his 30th goal of the season. The Oilers made it 2-1 on a two-man advantage with just over a minute remaining as McDavid fed it across to Draisaitl, who scored again on a one-timer. The Blackhawks tied the game four minutes into the third as an Edmonton turnover led to a goal by Hayden, and then surged into the lead 1:33 later when a Strome shot went through Darnell Nurse’s legs and past Talbot. Kane extended the lead to 4-2 just 28 seconds later when he lifted a stick to score his 32nd of the season. It extended his point streak to 12 games. Switching Talbot out for Koskinen didn’t turn the tide as the Blackhawks scored again a mere 27 seconds after on a goal by Caggiula, a former Oiler. Edmonton allowed a fifth goal in the third period on the power play on a tally by Kahun with eight minutes left. “It is nice to keep this roll going and finally turn things a bit,” said Chicago coach Jeremy Colliton. “We have a bit of momentum and we are playing well. When you have the momentum and keep playing well, you usually get the results. We just need to keep pushing and we will get our points.” Both teams are back in action on Thursday as the Blackhawks return home to host the Vancouver Canucks and the Oilers head to Minnesota to play the Wild.<end_of_turn>

# Katie Price could put Harvey, 16, in residential care as his siblings are "scared of him"

Katie Price could put Harvey, 16, in residential care as his siblings are "scared of him"  6 February 2019, 12:20 | Updated: 6 February 2019, 12:24  The former model and campaigner revealed that for the first time ever she is considering putting her eldest child Harvey, who has a range of behavioural issues, into residential care.  Katie Price, 40, has revealed that she is considering getting Harvey residential care from Monday to Friday for the first time ever. In an interview with Victoria Derbyshire on the BBC she spoke openly about Harvey and his medical issues as well as her recent success with 'Harvey's Law' to combat online trolls and the struggles she faces as his carer. Joined by 16-year-old Harvey on the daytime show she said: "I don't think people realise how hard it is."  "It is challenging so I respect everyone out there, even looking after the elderly." Turning to Harvey she said: "I do everything for you - you're like the king!" When she asked him what bad behaviour he has started at home he replied: "Smash the windows" and revealed that he has smashed eight iPads due to his behavioural problems. Katie explained: "He doesn't realise the expense, and he's a danger to himself and for the first time ever now I'm thinking he should go residential Monday to Friday."  His behavioural outbursts are also starting to affect his education and Katie revealed that "if he kicks off in the morning the driver won't take him to school". "He's missing out on his education, he just wants to be with me all the time." "I hate it because he's my life but I have to do what's best for him." Harvey was born blind and has Prader-Willi syndrome of which symptoms include obesity and learning disabilities. He is Katie's eldest child from her relationship with footballer Dwight Yorke.<end_of_turn>

# Lifted 2020 Toyota Supra Rendered as the Sportscar Toyota Needs to Build

Sporstcars don't make money. With the obvious exceptions, this is a rule that means carmakers sometimes have a hard time designing the go-fast machines that fill our screens. In fact, this is why Toyota and BMW decided to join forces for their current two-seater effort, which involves the 2020 Supra and the 2019 Z4. The result of the collaboration saw plenty of Supra fans jumping for joy thanks to the revival of the badge, even though there were some aficionados who weren't pleased with the design limitations the shared platform brought. 
 As such, there were plenty of renderings that showed up soon after the MK V Supra was released, with these aiming to give the newcomer a look that sits closer to Gen IV nostalgics' expectations. 
 Then again, those renders have nothing to to with production reality, at least not as far as the Japanese carmaker is concerned - there will obviously be tuner efforts of the sort, though. 
 However, the pixel play that brought us here today is different. Sure, this might be wilder than most others of the sort, but it portrays a model that might just make sense for Toyota. 
 You see, if the company ends up building a lifted Supra, it will draw tons of attention to the brand (call it sub-brand, if you want to refer to the Gazoo Racing arm of the company). 
 And you should that this terrain-taming Supra rendering is not an accident. In fact, digital art label Rain Prisk, which delivered the piece, has just made another step forward for jportscars. 
 You know, jacked-up sportscars. This is an emerging genre and while it mostly relies on renderings and custom cars at the moment, there are also clues of carmakers willing to exploit the possibilities of this style. 
 Just think of the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo (even though calling it a sportscar is a stretch, this has been confirmed for production) and you'll get a brilliant example of why SUV alternatives are welcome.

# How to Keep Your Design Files Organized - TFOT

A logo is only one of the many designs you will use as a business. The logo may have several versions stored in different files. You then have the designs for letterheads, identities, brochures, promotional materials, and many others to maintain. It doesn’t take long before you start dealing with hundreds of design files related to your business. Keeping them organized is a necessity and not an option. When you have a good design file management system, you can always find the design files you need at any moment. The file management system also allows you to protect your design files better, all while maintaining consistency with your materials. Even better, you don’t have to use a complex system to keep your design files organized. These tips and tricks will help you get started with managing your files. Use Folders, Filenames, and Tags First, organize your files in a certain way. You can separate types of designs into folders, and then add project-specific subfolders to make searching for a specific file easier. With the logo design files, for example, you can use Logo as the main folder, and use subfolders such as Fonts, Vectors, and more to organize materials accordingly. The same can be said for filenames. You want the filenames to be searchable, to make finding a specific material easier. Rather than naming a poster that you use for a promotional offer Poster_1.ai, be more specific and add additional details. Poster-SummerSale-082018.ai is a lot easier to search, don’t you think? Archive Unused Design Files It is not uncommon to have tons of design files going in and out of your drive, especially when working on a project. The Summer Sale poster we used as an example earlier, for instance, may have several versions before it – after revisions and changes – is finalized. You can either choose to delete the revision files or keep them. If the latter is what you want to do, create an extra subfolder for each project and store all revision files inside that folder. Once the project is completed, you can archive the project folder and keep your main design folder efficient. Back Up and Restore Speaking of archiving your unused design files, it is also a good idea to maintain multiple copies – stored in different places – to provide extra protection for essential design files. Logo files and other critical designs are assets that you want to sufficiently protect. Maintaining multiple copies and backing up the design files to the cloud are the two things you need to do from the start. At the very least, you can recover most of the files you need in the event of a data loss or hardware failure. You also have professional recovery services from top providers like Secure Data Recovery acting as an added security layer. When your files get damaged in transit, Secure Data Recovery can perform USB or SD card recovery to get those essential files back.  One last tip to keep in mind: stay organized no matter what. With the design files properly organized, you can always find the files you need with a simple search. Better file management leads to a faster and more efficient design workflow that also supports your business’s marketing efforts.<end_of_turn>

# Sudan protesters rally in support of detained anti-Bashir activists

Sudan protesters rally in support of detained anti-Bashir activists  The Sudanese Professionals Association, which has led the demonstrations, says detainees are being tortured  Khartoum— Crowds of Sudanese protesters rallied on Thursday in downtown Khartoum in support of fellow demonstrators detained in the weeks of rallies against President Omar al-Bashir’s iron-fisted rule, witnesses said.  The latest protest came after Bashir acknowledged that Sudan’s controversial public order law and growing economic hardships had angered youths and sent them out into the streets.  The rally was called to express solidarity with the hundreds of demonstrators who have been arrested since anti-government rallies erupted in December 2018.  The protesters returned to the downtown area, chanting their campaign’s rallying cry of “freedom, peace, justice”, witnesses said. For almost two weeks a security clampdown had prevented them from converging on the capital’s downtown area.  “Bring all your soldiers but today you will fall,” chanted the protesters, witnesses said, adding that riot police swiftly confronted them with tear gas.  “The authorities thought we won’t be able to reach downtown,” a demonstrator told AFP without giving his name for security reasons. “It has been difficult, but today we have managed to do it.” The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which has led the demonstrations, called Thursday’s protests specifically in support of the detainees who it says are being “tortured”. On Wednesday, Bashir acknowledged that youths, mainly women, were leading the rallies and said the public order law was “one of the reasons” for their anger. Activists say the decades-old law targets mainly women, often accusing them of “indecent dressing and immoral behaviour”. Hefty punishments, including fines and jail terms, are imposed on women found guilty under the legislation. According to some Sudanese women’s rights groups, more than 15,000 women were sentenced to flogging in 2016. Bashir, who swept to power in a 1989 Islamist-backed coup, said the harsh economic conditions in Sudan, such as high inflation, were also driving the protests. “It’s not only the public order law that we are against,” said Tahani, a female protester who asked not to be fully named for security concerns. “Once we overthrow the regime, we will change the old laws completely with new laws that respect the dignity and diversity of the Sudanese people.” Protests first erupted on December 19 after a government decision to raise the price of bread. But they quickly turned into nationwide rallies against Bashir’s three-decade-old rule, with protesters calling for his resignation. Officials say 30 people have died in protest-related violence, while Human Rights Watch says at least 51 people have been killed in clashes with security forces. AFP<end_of_turn>

# Weighing the Good and Bad of Google Stock Post Q4 Earnings

Technology giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) reported fourth-quarter numbers after the bell on Monday, Feb. 4. Although the company topped both revenue and profit estimates, Google stock dropped in response due to concerns regarding swelling costs.  Specifically, operating margins dropped to 21%. That’s the lowest operating margins have been on an adjusted and normalized basis in a long, long time.  As such, investors were spooked, and the stock dropped despite the double beat quarter. But, the drop wasn’t very significant. As of this writing, GOOG is off less than a percent on the day.  This relatively muted move in Google makes sense. Alphabet’s fourth-quarter-earnings report was some good and some bad.  On the good side, the near and long term revenue drivers remain very healthy. On the bad side, margins are falling almost everywhere, and profit growth is weak. The present valuation in Google accounts for big revenue growth and falling margins, and as such, this report should neither kill nor boost the stock.  Long term, though, the bull thesis looks compelling. It’s only a matter of time before Alphabet gets a handle on its cost structure and margin headwinds pass. When they do, margins will start to rebound.  As that happens, Alphabet will go from a sub-10% profit growth company, to a 10-20% profit growth company. That transition will ultimately push Google stock higher.  The Q4 earnings report simply signaled that this transition isn’t here yet. But, it also contained signs that such a transition could happen in 2019. As such, Google will likely remain range bound for the foreseeable future, but could break-out in later 2019 when margin headwinds reverse course.  The Good: Revenues Keep Rising  The good about Alphabet’s fourth quarter earnings report is that the company’s revenue drivers remain broadly healthy.  Total revenue growth in Q4 was 23%. That’s up slightly from last quarter (22%), down slightly from the year ago quarter (24%), and largely in-line with the growth rate over the past several years (20% to 25%).  In other words, despite increasing scale and tougher comps, Alphabet remains a 20%-plus growth company.  Resiliency in the company’s 20%-plus revenue growth rate can be traced to two things.  First, the digital ad business continues to benefit from a secular rise in digital engagement. As engagement becomes increasingly digitally-focused, more and more ad dollars flow into the digital channel.  As that has happened over the past several years, Alphabet’s digital ad revenues have consistently grow by 20% or more.  That growth rate slipped slightly under 20% in Q4, and the ad revenue business is slowing somewhat. But, not by all that much, and that’s impressive considering just how big this business is (over $130 billion in revenue on an annualized basis).  Clearly, advertisers continue to see the value in pumping money into the Google ecosystem, which is at the epicenter of everything consumers do on the internet.  Second, the company’s other growth businesses (namely, cloud and hardware) continue to grow at a healthy rate. There was some concern last quarter that Alphabet’s Other business segment slowed from 30%-plus growth in the first half of 2018, to sub-30% growth in the third quarter.  But, that was just a blip on the radar. Alphabet’s cloud and hardware businesses finished 2018 with tremendous momentum, and Other revenue growth re-accelerated above 30% in Q4.  Overall, the revenue growth drivers underlying Google stock remain healthy, and project to remain healthy for the foreseeable future.  The Bad: Margins Keep Falling  The bad about Alphabet’s fourth quarter earnings report is that margins continue to drop, and that’s diluting profit growth.  For the past several years, Alphabet has struggled with margin headwinds. Namely, traffic acquisition costs have been rapidly rising in the digital ad business due to a shift to mobile engagement.  Also, content acquisition costs for YouTube are going up, as are data center operating costs. It’s also worth noting that hardware businesses tend to have lower margins than software businesses, so continued strength in Alphabet’s hardware business is presumably a negative for the margin profile.  All these headwinds have converged to create persistent margin headaches for Alphabet. Those headaches continued in Q4. Operating margins dropped three points year-over-year to 21%.  That three-point year-over-year drop is fairly consistent with what has been reported over the past several quarters. But, the laps are getting easier. The net result is that operating margins in Q4 were the lowest they’ve been in a long, long time.  This margin compression is diluting profit growth. Revenues rose 23% in Q4. Operating profits rose just 7%. This has become the new norm for Google. A 20%-plus revenue growth rate has consistently trickled into a sub-10% profit growth rate.  Overall, the margin headwinds which have plagued GOOG over the past several quarters, stuck around in the fourth quarter, and significantly diluted profit growth.  The Bottom Line on Google Stock  Alphabet’s Q4 report underscored that this company remains a 20%-plus revenue growth, sub-10% profit growth company. That combination has led to range-bound trading in Google over the past year.  Thus, so long as Alphabet remains a 20%-plus revenue growth, sub-10% profit growth company, GOOG will remain stuck between $1,000 and $1,200.  Long term, it’s only a matter of time before margins rebound, Alphabet turns into a 10-20% profit growth company, and the stock breaks out. The drivers behind Alphabet’s margin headaches (the shift to mobile ads and expanding data center presence) will inevitably pass, and they could pass in 2019.  The shift to mobile is already mostly over, as the TAC rate in the quarter actually dropped slightly year-over-year. Meanwhile, capex growth is expected to slow meaningfully in 2019, and that will likely correlate with a drop in data center opex growth next year.  If TAC and data center opex growth both moderate in 2019, then margins will improve. If margins improve, Alphabet’s sub-10% profit growth rate will move towards 15%. As it does, Google stock will bounce higher.  Thus, it’s only a matter of time before Google stock roars to new highs. It won’t happen now because margins continue to fall. But, those margins could reverse course soon, and when they do, Google will take flight.  As of this writing, Luke Lango was long GOOG.<end_of_turn>

# Opinion | How British Feminism Became Anti-Trans

Last week, two British women stormed onto Capitol Hill in Washington for the purposes of ambushing Sarah McBride, the national press secretary of the Human Rights Campaign. Ms. McBride, a trans woman, had just been part of a meeting between the Parents for Transgender Equality National Council and members of Congress when the Britons — Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull, who goes by the name Posie Parker, and Julia Long — barged in. Heckling and misgendering Ms. McBride, the two inveighed against her supposed “hatred of lesbians” and accused her of championing “the rights of men to access women in women’s prison.” Ms. Parker, who live-streamed footage of the harassment on Facebook, contended that she had come to Washington because “this ideology” — by which she presumably meant simply being trans — “has been imported into the U.K. by America, so, to stem the flow of female erasure, we have to come to its source.” If the idea that transphobic harassment could be “feminist” bewilders you, you are not alone. In the United States, my adoptive home, the most visible contemporary opponents of transgender rights are right-wing evangelicals, who have little good to say about feminism. In Britain, where I used to live, the situation is different. There, the most vocal trans-exclusionary voices are, ostensibly, “feminist” ones, and anti-trans lobbying is a mainstream activity. Case in point: Ms. Parker told the podcast “Feminist Current” that she’d changed her thinking on trans women after spending time on Mumsnet, a site where parents exchange tips on toilet training and how to get their children to eat vegetables. If such a place sounds benign, consider the words of British writer Edie Miller: “Mumsnet is to British transphobia,” she wrote “what 4Chan is to American fascism.” The term coined to identify women like Ms. Parker and Ms. Long is TERF, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. In Britain, TERFs are a powerful force. If, in the United States, the mainstream media has been alarmingly ready to hear “both sides” on the question of trans people’s right to exist, in Britain, TERFs have effectively succeeded in framing the question of trans rights entirely around their own concerns: that is, how these rights for others could contribute to “female erasure.” Many prominent figures in British journalism and politics have been TERFs; British TV has made a sport of endlessly hosting their lurid rudeness and styling it as courage; British newspapers seemingly never tire of broadsides against the menace of “gender ideology.” (With time, the term TERF has become a catchall for all anti-trans feminists, radical or not.) The split between the American and British center-left on this issue was thrown into sharp relief last year, when The Guardian published an editorial on potential changes to a law called the Gender Recognition Act, which would allow people in Britain to self-define their gender. The editorial was headlined “Where Rights Collide,” and argued that “women’s concerns about sharing dormitories or changing rooms with ‘male-bodied’ people must be taken seriously.” Some of The Guardian’s United States-based journalists published a disavowal, arguing that the editorial’s points “echo the position of anti-trans legislators who have pushed overtly transphobic bathroom bills.” A curious facet of the groundswell of TERFism in Britain is that, in fact, the phenomenon was born in the United States. It emerged out the shattered remnants of the 1960s New Left, a paranoid faction of American 1970s radical feminism that the historian Alice Echols termed “cultural feminism” to distinguish it, and its wounded attachment to the suffering-based femaleness it purports to celebrate, from other strands of women’s liberation. The movement crossed over to Britain in the 1980s, when cultural feminism was among the lesbian-separatist elements of antinuclear protest groups who saw themselves as part of a “feminist resistance” to patriarchal science, taking a stand against nuclear weapons, test-tube babies and male-to-female transsexual surgery alike. In America, however, TERFism today is a scattered community in its death throes, mourning the loss of its last spaces, like the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival, which ended in 2015. And so the strangely virulent form that TERFism takes in Britain today, and its influence within the British establishment, requires its own separate, and multipronged, explanation. Ms. Parker and Ms. Long may not know it, but they’re likely influenced by the legacy of the British “Skepticism” movement of the 1990s and early 2000s, which mobilized against the perceived spread of postmodernism in English universities as well as homeopathy and so-called “junk science.” Hence, the impulse among TERFs to proclaim their “no-nonsense” character; witness the billboard Ms. Parker paid to have put up last fall dryly defining a woman as an “adult human female.” Such a posture positions queer theory and activism as individualistic, narcissistic and thus somehow fundamentally un-British. It’s also worth noting that the obsession with supposed “biological realities” of people like Ms. Parker are part of a long tradition of British feminism interacting with colonialism and empire. Imperial Britain imposed policies to enforce heterosexuality and the gender binary, while simultaneously constructing the racial “other” as not only fundamentally different, but freighted with sexual menace; from there, it’s not a big leap to see sexual menace in any sort of “other,” and “biological realities” as essential and immutable. (Significantly, many Irish feminists have rejected Britain’s TERFism, citing their experience of colonialism explicitly as part of the reason.) But perhaps the biggest factor in the rise of TERFism has been the relative dearth of social movements in Britain over the past three decades. It’s telling that Ms. Parker thinks it was the United States that exported “political correctness” and ideas like “gender identity” to Britain; it might even be fair to say that she’s right. In other parts of the world, including America, mass movements in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s around the effects of globalization and police brutality have produced long overdue dialogue on race, gender and class, and how they all interact. In Britain, however, the space for this sort of dialogue has been much more limited. As a result, middle- and upper-class white feminists have not received the pummeling from black and indigenous feminists that their American counterparts have, and thus, their perspectives retain a credibility and a level of influence in Britain that the Michigan Womyn’s Festival could have only dreamed of. Curiously, Ms. Parker and Ms. Long’s trans-Atlantic jaunt has led to a split in the ranks. Over the past few days, large segments of British TERFism have disowned both of them on social media for their Washington stunt, calling it an “ambush,” and them a “liability.” Whether Ms. Parker and Ms. Long went too far for a movement that, to date, seemingly has yet to hit a low, remains to be seen. It is revealing, however, where Ms. Parker feels she still has friends: On her same trip to Washington, the woman claiming to be a feminist, standing up for the rights of lesbians everywhere, made sure to drop by the right-wing Heritage Foundation. Sophie Lewis, a feminist theorist and geographer, is the author of the forthcoming “Full Surrogacy Now.”<end_of_turn>

# Neil Humphreys: Why Reds' wobble matters

Neil Humphreys: Why Reds' wobble matters Klopp's depleted side deserve better, so does the title race As ever, the sensible James Milner has helped to explain why this week seems so pivotal in the title race.  In terms of perspective, the Liverpool veteran offered both pleasure and pain.  Let's deal with the pleasure first. Should the Reds win their game in hand, they'll be top of the English Premier League table in mid-February, an unthinkable prospect in pre-season, when Manchester City were tipped to break more records than a youthful Usain Bolt.  But the pain comes with watching Milner toil as a makeshift right-back, the physical embodiment of the Freudian dream that we all have, the one about being unprepared for an exam, job or speech.  At West Ham, he was a 33-year-old midfielder with no pace being exposed by much younger men running past him at right-back. There was nowhere to hide.  Milner deserved better. And so does the title race.  Title winners do not usually prevail with a 33-year-old midfielder at right-back, no matter how committed. And Manchester City will not fear challengers forced to employ a 33-year-old midfielder at right-back.  And that's why Milner's comments are both perceptive and alarming. Liverpool should savour their current position, considering they are somehow sending out a wounded squad with more Band-Aids than a First Aid box.  Right now, it's hard to shrug the sense of foreboding that the closest title race in years might peter out by Easter, particularly when one examines the fixture list.  Once they've played Chelsea, City then face a generally benign run of games against mid-table mediocrity, whilst Liverpool will be thrown banana skins at Manchester United and Everton.  All of which makes the excited chatter of a Liverpool implosion more galling. Yes, City's return to form remains an aesthetic treat for the armchair viewer, but the Reds' recent stumbles are hardly a cause for celebration.  Liverpool's wobbles matter, for reasons other than their own.  Even United's zealots, those who'd rather see a gang of three-legged aardvarks lift the trophy than the Merseyside mob, should be careful what they wish for.  Apart from the obvious financial disparity between City and Liverpool - the Citizens' net spend over the last five seasons is around three times that of the Reds - a glance at their respective benches should sound the alarm.  Against West Ham United, Juergen Klopp had the option of bringing on the likes of Xherdan Shaqiri, Daniel Sturridge, Alberto Moreno and Divock Origi. How many of those names make City's bench?  Against Arsenal, Pep Guardiola had Fabian Delph, John Stones, Danilo, Riyad Mahrez, Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus to call upon. Now, how many of those expensive trinkets would make Liverpool's bench? Four? Five? All of them?  Whatever the exact numbers, they are entirely in favour of a club with a near inexhaustible supply of resources, from the subs bench to the staff canteen.  The chasm between the two sides was neatly illustrated by the way they have played and responded in recent weeks.  Guardiola has acknowledged that the title race could be decided by goal difference and encouraged his side to score more goals. So they knocked in three against Arsenal, just because they could.  Against West Ham, Liverpool had to force round pegs into square pegs and hope for the best.  With Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dejan Lovren and Joe Gomez missing, the gaps between Joel Matip and Milner were targeted and penetrated at West Ham.  Beyond chest-thumping and rowing with officials, Klopp had little else to offer. He knows the problems, but there are not enough solutions on his bench.  Liverpool didn't drop points against Leicester City and West Ham because they laboured under the weight of that 29-year-old monkey. They failed to win for more prosaic reasons. They looked shattered.  On the touchline, Klopp had the air of a runaway steam locomotive driver wondering if he had enough coal left to complete the journey.  In private moments of reflection, he probably doesn't know.  As Milner rightly pointed out, Liverpool have done exceptionally well to get this far. Should they falter again, however, City will disappear over the horizon.  And that's not really a race worth celebrating.

# Calistoga basketball roundup

If you were to ask any member of the Calistoga boys basketball team if a past version of the squad would have won a game with rock solid defense and free throws, they would think you were crazy. The 2018-2019 squad has been a program changing team, proved evermore on Saturday with the boys closing out a 43-36 victory over a potential playoff team in Ferndale. “I don’t think defense and holding a team to two points even belong in the same sentence when talking about past teams. A huge thing this season has been on defense and discipline,” Jasiel Flores said. “We are a small team, so we have to put more effort on the defensive end then other teams. We are starting to get to our potential, but we still need catch with the end of the season coming.” The Wildcats continue to improve on the defensive end, as the hosts held the visitors from Humboldt County to only 11 points in the second half. Flores led the way for Calistoga scoring a game-high 13 points with most of his damage coming after the halftime break. The game was close for the whole contest, as the two squads were tied after both the first and second quarters. Calistoga took a 36-34 advantage into the final frame and took over. “Watching a kid that some people may have given up on and seeing him blossom, that’s what makes coaching fun,” Calistoga coach Ray Particelli said. “I identified his love for the game and have taken his fire and passion in the right direction.” The fourth quarter was a monster moment for the program heading forward. Calistoga was rabid on defense, contesting every shot attempt by Ferndale to ensure that no easy looks were given up. The Wildcats from up north only scored two points in the quarter and those two points weren’t easy, as Lane Branstetter hit a falling-down, turn-around put back late in the quarter. Calistoga offense wasn’t humming either in the fourth quarter, but they took care of the ball and finished the game on the free throw line. With four different players all hitting free throws in the final minute to clinch the monumental win. “That truly was a marquee win for us,” Particelli said. “We finally have all our players and are finding some continuity and finally showing what we thought we were going to be showing this year.” After only winning two games last season the Wildcats may have a chance at the postseason this season, with the Ferndale victory being a glowing mark on their resume. Calistoga improves to 9-13 overall on the year and are importantly 6-3 versus Division 6 opponents. The main question will be if the Wildcats have a strong enough slate of victories to sneak into the field of 16. “It feels really good of much we have progressed from the beginning of the year to right now,” Christian Caldera said. “It shows that the work is paying off. We just have to keep doing it, because it keeps working.” In other results from the past week: Calistoga Boys 47, Roseland Collegiate Prep 39 Calistoga pulled off an impressive feat Friday evening, defeating Roseland Collegiate Prep 47-39 to complete a three-game season sweep of the Grizzlies from Santa Rosa. After losing their only meeting with the Grizzlies last season in their opener, 42-26, the Wildcats handled them 60-48 this December and again in January, 41-34. Caldera led the way this time with 12 points, 12 rebounds and four steals. “Coming off a two-win season and being the doormat, the program is starting to gain respect with these eight wins,” Particelli said after Friday’s game. “Even the teams that beat us have to beat us. We just don’t mail it in.” Roseland Collegiate Prep took its only lead of the game in the opening minutes, 4-3, but the hosts quickly bounced back on an 8-0 run. Calistoga led 15-13 after the first quarter, but it was the second quarter that sealed the victory for the Wildcats. They held the Grizzlies to three points in the frame to take a 32-16 lead into the halftime break. Senior small forward Cesar Ayala was huge in the first half, scoring 11 of his game-high 14 points, and the Wildcats were tight on Roseland Collegiate Prep star Alex Rizo. The senior, who had scored 25 points in the first meeting of the season, had zero points at halftime before ended up with a team-high 14. Calistoga received solid showings from Joey Russo (10 points) and Flores (nine), and outrebounded Roseland Collegiate Prep 37-17. Calistoga Girls 57, Roseland Collegiate Prep 10 The girls game didn’t take nearly as long to decide, as the Wildcats led 14-0 before the Grizzlies got on the board. But Particelli wasn’t exactly please with Calistoga’s effort. “We were pretty casual to start the game, but we got a wake-up call at halftime,” Particelli said. “It’s not about winning, it’s about us playing the best game that we can. I was happy about our performance in the second half.” Calistoga (11-9, 3-3 NCL IV) needs to win only one of its final three games to have the .500 record or better needed to reach the postseason. “We tell the girls all the time that you can’t just turn on the switch,” Particelli said. “Against a good team, if you play a sluggish first half, then you are done. We talked about that a little at halftime.” Litzy Infante led the Wildcats with a game-high 20 points while pulling down four rebounds, and fellow junior guard Vanesa Queipo added 13 points while grabbing nine rebounds and snatching eight steals. Junior post player Laila Elkeshen was solid off the bench, scoring 10 points and pulling down nine rebounds. The Grizzlies were in trouble from the start. Main scorer Lindsey Arellano injured her wrist early and, noticeably bothered by it for the remainder of the contest, finished with a team-high three points. Roseland Collegiate Prep committed 36 turnovers for the game and was outrebounded 38-16. “For Division 6, we are a formidable team and it is going to take a good team to beat us,” Particelli said. “We play great defense, especially at the Division 6 level.”<end_of_turn>

# Surrey teen musician earns accolades at L.A. talent convention - Cloverdale Reporter

Surrey teen Ashley Pater has returned from Los Angeles with some accolades.  She was an award winner in a singing competition and first runner-up in songwriting during last month’s International Model & Talent Convention.  The Fraser Heights-area talent is gunning for a career in music, and frequently performs at local events.  “Last year Ashley had over 100 performances in the Lower Mainland and has won local talent events,” agent Dale Harding, of White Rock-based Pizzazz International School of Personal Development, said in a release.  “She is receiving a lot of interest from the music industry in Nashville. Ashley is currently considering whom she will sign with.”   — John Pater (@MrJonyP) January 9, 2019 Pater’s “Red Sneakers” song is entered in the 2019 Searchlight contest, CBC Music ’s annual hunt for Canada’s undiscovered musical talent.  “She’s a storyteller,” says a post on ashleypater.com. “Through her music she expresses feelings and moments that we can all relate to. In every song, Ashley always finds a way to get true meaning across to her listeners, while creating a forever ear worm.”  Last April, Pater celebrated her 15th birthday with the release of a five-song EP, Wild Roses, and a performance at Surrey City Hall’s Centre Stage theatre. At the time, she was a Grade 9 student at Fraser Heights Secondary.  The tunes were recorded at Four Destinations studio, or 4D, in North Vancouver with the North Delta-based duo of bass player Conor Brennan and guitarist Connor Neidig.  Pater has been performing music since age nine, and has focused on writing her own songs.  At Centre Stage, she described her unique songwriting techniques for an audience of family, friends and new fans.  ”I’ll stand in front of a mirror and I’ll use a dry-erase marker – not a Sharpie because my mom would kill me – to write lyrics all over it until completely filled and I have my song,” Ashley explained. “And the other way, which I tend to do more often now, is I’ll get a notebook and I’ll start drawing pictures. I’m not the best artist so sometimes I don’t really know what I’m drawing, but I make sense of it and turn it into a song.”  Locally, Pater recently performed during a Vancouver Giants hockey game at Langley Events Centre and also at the Art of Lights lantern festival at Cloverdale’s Bill Reid Millennium Amphitheatre.<end_of_turn>

# What’s to become of haunting new shipwreck lodged in sands off NC’s Outer Banks?

Visitors to Cape Hatteras National Seashore this week have been given a concrete reminder of why the coast off North Carolina is called the “Graveyard of the Atlantic.”  Locked in the sand off Cape Point is the haunting mast-like rigging of the trawler Big John, which mysteriously flipped over Monday and broke apart, spreading hazardous wreckage debris for a mile. Three crewman survived.  The debris on the beach has been removed, but the tough-to-reach rigging remains offshore days later, looking like the foundered brigantine.  What’s to become of it?  Sign Up and Save  Get six months of free digital access to The Charlotte Observer  #ReadLocal  The National Park Service told the Charlotte Observer Friday that it has decided not to leave the wreckage as a curiosity piece for tourists visiting Cape Hatteras National Seashore.  “The remaining parts of this particular shipwreck are scheduled to be removed from the beach by (Friday) afternoon,” Cape Hatteras spokesman Mike Barber told the Observer.  A company out of Beaufort was hired to remove the rigging and take it away.  Barber didn’t say where the wreckage would end up, but the ocean off the Outer Banks is notorious for being a final resting place for more than 2,000 shipwrecks. Bulldozers were being used to haul the wreckage off, according to photos sent from the park service.  In some areas, blockade runners from the Civil War and retired World War II troop transport ships can actually be seen sticking out of the water at low tide.  In others cases, century-old shipwrecks are revealed when storms peal away beach sands, revealing old schooners ships buried underneath.  The “unusually large number of shipwrecks” is due to Cape Hatters’ location at a spot where warm Gulf Stream waters collide with the Arctic Current, explains NCPedia.org. The result is a treacherous spot where sands constantly shift and ships can easily run aground, says the site.  Included in some of the shipwrecks is treasure waiting to be found.  Over the past two years, the shipwreck exploration groups Blue Water Ventures International and Endurance Exploration Group have found hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gold coins from two wrecks off the Carolinas.<end_of_turn>

# Braintree mayor emphasizes planning

In his "State of the Town" speech, Mayor Joseph Sullivan emphasized the benefits of planning.  BRAINTREE − The words "planning" or "plan" appeared almost two dozen times in Mayor Joseph Sullivan's annual "State of the Town" speech. Addressing the town council and an audience dominated by elected officials and department heads Thursday night at town hall, Sullivan said the planning is fundamental to his approach to governing and is shown in what town government has accomplished over the past 11 years. He cited the town's financial strength, the school's academic performance, as well as investments in road improvements and municipal and school buildings as the result of this planning. "We have built a very sturdy and sustainable future for our town, and we have done all this while offering the lowest residential tax rate in the region," Sullivan said. The mayor said the proposed update of the town's zoning ordinances and a revised zoning map is an effort to preserve the town's quality of life and retain control of its future. He said critics of the proposal have called it an invitation for more development in the town. "In fact, our goal is just the opposite," Sullivan said. "It is to manage the growth of our town." Sullivan did say there is a need for more housing in the town, particularly for long-time and younger residents who want to stay in the town. He said the town is a desirable place to live. He is expecting a proposal for a housing development for those age 55 and over sometime this year. The town has also proposed a zoning change which would allow "transit-oriented development" in areas near the Braintree MBTA station. "Let me be clear, our future steps in the planning of our town is to preserve the residential climate of our existing neighborhoods while providing 21st century housing opportunities," he said. One of the few times the speech was interrupted by applause was when Sullivan declared the town's opposition to a proposed natural gas compressor station on the Fore River in Weymouth. He said this is the most important fight to protect the quality of life on the South Shore. "We must stand in opposition to this ill-considered proposal," he said. He also announced the police department and Manet Community Health Center will offer a new program aimed at preventing fatal overdoses and minimizing family stress. The department has also formed a "Family Services Unit." The new unit, headed by Police Sgt. James Mosesso, is tasked with working with problems related to children, elders, domestic violence, sexual assault and mental health, said Police Chief Paul Shastany. Sullivan also noted the town's efforts to deal with traffic issues, from the hiring of a traffic engineer to working with neighborhood groups on traffic calming measures. He also said there have been initial discussions with Lime Bikes on offering a bike sharing program in the town.<end_of_turn>

# Everything you need to know about the Alton Towers Dungeon

Thrill-seekers looking forward to the new season on Alton Towers are in for a an extra special treat after announcing the opening date for a new attraction.  The Alton Towers Dungeon is to open on the first day of the season - March 23 - with the Towers describing the new attraction as 'a hilariously hideous journey through Staffordshire’s darkest history'.  The Dungeon - a 45 minute experience which includes five actor-led shows and a hideously scary boat ride - is recommended for guests over the age of ten and will use a combination of interactive shows, live actors and cutting edge theming and technology.  A spokesman for Alton Towers said: "Guests will be screaming with laughter whilst being sentenced by the Bishop of Stafford, surviving the plague, enduring the Torturer and also making a stop at the Witch of Burslem’s haunted cottage.  "The Alton Towers Dungeon will draw on the best of the Dungeons’ brand and apply Alton Towers’ expertise in family entertainment to bring to life some of the spookiest tales from the local area."  Meanwhile theme park bosses have launched a major recruitment drive across the UK to find a guest experience host for the Dungeon.  It says those who apply need to be a scoundrel at heart, cause outrage to a confident level, be a personality-driven performer who inspires revulsion and be able to work comfortably surrounded by rats (both literally and personified).  The targeted adverts are focused on reaching existing workers whose roles may mirror the horrible specifications required. Adverts have been placed at parliament, outside a popular social media company HQ in London and in spots where people enjoy a Good Morning Breakfast.  The job advert says: "Ask yourself these questions:  Are you a scoundrel at heart? When you walk into a room, can the tension be cut with a knife? Do your friends often say that you can’t be trusted? Do you even have any friends at all? "This is a truly unique opportunity to join the team at the Alton Towers Dungeon, a brand new attraction launching at Alton Towers Resort this March. This specially created role will see the appointed individual be responsible for ‘atmosphere balancing’ – countering guests’ enjoyable experience with outrageous behaviour in order to create an inhospitable and tense environment.  "To the wrong candidate, this could be the worst job imaginable. To the right candidate, one who displays traits of repulsiveness, who revels in being mischievous, and who has a penchant for the dark side of life – this could be the best job in the world.  "Does this sound like it could be you…?"  The Dungeon will open on March 23 when the theme park opens for the new season and advance tickets cost £5 by booking online here or £7.50 on the day. Entry is free for Alton Towers 2019 Premium Season Pass holdrs and g uests will be booked into a specific timeslot of their choice.  Application deadline is the Alton Towers Dungeon opening weekend (Saturday, March 23) and details should be sent to DungeonJob@alton-towers.com .

# First Look: 2020 Range Rover Evoque

LONDON — OK, it might be more than a slight oversimplification to say that Jaguar Land Rover’s design team, assigned the second generation of the compact-sized Range Rover Evoque at, say, 9 a.m., had it knocked off by 3 p.m. in time to get home for afternoon tea. But they had a far easier task than those who penned the original; this new version of the successful and stylish crossover — global sales of more than 772,000 since its debut in 2010 — is very much an evolutionary reworking, particularly to the untrained eye. “The Evoque has such a distinctive DNA that people love,” notes Gerry McGovern, Land Rover’s chief design officer. “We had to make (the new one) better without disturbing that DNA.” This means the upcoming — arriving at dealerships late spring — 2020 model is, first, instantly recognizable as an Evoque thanks to the retention of distinctive sloped roofline and rising belt line, key identifiers of the crossover specifically and the brand generally. And second, it is extremely attractive, with an almost Tesla-like design simplicity to its profile, accentuated by flush door handles (first seen on the Velar) and side mouldings, tighter panel gaps, pronounced “shoulders” and wheel arches that, in addition to the optional 21-inch wheels, connote an intentional athletic dynamism. The introduction of new slim LED headlights and taillights are the most noticeable departures from the first Evoque. There’s more familiarity than not under the hood as well, with one noteworthy addition. Power is still provided by an updated, quieter and less thirsty version of the turbocharged 2.0L four-cylinder Ingenium gas engine, now offered in both mild and caliente strengths. The Evoque P250 gets 246 horsepower, while the P300 sees the turbo-four goosed to 296 horsepower. Both engines are mated to a nine-speed ZF automatic transmission. In addition, the P300 comes fitted with a 48-volt mild-hybrid (MHEV) powertrain to go along with the gas engine. The MHEV powertrain is a first for Land Rover and works by harvesting energy that’s normally lost during deceleration thanks to the engine-mounted, belt-integrated starter generator — replacing the traditional alternator — storing it in the under-floor battery. At speeds below 17 km/h, the engine is designed to shut off while the brakes are applied. When pulling away, the stored energy is redeployed to assist the engine under acceleration. Although not scheduled for Canada at this time, some markets will see a full plug-in electric version of the crossover late in 2019. A 1.5L three-cylinder gas engine is assisted by an 11.3 kWh lithium-ion battery pack in conjunction with a 107-horsepowe electric motor. With metrics showing many current Evoque owners being both “tech savvy” and environmentally aware, Land Rover is forecasting that 90 per cent of the new model will be either PHEV or MHEV versions. The sheet metal might look familiar but the body structure beneath is all new, or at least 99.9 per cent. Apparently, only the door hinges are carried over from the previous model. Dimensionally, the 2020 model is almost identical to the current Evoque, though there’s more interior space than before thanks to Land Rover’s new — and stiffer by 13 per cent — Premium Transverse Architecture. A longer wheelbase yields 21 millimetres of extra rear knee room. The cargo area is six per cent larger (a total of 591 litres, or 20.9 cu.-ft.) than that of the previous model as well as wider, with capacity increasing to 1,430 litres (50.5 cu.-ft.) when the 40/20/40-split second-row seats are folded. The Evoque is all-wheel-drive-only and comes with standard driveline disconnect. Combined with the second-generation Active Driveline (standard on P300 models) and the optional Adaptive Dynamics feature, Land Rover says the Evoque is designed to deliver the optimum balance of comfort and agility. For more adverse conditions, the standard Terrain Response 2 system is designed to automatically detect the surface being driven on, adjusting the vehicle’s driving characteristics accordingly. Should fording streams be your thing, know that the new Evoque can also now wade through water up to 600 millimeters, up from the previous 500. And wouldn’t you know it, Land Rover had us doing just that, the company setting up a tight obstacle course through an old railway station in the heart of London. Squeezing through a series of tight archways, we navigated steep on- and off-ramps, a length of railway track, an angled track that pitched us precariously on our side and finished it off by driving into a swimming pool filled with a more than a foot of water. In addition to testing the Evoque’s agility — which, naturally, it aced — it allowed us to check out the ClearSight rear-view mirror that transforms into an HD video screen when engaged. When passengers or bulky items compromise rear visibility, a flip of a switch on the underside of the mirror causes a camera feed from the top of the Evoque to display what is behind it in high definition. The screen provides a 50-degree field of vision and enhances visibility in low light. In addition, the new Evoque features ClearSight Ground View technology, which allows the driver to virtually see through the hood and under the front end of the vehicle by projecting a 180-degree view of the ground onto the upper touchscreen — particularly useful when negotiating tight parking spaces or parking next to a high curb. Inside, designers reworked the cabin with a minimalist yet digital aspect in mind. With a thought to sustainability, alternatives to the usual leather include “technical” seat textiles such as a Kvadrat wool blend and Dinamica suedecloth, as well as a eucalyptus textile and Ultrafabrics that use natural materials and recycled plastics. Incorporated technologies include the optional twin-touchscreen InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment system, 16-way adjustable front seats and cabin air ionization. Utility comes in the form of a large centre console with twin sliding armrests, doors that can now accommodate 1.5-litre water bottles, and storage behind the lower touchscreen that can hold small items such as cellphones. There is smartphone integration with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as optional Click & Go rear-seat tablet holders with charging capability, a 4G WiFi hotspot for up to eight devices and six USB slots located throughout the cabin. The original Evoque broke new ground for Land Rover, but is now past its “best before” date. The second-generation version is all shiny new and stands ready to take its place, continuing the brand’s longstanding off-road reputation in compact form while advancing its urban utility with a fresh yet familiar look and a host of smart features. For the Canadian market, the 2020 Evoque will be offered in the following trims: P250 — S, SE and First Edition; P300 MHEV — R-Dynamic S, R-Dynamic SE and R-Dynamic HSE. Additional details, including pricing, will be announced at the 2019 Montreal Auto Show in January. The 2019 Evoque currently has a base price of $49,900.<end_of_turn>

# Unai Emery employing an analyst to help improve Alex Iwobi's end product

Alex Iwobi has revealed he is working closely with a performance analyst in a bid to improve his erratic end product.  The Nigeria international has featured prominently this season with Unai Emery a fan of his ball carrying ability and running power.  Iwobi, who made his Premier League debut four years ago, has scored two goals this season and provided two assists but continues to be criticised for his decision making, particularly in the final third.  The 22-year-old was at fault for Manchester City’s opening goal in last weekend’s 3-1 defeat at the Etihad, but he insists he is making rapid progress as he bids to cement a regular first team place.  ‘This season I feel much better and I feel like I’m in control, especially going forward in an attacking sense,’ Iwobi told Arsenal Player. ‘I have an analyst now who is always trying to help me, which I didn’t have in seasons before, so he’s sending me clips and saying what I can do better.  ‘That’s helped me and I’d like to say I’ve been involved in a few goals this season, even it’s not the assist or the goal, I’ve been getting a few pre-assists which go unnoticed. But at the end of the day as long as the team does well, that’s my main concern.  ‘I would say each day I’m still growing and still learning, but negatives, obviously they’re always going to criticise me for my goals and assists, which I need to add to my game if I want to be compared with the people I’m playing with.  ‘The main thing is just to remain calm. We’ve even been doing some mental work to remain calm under pressure and calm when I’m on the pitch, and this is something I’ve been working on, not just in football but also off the pitch as well.  ‘Now I’ve done it I look back and it wasn’t easy, especially with the things I had to go through, so I can always say it’s going to be hard, but the rewards are definitely worth it.  ‘What’s next? Life is like a movie, you have to stay tuned. I can’t really predict what’s going to happen. We will have to wait and see. All I know is that playing for Arsenal to me is always going to be an honour. I’m always proud to represent this club and wear the badge.’<end_of_turn>

# 5 juveniles charged with fatally shooting Nashville musician

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Police say five juveniles in Tennessee are charged with fatally shooting a Nashville musician.  News outlets report police charged three girls ages 12, 14 and 15, and two boys, ages 13 and 16, with criminal homicide in the death of 24-year-old Kyle Yorlets. Police said in a statement that the Belmont graduate was fatally shot outside his home Thursday afternoon.  Authorities say it appears that the juveniles were in a stolen pickup truck in an alley that runs behind Yorlets’ home. Police say the youths saw him outside and took his wallet and told him to hand over the keys to his vehicle. Police say they think Yorlets was shot because he refused.  Yorlets was a member of the Nashville-based band Carverton. The band said in a statement that they were shocked and heartbroken.<end_of_turn>

# Depression 101: Dallas students learn about mental health in the classroom

Depression 101: Dallas students learn about mental health in the classroom  DALLAS (AP) — In a scenario playing out in more and more classrooms around the world, a Dallas teenager recently asked her classmate if anything was wrong, noting that she hadn’t been acting like herself. The brusque reply: “Just leave me alone.”  The ninth-graders at the Uplift Hampton Preparatory school were role-playing as part of a program that aims to teach teens how to spot the signs of depression in themselves and others. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among Americans ages 10 to 18, according to government health statistics, and experts hope the lessons will get help to depressed teens more quickly.  “It’s kind of like ‘Mental Health 101.’ So they talk about depression and anxiety and just common mental health issues, and then I think the most important thing is they talk about what to do if you feel that way,” said Tony Walker, senior director of student support services at Uplift Education, which offers the program to all ninth-graders at its network of Dallas-area public charter schools, including Uplift Hampton.  The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center is administering the program, which is called Youth Aware of Mental Health and was developed by researchers at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Columbia University in New York.  UT Southwestern researcher Marshall Motsenbocker, who led the program’s five 45-minute sessions at Uplift Hampton, said role-playing helps teens talk through difficult issues. When the two girls finished their recent scene, he asked the class what signs of depression they recognized and what might be causing it. He said teens are sometimes too quick to act, and these discussions help them pause to think about what might have motivated someone to behave a certain way.  Destinie Medina, who participated in the sessions at Uplift Hampton, said it’s important to know how to help someone who has depression or suicidal thoughts. She said she also learned “what might cause depression, like what’s the difference between depression and sadness.”  Classmate Jose Perales said he learned that sometimes helping means “you just have to listen to what they have to say and how they feel.”  Research on the program has shown encouraging results. A study published in the medical journal Lancet in 2015 found that it reduced the number of suicide attempts and severe suicidal thoughts of those who went through it.  Interest in the program has increased since then, with some schools in Sweden, Australia, India, England and the U.S. now offering it, said Camilla Wasserman, a Karolinska Institute researcher who helped create the program. She said one of its strengths is that it encourages discussion.  “We don’t really believe in right or wrong answers and we explore all types of situations,” Wasserman said.  This is the third year UT Southwestern has offered the program. It’s reached more than 18,000 students in that time and is currently in more than 30 Dallas-area schools.  Dr. Madhukar Trivedi, who oversees the program and conducts research on depression at the university, said assessments of students before and after completing the program shows they improve their knowledge of what to do when someone needs help and that their own symptoms of depression and anxiety decrease.  Trivedi said that to allay any concerns that parents might have, including the “unfortunate misperception” that talking to teens about depression might make them depressed, parents are invited to an informational session.  One area school district turned to the program two years ago after a string of suicides.  “Our counselors have reported that they see a lot more students who come in concerned about their own health or someone else as a result of this program,” said Jana Hancock, director of guidance and family education services for the Plano Independent School District. She noted that the program is designed for everyone — not just those who might be experiencing issues.  Youth Aware of Mental Health is just one of the programs used to teach teens about mental health. The National Alliance on Mental Illness created a 50-minute program called Ending the Silence that teaches students the warning signs of mental health problems. It has reached almost 450,000 kids in 41 states since the organization started offering it nationally in 2014, said Jennifer Rothman, the group’s senior manager for youth and young adult initiatives.  New York and Virginia, meanwhile, recently passed laws requiring such lessons.  “It was an idea, frankly, whose time had come,” said Glenn Liebman, CEO of the Mental Health Association in New York State, Inc., a mental health advocacy group that spent several years pushing for the legislation before it passed.<end_of_turn>

# Shashi Tharoor alleges Arnab Goswami 'stole' confidential docs in Sunanda Pushkar case; Delhi court orders FIR against journo, Republic TV - Firstpost

New Delhi: A Delhi court has ordered registration of an FIR against news channel Republic TV and its editor Arnab Goswami on a complaint of Congress leader Shashi Tharoor alleging theft of confidential documents pertaining to the probe into his wife Sunanda Pushakar's death.  Metropolitan Magistrate Dharmender Singh, in his 21 January order that was uploaded on Friday, directed the SHO concerned to lodge the FIR and investigate the matter which required a probe as it is not clear how the material came in the possession of the accused persons.  "This court is of the considered view that in view of allegations levelled by Tharoor and material produced on record in the form of RTI replies and other material, matter discloses commission of cognisable offence and in view of this court, matter requires investigation by police as it is not clear how said material came in the possession of proposed accused persons.  "This court is of the further view that number of persons are to be examined in this matter. In these circumstances, SHO concerned is directed to register FIR in this matter and investigate the same as per law," the court said and posted the matter for further hearing on 4 April," the court said.  Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Tharoor, had told the court that during the investigation of the death case, police collected a number of items or materials of the deceased and recorded statement of complainant and one of his aides Narain Singh. All those documents and materials were part of confidential record and within the sole possession of the investigation team.  It added that the accused persons "in an attempt to increase the viewership of their news channel deliberately made malicious and defamatory remarks against complainant".  The court noted that Tharoor has already started legal action against the news channel and Goswami before the Delhi High Court for alleged defamatory accusation.  "It is alleged that during several broadcast on said news channel, which was conducted by proposed accused persons, certain documents were shown on news channel which were stated to be documents related to investigation of the death of complainant's wife.  "Such documents are a copy of internal file notings of Delhi Police, copy of statement of complainant given to Delhi Police, copy of statement of complainant's aide Narain Singh, pictures of deceased which were taken during autopsy," the complaint said. It alleged that these confidential documents were "illegally accessed" and "shown/broadcast on their news channel".  "It is alleged that accused persons accessed the complainant's email account without his authority or consent and shared the personal emails on their news channel. It is submitted that accused persons even filed said materials/ documents as part of their reply in civil suit before high court," the complaint said.  The complainant cited the RTI queries received from the Delhi Police, which said "it is not permissible to share the information/ documents related to any investigation to any public member/media till the case is pending investigation."  "It is submitted that above said RTI replies by Public Information Officer of Police authorities clearly shows that proposed accused persons accessed the above mentioned documents illegally. It is submitted that complainant filed the complaint with police regarding theft of those documents/ materials and regarding hacking of his e-mail account.  "However, no action has been taken by police. So, present application was filed with request to pass direction for registration of FIR and investigation of this matter," the complaint said.  Tharoor, former Union minister and Pushkar's husband, has been charged under sections 498-A (husband or his relative subjecting a woman to cruelty) and 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), but has not been arrested in the case.  Pushkar was found dead in a suite of a luxury hotel in the city on the night of 17 January, 2014. The couple were staying in the hotel as the official bungalow of Tharoor was being renovated at that time.

# Details from Central African Republic rebel deal released

BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) — An agreement signed by Central African Republic and 14 rebel groups earlier this week will see the dissolution of armed groups, the formation of an inclusive government and the creation of a fund for victims who have suffered in years of conflict, according to the accord seen Friday.  The agreement signed Wednesday is the eighth since the fighting began in 2013 but the first to emerge from direct dialogue. The 30-page peace deal, negotiated in Sudan and titled the Political Accord for Peace and Reconciliation, evokes four main points: victims, justice, peace and national reconciliation.  Armed groups undertake to respect the legitimacy of the country’s institutions and to renounce the use of arms and violence.  The government will set up a Truth, Justice, Reparation and Reconciliation Commission within 90 days.<end_of_turn>

# Fans mourning the impending closure of a longtime Winfield restaurant

A restaurant popular in the Wellington/Winfield area for the past three decades is closing later this month. Neives’ Mexican Restaurant owner Judy McCreary said the last day in business for her Mexican restaurant, which has operated at 119 E. Ninth Street in Winfield since 2001, will be Feb. 23. Neives, who moved the restaurant to Winfield 18 tears ago after a 15-year run in nearby Wellington, said she is ready to retire and spend more time with her six grandchildren. McCreary, who added a mobile taco truck to her business last year, says she will keep it going. She’s a member of the Wichita Food Truck Coalition and is often in Wichita serving her signature flour tacos from the truck. She said she plans to offer the empty restaurant space up for banquets and private events and will send the dining room furniture to Tulsa, where her daughter has a restaurant. As word has spread about her plans to close, McCreary said, she’s heard from many distressed longtime fans. “I’m getting a lot of messages from my customers,” she said. “It really has been great, but it’s time for me to retire and spend time with my grand kids.” Sign Up and Save  Get six months of free digital access to The Wichita Eagle  #ReadLocal<end_of_turn>

# Teenager lands music scholarship at Shropshire college

Advertising  Teenager lands music scholarship at Shropshire college  A classically trained teenage soprano has landed a music scholarship at Ellesmere College  Sixth Form student Rhian Jones, 17, was presented with the Walker Music Scholarship at Ellesmere College after a private performance of three songs in the College’s Chapel.  The scholarship was created by Tom and Margaret Walker as a thank you for the education of their own two children Rachael and Edward.  The scholarship will run for two years supporting Rhian through the Sixth Form and providing her with financial support and mentoring connections to the global network of 7,000 Old Ellesmerians around the world.  Rhian, who hails from Mold, said: “I would like to thank Mr and Mrs Walker for this kind award.  “I am thoroughly enjoying my time at Ellesmere and am incredibly grateful for the opportunity that I have been granted.  “The support I have received from both the House staff and tutors has been amazing, it’s like a home from home.  “I have some very inspiring teachers and I hope, with lots of hard work and determination, that I can achieve my ambition of studying Music at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire or the Royal Welsh College of Music.”  Rhian is the third student to be awarded the Walker Music Scholarship following Stuart Green, who went on to study Maths at Imperial College London, and Seren Devismes, who is now studying at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire.  Nick Pettingale, Director of External Relations at Ellesmere College, added: “I don’t believe you can overstate the value and power of these scholarships.  “I meet many Old Ellesmerians who wish to make a difference and express their gratitude to the school, which contributed to their own success, by giving something back.”  Advertising<end_of_turn>

# ‘High Flying Bird’ Review: Steven Soderbergh’s Got Game

Ray Burke (Andre Holland) talks a great game. If verbiage was a professional sport, the man would be rocking MVP rings, adorning Wheaties boxes, have his own sneaker line. Kids would be wearing his jersey. He’s first-round Hall-of-Famer material when it comes to pitching clients, charming “the naysayers and the hate-swayers,” power-chatting his way out of tight spots. And Burke, a sports agent with a whole gift shop’s worth of gab, happens to be in a bit of a sticky situation at the moment. The NBA is six months into a lockout. The administrative bigwigs and the players-association reps are waiting see who blinks first. Ray’s star rookie, a basketball phenom named Erick Scott (Melvin Gregg; remember this name), is stuck between making his league debut and limbo. No one’s balling. No one’s getting paid. Some folks may be getting fired. Desperate times.   Only Ray, he’s got this idea, see. It’s crazy, but it might work. Just sit tight, he tells Erick. The agent hands the young man a book in sealed manila envelope, says it’s “the Bible”; don’t open it yet, he counsels. You’ll know when you’ll need it. Then Ray walks back to his downtown office a dozen-or-so city blocks away — can’t take a cab when your expense-account credit card has been shut off — and begins to plot. The longer he walks past all those skyscrapers, each a monument to man’s ingenuity and ambition, the more he starts to see that yes, there is an alternative. This is how revolutions start, with disruption. And who better to make a movie about disruption than a real-life disruptor?  Now two TV gigs (including one that started as a choose-your-own-adventure app) and three movies into a post-“retirement” third-wind renaissance, Steven Soderbergh isn’t just refusing to slow down — he’s ramping up as fast as he can, and the more rules he can break the better. And as his latest High Flying Bird demonstrates, the combination of nimbleness and outrage suits him oh-so-well. A collaboration between the filmmaker, The Knick star Holland and playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney (who penned the source material for Moonlight), this deft, exhilarating takedown of professional sports and corporate strangleholds suggests that remaking the rules of the game is only the beginning. The power, the movie says, doesn’t rest solely in the hands of late-capitalist masters. It belongs to the players — and to paradigm-skewing artists looking to stir shit up.   What Ray realizes is that, while the NBA essentially owns these young men who go from college draft pick to new kid on the court, there are loopholes to be utilized as leverage. So let’s say, for example, Erick and his future teammate Jamero (Justin Hurtt-Dunkley), who’ve been publicly beefing on social media, were to somehow show up at the same place, i.e. the annual charity event held by a local basketball coach/neighborhood figurehead (the mighty Bill Duke). Maybe Burke’s assistant Sam (Atlanta‘s Zasie Beetz, invaluable) can whisper sweet nothings into the young client’s ear about how he’s destined for greatness. Maybe the agent plays up the rivalry by working on the ego of Jamero’s protective mother (Jeryl Prescott). Maybe words will be exchanged, gauntlets thrown down, an impromptu one-on-one grudge match goaded into existence.  And then what if partial clips of this co-ordinated “off-the-cuff” showdown, viewed by some 45 million viewers online who are hungry for action — and filmed on phones similar to the exact same iPhone that Soderbergh himself shot this movie on, under the nom de cinematography Peter Andrews — could be presented as proof that broadcasting rights, league-sanctioned tournaments, shot-calling muckety-mucks, et al., are superfluous? “I’m taking a meeting with Netflix,” Burke says at one point, wielding the notion of a runaround via livestreaming player-run pick-up games like a threat. That would be the Netflix, by the way, that’s also underwriting the movie you’re watching, perhaps even on their service at home instead of inside a theater. At which point, the glare from the hall of mirrors becomes momentarily blinding and you realize that High Flying Bird isn’t really about sports at all.  Or rather it isn’t just about sports, which is partially what makes this whipsmart, wickedly subversive satire so incredible even if you don’t care about draft picks and point spreads. Yes, there are interludes of players like Reggie Jackson, Karl-Anthony Towns and Donovan Mitchell talking to the camera about challenges they faced during their respective rookie years. You get lots of inside-baseball back-and-forth — apologies for mixing sports references here — about the industry between Burke and the players-association negotiator, played by The Wire‘s Sonja Sohn with her signature don’t-waste-my-time-with-your-bullshit steeliness. Zachary Quinto’s boss shows up occasionally to fret over the state of their firm and Kyle MacLachlan personifies the reptilian sleaziness of a rich, rotten one-percenter owner.   But Soderbergh and McCraney are after bigger game, or more specifically, what Duke’s sagely old-timer refers to as “a game on top of a game.” (Tellingly, you never witness Erick and Jamero actually square off; the movie cuts away after the first dribble.) They understand that pro sports is but one arena where exploitation and inequity is the law of the land, and that anyone with eyeballs can suss out the racial disparity between the owners and the players. What the world needs are folks who are willing not to accept any of this as a given, who can buck systems.  In other words, it needs a Ray Burke, who Holland turns into a motormouthed smooth operator and a MVP visionary in a middle-management suit. It’s a cliché to talk about actors who let you see the character thinking, but even Ray’s reaction shots are like a Mozart symphony of whirling cerebral motors. It needs a McCraney, who has a knack for setting up one two-to-three-person conversation after another yet never letting you feel like you’re watching showcases; knows how to embed high-conceptual arguments in the mouths of fleshed-out characters; and can balance rhetorical questions with quotable lines. (“To move merch and sell sneakers, they need your service,” Burke says, laying out the symbiotic relationship between employee, employer and consumer in one fell swoop.)  And it needs a Soderbergh, who invests this tale of outrunning and outgunning organizations — be they sports leagues or studios tied to old distribution/exhibition models — with a sense of energy, verve and mischievous glee. Restless would be too mild a word for his guerilla camerawork here; following Burke, Erick, Sam and everyone else down city streets and office hallways, through backroom deals and backseat powwows, around neighborhood gyms and fancy business lunches will leave you a bit dizzy. He gives you a vibrant all-talk symposium on the economic bubble of Sports Inc. that’s ready to burst and an Altman film minus the overlapping lip service. It’s not a coincidence that the movie is named after a Richie Havens protest song, or that the singer’s anthem “Handsome Johnny” plays over the climax, in which we finally find out what “the Bible” is. It’s too good a mic-drop moment to spoil here. You just need to see it — all of it — for yourself. The ball’s in your court.<end_of_turn>

# Gulfport boys soccer wins back-to-back 6A state championship

GULFPORT, MS (WLOX) - The Gulfport boys soccer team looked to defend their title against Northwest Rankin Saturday night.

In the second half, senior player Joseph Cumberland blasts one in the back of the net to give the admirals a 1-0 lead. Just 3 minutes later, Durron Myers tacks on another for a 2-0 lead with 30 minutes remaining.  The Cougars score off an impressive goal 30 yards out, but it wouldn’t be enough.

The Giants aren’t expected to make the playoffs in 2019 because they haven’t done much roster-building in the wake of consecutive down years.  During Saturday’s FanFest, CEO Larry Baer, appearing during a Q&A session under a tent beyond center field at Oracle Park, offered a six-word sentence that provided hope to Giants fans.  “One player can make a difference,” Baer said.  Baer was reflecting on Barry Bonds, whose arrival in 1993 helped turn a 90-loss team into a 103-win team, while answering a question on Bryce Harper.  The Giants have interest in the elite free-agent outfielder, who could be a difference-maker as Bonds was 26 years ago, and Baer wasn’t downplaying how Harper dramatically could boost the lineup and fill one of the outfield holes.  “The thing I’m very proud of with the Giants, and it’s not always successful - it was in ’92 with Barry - we want to be in the deal flow, so to speak. We want to be to bring championships back to the Giants’ fans,” Baer said.  “Bryce Harper is an amazing player. It’s very hard, and these are competitions, and I can’t handicap it. I don’t know where we are. But we’re giving it a shot. That’s all we can do.”  While praising Harper on various levels, including his workout regime, Baer noted with emphasis, “He’s 26 years old, too.”  Younger than Bonds when Bonds joined the Giants.  Baer, manager Bruce Bochy and president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi met with Harper in Las Vegas on Monday, and Baer was asked if the Giants’ brass tried to sell him on the Giants’ ballpark and fans.  “Overall, every time we go out, whether it’s talking to a player or draft pick,” Baer said, “the fact is, our fans are such a hugely persuasive argument to be a Giant. This is stuff he said publicly and others have, too, is they love coming to this ballpark with the electricity and the vibe.  “So that’s something we have going for us, but I don’t know. I’m not in his head, and I don’t want to make any forecast or predictions or anything. What I do know is we’ve got a lot of different plans, but it’s a very slow-moving offseason for a lot of reasons.  “All I can do is talk about the Giants, and our motivation is to get a bunch of guys on this team that will get us back to where we’ve been in recent years, and that’s winning rings.”  John Shea is The San Francisco Chronicle’s national baseball writer.

# Mamelodi Sundowns: Pitso urges Tade to earn his starting place

Despite having featuring among the PSL’s top goal-scorers so far this season, new Mamelodi Sundowns recruit, Emiliano Tade will have to earn a starting place at his new club, according to coach, Pitso Mosimane.  The Argentine striker left AmaZulu shortly before the close of the January transfer window, having done more than establish himself in the first half of his debut season in the league.  His exploits for Usuthu drew interest from some of the big guns, with the defending title-holders eventually winning the race for his services.  After two appearances for the Chloorkop-based outfit, the 30-year-old has already found the net, but Mosimane – who spoke to The Citizen – reveals that he will still have to earn a place in the starting line-up.   “Emi (Tade) must know that you don’t just walk in, you must earn it. We didn’t buy him for two games. We know that he found us where we are on the log and let’s be honest, we want him to help us to win the league. Not to deliver the league to us,” Mosimane told publication.  “You found people playing, let’s give respect to those who are there and I like it because it puts pressure on those who are there.” Tough task ahead for Emiliano Tade  Tade joins a club with already an embarrassment of riches, as far as attacking options are concerned, with the likes of Themba Zwane, Lebohang Maboe and Gaston Sirino enjoying first preference in the starting line-up.  Other forwards at the club’s disposal include Anthony Laffor, who has enjoyed more game time in recent weeks, while Jose Ali Meza, Jeremy Brockie and Phakamani Mahlambi have featured more sporadically throughout the current campaign.  Mosimane indicated that Tade could find it hard getting a run, even from the bench.   “Lebohang Maboe is performing. Gaston Sirino provides 70 to 80% of our goals. Themba Zane was good (against Black Leopards), Anthony Laffor was good. I need the captain (Hlompho Kekana) because who is going to pass those balls?” he said.  “I need Tiyani Mabunda to protect everybody at the back. Those are the six players in attack. If I take out Lebohang, we don’t score. If I take out Gaston we don’t get those assists.” Sundowns turn their attention to the Caf Champions League, where they will be taking on the Ivory Coast’s ASEC Mimosas before resuming their league title defence with a home fixture against Polokwane City.<end_of_turn>

# Rashford and Pogba combine to lead Man United to victory

LEICESTER, England (AP) — Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba combined to lead Manchester United to a 1-0 victory at Leicester on Sunday, with a seventh triumph in eight Premier League games under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer moving the team up to fifth place.  Rashford brought down a lofted pass from Pogba before striking into the bottom corner in the ninth minute of his 100th appearance for United.  Rashford and Pogba, who struggled under Jose Mourinho, now have 12 goals between them since Solskjaer replaced the fired Portuguese coach in December.  United moved two points behind Chelsea into fifth place, the record 20-time champion’s highest position since the opening weekend of the season.  Insight by GitLab: Learn how agencies are implementing applications to work across hybrid cloud environments in this exclusive executive briefing.  “Our attitude was spot on,” Solskjaer said. “There are a couple of bruised noses and knees. It is supposed to be like this, there are three points on the line. Our lads sacrificed everything they had.  “They know they can do better than this but a clean sheet is always a foundation to build on.”  Leicester remains 11th, having won only four home games in the league this season.  ___  More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports  Copyright © 2019 The Associated Press.

# How Mississippi State got better, even though they lost twice last week

Mississippi State's Ben Howland on Alabama. Tyler Horka, Clarion Ledger STARKVILLE – Mississippi State lost back-to-back games on its home floor last week. The Bulldogs have dropped out of both major polls and are back to two games under .500 in SEC play. But is it possible they got a little better in the process? Mississippi State (16-7, 4-6 SEC) is still in the top-30 of the NCAA’s NET rankings, which means the Dogs are still in line to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in a decade. That’s because those two losses were both good ones, if such a thing as a good loss exists. The first came to LSU, which sits at No. 17 in the NET rankings. The second came to Kentucky, which sits at No. 5. Both defeats came by four points. Head coach Ben Howland laments the loss to the former because the Bulldogs had a lead with less than five minutes left. Still, after blowing that advantage, Mississippi State managed to go to overtime against a team that has still only lost one conference game. Three days later, State took one of the best teams in the country to the wire. “The LSU game, we definitely feel like we should have had that one,” Howland said. “We played two of the best teams in the SEC,” freshman forward Reggie Perry added. “We try not to worry about our losses but still learn from them.” What Howland learned last week is that when it commits to playing as hard as it can on both ends of the floor, Mississippi State can play with the nation’s best teams. Against LSU, the Bulldogs went on a 17-0 run in the first half to swing the game in their favor. Then they let up a bit in the second half and eventually gave the game away. Against Kentucky, the script flipped. The Wildcats were clearly the more fluid, determined bunch in the first half. Then Mississippi State went on a 19-2 run that had everyone inside Humphrey Coliseum thinking a historic upset could be in the making. Even UK head coach John Calipari thought so. He said Mississippi State is a “top-20” team capable of advancing in the NCAA Tournament. He loves how tough the Bulldogs play. Important to note: Toughness has been the main knock on the Dogs in most of their losses this season. Calipari still saw a team capable of making noise in March. “Ben’s done a heck of a job with this group,” Calipari said, “and I’m glad we’re done with them. I hope we don’t have to see them in the (SEC) Tournament, to be honest.” Mississippi State must maintain last week’s level of play during the next two weeks to become the force Calipari sees them as. The Bulldogs don’t play a ranked team in their next five games. That starts Tuesday night against Alabama (15-8, 6-4 SEC) at 8 p.m. inside Humphrey Coliseum. The last time Mississippi State played Alabama, it fell victim to playing well in spurts and playing dreadfully in other stretches. The result was another four-point loss in Tuscaloosa. Howland said it all starts with defense. Those lopsided runs against LSU and Kentucky came because of transition offense that first started as steals or stout defense. Against Alabama late last month, Mississippi State couldn’t buy a bucket in part because it allowed such easy ones to the Crimson Tide. “There’s a big difference between taking it out of the net and taking it off the backboard,” Howland said. Mississippi State’s offense was greatly hindered by poor defense in the Alabama loss. For the most part, the Bulldogs have fixed the defense since then. Last week’s losses didn’t come because the Dogs weren’t defending; they came because the opponents were simply superior. State still nearly emerged victorious in both contests, though, which has Howland feeling confident that the next two weeks could be successful ones. “If we play with that kind of heart, intensity and all-out defense, we could be good against anybody in the country,” Howland said.<end_of_turn>

# Police: NYC man bit cop at P.C. Richard & Son store

A Queens man who police said attempted to use fake identification to buy thousands of dollars’ worth of merchandise at a P.C. Richard & Son shop in Levittown on Tuesday has been arrested and charged with numerous crimes, including biting a police officer.  Deshawn Webster, 24, went into the store at 2999 Hempstead Tpke. and tried to buy an Apple MacBook laptop computer, worth $2,249, with a forged New Jersey driver’s license, Nassau County police said in a news release.  “The employee then discovered the account had been involved with fraudulent activity earlier in the day with the same individual at a P.C. Richard’s in Greenvale,” according to the release.  Police were summoned. Webster tried to leave the store when a Nassau County police officer stopped him and questioned him, and a “struggle” ensued, police said.  Police said Webster ignored the officer’s instructions to stop resisting while the officer, with the store manager’s help, placed Webster under arrest.  “During the struggle, the officer suffered from a dislocated thumb, bite to his right hand, and significant pain to his right shoulder and knee,” according to the news release. “The manager of PC Richard’s also had substantial pain, suffering injuries to his left and right knees, rear of his neck, and lower back area.”  After Webster's arrest at 4:15 p.m., detectives said they found a “fraudulent” bank card on him.  Webster was arraigned on seven charges, including two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument and second-degree assault with intent to cause physical injury to a police officer.  He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Wednesday at First District Court in Hempstead, according to a spokeswoman for Nassau County district attorney's office. Bail was set at $2,500 cash or $5,000 bond.<end_of_turn>

# Scans 'pivotal' for NHS to work

Pencoed radiologist academy: Scans 'pivotal' for NHS to work  There are hopes a new NHS academy can be a "game changer" in training more radiologists to meet a shortfall in Wales. Technological advances mean more and more patients are being given scans to help in their diagnosis and treatment. But workforce numbers have been struggling to keep up. The National Imaging Academy Wales is being officially opened in Pencoed, Bridgend county, with the potential for more than doubling training places in Wales. Dr Sian Phillips, a consultant radiologist who oversees training in Wales, said it had proved challenging to meet demand.

# New pop-up baby and toddler store opens near Bristol

A new pop-up baby and child shop is opening in Yate to raise vital funds for Southmead Hospital's maternity ward.  Proud mums Emma Doney, and Claire Davis said their birthing experiences were so positive they wanted to do something to say thank you to the 'amazing midwives'.  After speaking to the hospital's charity, the duo discovered Southmead had plans to create a new space for women who were being induced. Somewhere the mums-to-be could sit and attempt to relax while they waited for active labour to begin.  Emma said: "Staff do everything they can to ensure the very best care for patients, however, currently many mums and dads to-be are sometimes cooped up on the ward for weeks on end with limited entertainment and distraction from their impending induction of their babies.  "This can be a stressful time and research has shown the more relaxed a mother is going into labour, the less likely she will endure a long or complicated labour.  "Many of our friends have recently endured endless nights of worry on the ward, away from their older children and husbands unable to focus on much at all.  "The maternity ward, gynaecology, Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and obstetrics as a combined unit which cannot be separated, was also considered too costly to include in the recent £430 million Southmead Hospital upgrades.  "It has therefore fallen to us to make a huge difference to these often-selfless mums to-be of Bristol and the surrounding area to make improvements to patient experience in the meantime.  The shop, which will sell clothes and toys for kids aged up to 10, will be based at Yate's Shopping Centre between March 4 to 29.  Can you help by making a donation? Here's a list of items the women are hunting for:    Children's clothes age 0-10 years     Nursing and maternity clothes    Feeding, sleeping & changing equipment    Toys, books and DVDs   Cots and prams Donations can be dropped at:  Mon 10:00-11:30, Ridgewood Community Centre, Yate BS37 4AF Tues 13:30-15:00, Hanham Methodist Church, BS15 8SD Weds 09:30-11:00, Cranleigh Court Children's Centre, Yate BS37 5DP -Thurs 13:30-15:00, Cadbury Heath Children's Centre, BS30 8AA<end_of_turn>

# Twin Falls man sentenced for insurance fraud

BOISE — A 44-year-old Twin Falls man was sentenced Monday for insurance fraud, Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden announced. Tony A. Herschler pleaded guilty in November. On Monday, Senior District Court Judge Thomas Ryan sentenced Herschler to serve three to six years in prison, but suspended the sentence, according to a statement from the AG’s office. Instead, Herschler will serve three years of probation and 180 days in jail, with 160 days as discretionary. He received credit for time served and is eligible to complete the remaining jail time with community service hours, the statement said. The court ordered Herschler to pay $880 in restitution to the Idaho Department of Insurance, $1,500 to Liberty Mutual, and court costs. An investigation revealed Herschler purchased a renter’s insurance policy with Liberty Mutual on Oct. 1, 2016. Eight days later, he filed a claim with the company and stated his room at the Super 7 Motel in Twin Falls had been burglarized and $33,360 in personal property was stolen, the statement said. He claimed the items stolen included a diamond ring, 10-ounce gold bar, a 1798 silver dollar, two 1917 George Washington dollar notes, a PlayStation 4 and 147 games, according to the statement. Liberty Mutual later discovered many of the video games reported stolen hadn’t yet been released to the public. Deputy Attorney General Jessica Cafferty in the Special Prosecutions Unit prosecuted the case. The Idaho Department of Insurance investigated.<end_of_turn>

# Led Zeppelin teams up with Vans sneakers for 50th anniversary

Led Zeppelin wants to take you over the hills and far away with new snowboard and sneaker creations honoring their 50th anniversary.  The classic rock group has teamed up with eternal hipster shoemaker Vans and the snow gear gurus at Burton on a Zeppelin-branded board and kicks.  Buyers of Burton’s $749.95 Zeppelin-branded Misty Mountain Hop snowboard also get a free copy of the group’s new book, “Led Zeppelin by Led Zeppelin,” with their order, although currently both sizes are out of stock.  There’s still no price tag or release date for the Zeppelin-inspired Vans, but a tweet from the band’s official account shows off the loot: Vans has imbued a whole lotta love into their Era- and Sk8-Hi-style shoes, redesigning both with art from the “Led Zeppelin IV” and “Hindenburg” albums, respectively.  Plus, the iconic LP covers got the T-shirt treatment and there’s also a baseball cap in the capsule collection.  So, when the levee breaks, make sure you’re ready to flee with your branded dad rock gear.  Ramble on!<end_of_turn>

# Is Mel B Still Married? Does She Have a Boyfriend?

Melanie Janine Brown, otherwise known as The Spice Girls’ Mel B, can currently be seen as a judge on America’s Got Talent: The Champions. The singer, whose last album released in 2005 and last single dropped in 2013, has found recent success on TV appearing on shows like The X Factor Australia, The Voice Kids: Australia, and Lip Sync Battle UK.  With the on-again, off-again Spice Girls reuniting for a 2019 tour, many have wondered if Scary Spice was still married. She is not.  In 1998, Mel B married her first husband, Dutch dancer Jimmy Gulzar. The couple had a daughter, Phoenix Chi Gulzar, in February of 1999. The very next year Brown filed for divorce which was finalized later that year. After winning custody of their daughter, Brown paid an alimony settlement of $2.8 million to Gulzar. Gulzar was later prosecuted for threatening Brown and attacking her sister. He was found guilty of the assault, but was later cleared of any wrongdoing.  After having a second child with actor Eddie Murphy, Mel B married film producer Stephen Belafonte in a secret ceremony in Las Vegas in 2007. This second marriage gave the Spice Girl her third child, Madison Brown Belafonte, but in 2017, the singer filed for divorce, accusing Belafonte of emotional and physical abuse. She cited her divorce from Belafonte and her father’s death as her reasons for seeking treatment for PTSD.  Mel is renowned for being open about her past relationships which have also included a four-year relationship with a woman. However, according to the singer, she is currently single and not actively looking to change her status.  In an interview with Gay Star News published last year, Brown said that she was single and “not open to any relationship right now.” She also revealed that she doesn’t feel the need to put a label on her sexuality, adding that “I’m not actively seeking it. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t, I’m very happy carrying on. My priorities are my kids, and myself. But if it happened – be it with a woman or whoever – I’m very open.” There’s no evidence to suggest otherwise, as Mel B continues to be focused on her family and her career, including the most recent season of America’s Got Talent now airing.  Mel B, whose book Brutally Honest came out last year, said she left out her former girlfriend on purpose. “I didn’t think it was fair to name her or to put that relationship out there. Now though, she’s actually laughing. ‘Why didn’t I get a chapter in the book like Eddie Murphy?!’ ‘Out of respect! I didn’t want to go there with you!’ If you care to, you can Google pictures of me and her online. But that wasn’t part of my storytelling for this book,” she said.  As for The Spice Girls, the group will tour Ireland and the UK in the late spring and summer sadly without the presence of Posh Spice Victoria Beckham. Current dates will take the tour to Coventry, Manchester, Edinburgh, London, and more.<end_of_turn>

# PTI faces resistance within party over Rashid's inclusion in PAC

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Raja Riaz on Tuesday said there is no need to make Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed a member of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).  “There are PTI members part of the PAC who are committed to working honestly. They will not allow Shehbaz Sharif to do anything against the rules,” Riaz said.  He added the committee is committed to working towards the betterment of the country.  On the other hand, the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) has decided to side with the government on calling for the resignation of Shehbaz as PAC chairman.  PAC and BAP member Senator Ahmed Khan said Shehbaz can be removed through voting. “We are supporters of the government and will stand with them,” he said.  The railways minister has strongly opposed Shehbaz’s appointment as PAC chairman and has termed it as a wrong decision. He has also filed a request in the Supreme Court against the appointment.  Earlier, Rashid set an eight-day deadline for Shehbaz to resign as chairman of PAC. “I have informed Prime Minister Imran Khan that Shehbaz Sharif is not acceptable to me as Public Accounts Committee chairman,” he had said.<end_of_turn>

# Blue Cross Plans Launch Food Delivery To Address Social Determinants

One of the nation’s largest Blue Cross Blue Shield companies is expanding food delivery to 40 zip codes considered "food deserts" in Chicago and Dallas through a new service as health insurers push further into addressing social determinants of health.  For now, the six-month pilot announced by Chicago-based Health Care Service Corp, which operates Blue Cross plans in five states, has begun meal deliveries in 25 Chicago zip codes with plans to expand the program to 15 zip codes in Dallas in April through a new venture known as foodQ.  “Through the foodQ service, the companies will offer consumers easy access to affordable, nutritious foods to improve their health outcomes, particularly for diet-related, chronic conditions, while reducing avoidable emergency room visits and hospital admissions,” Health Care Service said in announcing the new service with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Institute, which is a part of the national trade group and health plan lobby, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.    The idea behind such efforts whether they be paying for food delivery or paying rent and providing access to affordable housing is to improve health outcomes and help patients avoid getting sick and suffering a more serious illness or hospitalization in the future. Other insurers including Anthem, Cigna, Humana, UnitedHealth Group and CVS Health, which owns Aetna, are also pushing further into addressing social determinants of health.  “For us, it's really part of our effort to address root causes of an expensive healthcare system,” Health Care Service vice president and community health and economic impact officer Manika Turnbull said in an interview.  The Blue Cross plans’ foodQ is available to consumers who live in the targeted zip codes in the pilot. They don’t have to be Blue Cross health plan subscribers to participate, Health Care Service said.  Health Care Service is encouraging those interested to pay a $10 monthly service fee that will get consumers free delivery, details of the program say. If you subscribe, you can then get two meals for $10. If you don’t subscribe, you can still get the service but you have to pay $10 every time you order a meal plus a $6 delivery charge, according to the announcement.  With every state in the country having an “obesity prevalence” of 20% or more, Turnbull said the Blue Cross plans want to make sure they are making all efforts to provide access to fresh and healthy foods in so-called “food desserts” where affordable and nutritious meals are often elusive.  Health Care Service, which owns Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas and plans in Montana, Oklahoma and New Mexico, isn’t ruling out expanding the service to other markets. If the effort is successful during its six-month run, the goal is to scale it up and offer it to more consumers and potentially Blue Cross clients. Health Care Service is the nation's fourth-largest health insurer with more than 16 million subscribers.  “We know a ZIP code is just as important as a genetic code in determining a person’s health – impacting medical needs and access to care,” Blue Cross Blue Shield Institute president Dr. Trent Haywood said in a statement accompanying the launch of foodQ,“As a physician, I know I can easily write a prescription, but what I don’t know is how am I going to make sure patients have access to healthy meals they can afford and want to eat. With the alarming rates of obesity and diabetes in our country, we need a different approach to supporting healthy living, and this pilot program can help remove the barriers that keep people from accessing healthy, affordable and nutritious foods.” For more information on healthcare, read Bruce Japsen's book, Inside Obamacare: From Barack And Michelle To The Affordable Care Act.<end_of_turn>

# ‘The Boomerang’ Soundtrack Introduced Me To Love Before I Knew What It Was

Google tells me the soundtrack to the masterful, classic ‘90s film Boomerang was constructed in a mere two months. Meanwhile, despite me being only about a decade older than the soundtrack myself, and despite me having to sneak watch the film on VHS after my parents went to sleep as a kid, both works have stuck to my bones, giving me comfort and nostalgia I likely don’t deserve. Spun together by the unstoppable early '90s crew of Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, Daryl Simmons, and Antonio “L.A.” Reid, the Boomerang soundtrack has become a time capsule of sounds that seem ancient now: New Jack Swing, the husky contralto of Toni Braxton, the sentimentality of black boy-band R&B from the likes of Boyz II Men, and the otherworldly beauty of P.M. Dawn’s indelible sound. It also peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. The film and the soundtrack represented — along with soundtracks for other '90s films like the Tommy Davidson driven Strictly Business and the black-kid rite of passage soundtrack Waiting to Exhale— the introduction of a bourgeoise black urban middle class to a milieu of audiences. The film was an early whiff of things to come, perhaps not just for black romantic comedies, but for our lives. Boomerang dropped in 1992 and was helmed by Reginald Hudlin, a Harvard educated satirist and director whose work included House Party and who would go on to become president of BET. “In some ways it was a dream, it was ideal,” Hudlin says of working with the iconic comedian. “I was frustrated that he had never had a cast that supported him comedically in the way that he deserved." Boomerang gave Murphy just that. He was buttressed by some of the premiere comedic talent of the time. To his right was Martin Lawrence. To his left, David Alan Grier. Those heavy hitters were backed by Chris Rock and Tisha Campbell. And of course, Boomerang became a breakout moment for budding star, Halle Berry. The film was a box-office hit for Murphy. On a budget of $42 million, it cashed in at $132 million worldwide with over $70 million in domestic receipts. The soundtrack did even better. It entered the Billboard 200 chart at number eight, before reaching its pole position at number four. My own history is a byproduct of the socioeconomic tailwinds in which Boomerang was created. It was a decade after we found ourselves awash in a burgeoning artistic moment that aimed to disrupt blanket notions of race and class. All the while drug wars raged, the spectre of HIV decimated the black community, and corporate militarism ran amok. It was a magnanimous time, though fraught, and neo-black aesthetic essentialism was about to enter the mainstream. In the ‘70s and ‘80s the United States was experiencing an intense nursing shortage. Soon the nation reached down into its colonial holdings and offered a sweetheart deal to those who heeded and had luck: an H1-B visa and safe passage for your immediate family in exchange for labor. My mother took that deal, as many Caribbean mothers did, and I ended up on a plane to the United States from my native Jamaica. Four years later, I was a child in love with love ... How it could ground you in meaning in a life between two lives. Between my native Jamaica and my new home in New York. Between Caribbean patois and English. Between the harmonies of Boyz II Men and the rollicking swing of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis as well as Teddy Riley. The year was 1988, the hottest rapper alive was Slick Rick, and it was a snowy February in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York when I arrived as a smiley 5-year-old with no concept of how R&B would impact my young life. For me, rap was still a ways off. My parents predominantly played R&B in our two-bedroom apartment on Parkside Avenue, and it was there I fell in love with the genre. Four years later, I was a child in love with love. The idea of it. Its narrative. How feeling could leap into you. How it could ground you in meaning in a life between two lives. Between my native Jamaica and my new home in New York. Between Caribbean patois and English. Between the harmonies of Boyz II Men and the rollicking swing of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis as well as Teddy Riley. There was much in that between. There was the strained huskiness of K-Ci’s decries on desire, Luther Vandross’ roiling longing, Anita Baker’s elegant moans. All of these outrageously talented artists held together by the more traditional R&B of “L.A.” Reid at one pole and the creators of New Jack Swing at the other. Or so things seemed to me, my tiny slice of America’s love language pulling me further into its embrace. And that’s when I encountered Boomerang, and shortly thereafter its soundtrack. Especially P.M Dawn’s “I’d Die Without You.” P.M Dawn members Attrell Stephen Cordes, or “Prince Be,” and his brother Jarrett Cordes or “DJ Minutemix” made a kind of music that you could consider a precursor to today’s rhythmic polyglots like Dev Hynes, Childish Gambino and Frank Ocean. The band existed in a liminal space, three-fifths Massive Attack and one-fifths Isley brothers with one part Christian mysticism. Legendary critic Robert Christgau writing for the Village Voice called the group a “force for good in a world that generates too many misfits and not enough b-e-a-u-t-y.” In the film’s quietest moments, it was “I’d Die Without You” that elevated itself to a character. The song was a paean to love, but more importantly it was one to authenticity. To my 10-year-old mind, P.M Dawn was a revelation. Something so alien it made me feel I belonged to it. To a separate world out there where people got down to stuff like that. The song anchors crucial sections of the film, especially the end, where Murphy’s character Marcus whispers, “I can’t breathe without you” to Halle Berry's Angela. In truth, the characters were fighting for a sense of how to be young, gifted, and black in the world. Gen-X urban professionals of the time seemed to struggle with that idea. Now of two worlds, they had to choose blackness. As a child trying to figure out ways to match the adult world with my inner universe, the film felt like a fever dream of off-kilter artistic references that I couldn’t understand. That’s a sliver of what this soundtrack meant to me. I discovered Toni Braxton here when she shook my whole soul with “Love Shoulda Brought You Home,” as if I knew at the time what that really meant. Johnny Gill’s “There You Go” was the sweetest sounding foreplay construct I’d yet to hear. Grace Jones’ “7 Day Weekend” introduced me to the Jamaican-born supermodel and dance music superstar, and Boyz II Men’s “End of The Road” saw tears well up in my 10-year old eyes. More than anything, the soundtrack was overwhelmingly optimistic. It allowed me to dream past my wood-paneled childhood bedroom and into the future of my own family. To the woman I’d sing these songs to. And to the children we might have, who I’d introduce these artists to in much the same way my parents did, music filling our home with memories. Despite the times, a college-educated black urban class was living full lives, and I’d live mine too someday. One day. As a child trying to figure out ways to match the adult world with my inner universe, Boomerang felt like a fever dream of off-kilter artistic references that I couldn’t understand. Grace Jones’ artistic savant of a character Strange was both a wild caricature and a vision. Young Halle Berry fogged up my square metallic frames. Shoot, I wasn’t even allowed to watch the film as a kid. It was blacklisted along with Married With Children and all the Nightmare on Elm Street flicks. In Boomerang, an essential part of the idea of blackness was at stake. Could we climb the corporate ladder and keep our souls? If you just go by the soundtrack, the answer was a resounding yes. It wasn’t a love we couldn’t live without, it was ourselves who was the “you” we’d die without.<end_of_turn>

# ‘Bachelor’ Host Chris Harrison To Guest Star On ‘Single Parents’

Apparently, television personality Chris Harrison does not have enough work on his schedule. In addition to hosting the Bachelor and all of its associated series (including the Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise) for ABC and the daily syndicated game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, he is now going to shoot an episode of the comedy Single Parents.  Harrison won’t have to prep too hard for his guest-starring role though — he will be playing an exaggerated version of himself on the freshman hit series, which also airs on ABC.  According to Entertainment Tonight, he will be playing “a love guru, who, after several hundred years hosting the Bachelor, has a deep understanding of the human heart.”  The character will be sharing his expertise “in a magical encounter” with single moms Angie (Leighton Meester) and Poppy (Kimrie Lewis), who have lost their faith “in love and happy endings.”  The show’s Twitter page joked about Harrison’s role on Single Parents, writing, “When you’re single on [ABC], there’s one man we need to call.” A rose emoji was added at the end.  Harrison’s episode of the show will be filmed this week at the Bachelor mansion, and it is expected to air during the month of March.  Single Parents, which also stars Taran Killam and Brad Garrett, was one of the first new shows of the 2018 to 2019 television season to get a full-season order, which was given in the middle of October after just three episodes of the series had aired.  Meanwhile, the 47-year-old TV host recently found love for himself. The Inquisitr previously reported that Harrison finally went public with his girlfriend of several months, 31-year-old Entertainment Tonight correspondent Lauren Zima, on January 26 when they attended a pre-Screen Actors Guild Awards party hosted by Entertainment Weekly at West Hollywood’s Chateau Marmont.  Zima first hinted at their relationship on social media on December 6 when she posted a photo of herself and Harrison standing together with only a poster for Colton Underwood’s season of the Bachelor in between them.  “The two most important men in my life,” she wrote in the caption on Instagram.  The Dallas native had been single for a couple of years following the end of his 18-year marriage to his college sweetheart, Gwen, in May of 2012. They have two children together, 16-year-old son Joshua and 14-year-old daughter Taylor.  Single Parents airs Wednesday nights at 9:30 p.m., and the Bachelor airs Monday nights at 8 p.m. Both shows are on ABC.<end_of_turn>

# Meth 'disaster' for region as seizures surge in Thailand

BANGKOK: Seizures of high-purity crystal methamphetamine have surged more than tenfold in Thailand over the past two years, statistics show, a stark indicator of the growth in industrial-scale production of the stimulant in neighbouring Myanmar. Thailand is a major trafficking route for crystal meth manufactured in Myanmar's Shan and Kachin states, where police say Asian organised crime groups have allied with local pro-government militias and armed rebels to set-up "super labs". The drug syndicates have distributed the meth across the Asia-Pacific region, from South Korea to New Zealand and most countries in between, authorities say. Some 18.4 tonnes of crystal meth, also known as ice, was seized in Thailand in 2018, according to preliminary statistics from the country's Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) reviewed by Reuters. The final data is expected to be released publicly next month. That is up from 5.2 tonnes in 2017 and 1.6 tonnes in 2016. It is more than treble the amount captured across all of Southeast Asia five years ago. Myanmar's illicit labs also pump out tablets of meth mixed with caffeine, commonly know as "yaba", or crazy pill, in the Thai language. The tablets are popular with low-paid workers in gruelling jobs and poor recreational drug users across Southeast Asia. Thai authorities seized 516 million meth tablets in 2018, more than double the previous year and four-and-a-half times the 114 million pills captured in 2016.  Niyom Termsrisuk, secretary general of the ONCB, told Reuters that, despite the rising seizures, prices for meth are falling, suggesting far more is eluding authorities than being stopped. The average price of a meth tablet was 200 baht (US$6.33) in 2013. The latest data, for 2017, showed a yaba pill can be bought for as little as 80 baht (US$2.50), he said. By flooding Thailand and other countries with meth, organised crime groups have "generated new users" by enticing them with lower prices, Niyom said. The users then become dependent on the highly addictive drug, creating a bigger market for the product. "2018 A DISASTER" Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle - which encompasses northern Myanmar and parts of Laos and Thailand - has long been a hub of illicit drug trafficking. While opium cultivation and heroin refining has fallen in the past decade, methamphetamine production has more than filled the breach. "It's hard to say anything other than 2018 was a disaster for the meth supply coming out of Myanmar," said Jeremy Douglas, the Asia representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Law enforcement agencies were overwhelmed while "health authorities are seriously under-resourced and have limited capacity to offer treatment", he added. Regional police and analysts told Reuters that organised crime groups exploit the semi-lawless northern Myanmar borderlands, doing deals with the multitude of ethnic armed gangs and state-sponsored militias who control territory there. The ONCB's Niyom said 8 tonnes of crystal meth had been captured en route to southern Thailand and the border with Malaysia in 2018. From there, "it was on its way to other markets", he said. In the past year, police have intercepted boats laden with meth that left the Malaysian city of Penang. Syndicates also use "motherships" that pick up the drugs in the Andaman Sea and distribute them as far afield as Australia and New Zealand. Meth from Myanmar has also been found smuggled in shipping containers in the Philippines and Malaysia. According to regional anti-drugs police, who spoke on condition of anonymity, chemists are brought in from Taiwan and China to run the meth labs in Myanmar, while the precursors and lab equipment mostly come from China. Last month, Myanmar's military intercepted state-of-the-art laboratory equipment near Muse, a city in Shan state on the Chinese border. Regional police say the crystal meth produced in Myanmar is the purest they have seen. According to an ONCB briefing document reviewed by Reuters, 99.92 per cent of the crystal meth seized in Thailand in the first six months of 2018 was 90 per cent pure or higher.<end_of_turn>

# Attorney for Overland woman detained by ICE says law is on her client’s side

ST. LOUIS – The attorney for an Overland woman facing deportation after being in the US illegally for years is turning to the courts to try and keep the woman here.  Ilsa Guzman-Fajardo was arrested at the Robert A. Young Federal Building on Tuesday.  Her attorney, Evita Tolu, said the law is on the side of her client.  Guzman-Fajardo, a wife and mother of three, has been in the US illegally for 20 years; nearly all of that time in St. Louis.  Her family and friends said she’s never faced any problems until she was taken into custody at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office downtown.  Tolu was with Guzman-Fajardo when she was arrested. She was back at the same office Wednesday to deliver an emergency motion meant to stop Guzman-Fajardo’s pending deportation back to her native country of Honduras.  The motion specifically argues that when Guzman-Fajardo first crossed into the US in 1999 and asked for asylum, she was given incomplete paperwork by authorities for her court hearing. Tolu claimed the paperwork did not list a specific date, place, and time for the hearing.  Tolu said that violated Guzman-Fajardo’s due process rights and since she did not know where to go for her hearing, the deportation order should be invalid.  The order was issued in January 2000 after Guzman-Fajardo did not show up for court.  Tolu also filed the motion with the San Diego immigration court where Guzman-Fajardo’s case was heard.  According to Tolu, Guzman-Fajardo has been a model citizen in the US and has regularly checked in with authorities since she learned about the deportation order in 2014.  Tolu said Guzman-Fajardo was in the Montgomery County Jail Tuesday evening but will be transferred to the Pulaski County Detention Center in southern Illinois. Tolu said Guzman-Fajardo's family was accepting donations online to help cover the cost of her legal fees.  A spokesperson for ICE said authorities were simply executing the judge’s deportation order. It’s unclear when Guzman-Fajardo may be deported.<end_of_turn>

# As playoff game looms, Parkview girls focused on the task, not the select/nonselect system

Two years ago, Parkview Baptist won the Division II select girls basketball title and the year before that the Eagles were the Class 3A runner-up. As her team prepares for its Division II bidistrict round playoff game, Parkview coach Christina Lockett Anderson sees both sides of the LHSAA’s playoff dilemma. The 14th-seeded Eagles (6-14) host No. 19 E.D. White Catholic (5-23) at 6 p.m. Thursday for a game that matches two teams with losing records. Playoff games that feature teams with losing records have been a recurring theme since LHSAA principals voted to expand the select/nonselect playoff split past football to include basketball, baseball and softball. “I am willing to have the conversation about the playoffs and possible changes with anyone,” Anderson said. “I would like to see all schools play in seven classes like we used to. This is the system we have. We are preparing for a playoff game and our goal is to advance.” The playoff teams/losing records debate started in 2013, the first year of the football split when winless, one-win and two-win teams made the playoffs. Expanding the split in 2016-17 took the debate to another level. The 2019 select girls basketball brackets fuel the discourse. Under the traditional system in which select/nonselect teams played together, teams with winless and losing records were typically filtered out of the playoffs. Those teams fill out bracket spots in multiple sports. Division II is made up and 4A and 3A select teams. The EDW-Parkview game is one four bidistrict match-ups that feature two teams with losing records. Three others have one team with a losing record. Anderson, who also serves as principal at PBS and played at Bethany Christian, provides a rationale for her team. “In the old system, you had to earn your way into the playoffs,” Anderson said. “Now you win to prove you belong. The thing I’ll always remember about this group is their personality. We've learned so much about each other. We've learned to laugh and we've fought.” The debate involves more than Division II. For example, in Division I/Class 5A, five of the eight schools have losing records, including 0-19 Evangel Christian, which plays top-seeded John Curtis. There are six Division V/Class B-C teams and just two of those teams have winning records. Family Christian (19-11) is one of the two teams with a winning record. Thursday night will be game, not debate time for PBS. Sophomore Aaliyah Cyprian leads Parkview with a 20.0 scoring average. Jalyn Wright contributes 14.0. Win or lose, Thursday’s game will serve as a bridge to next season. “I can't speak for other teams. These are not just girls wearing uniforms – they’re competitors,” Anderson said. Second season, new gym Second-seeded Walker (29-4) of Class 5A is set to play its first game in the school’s new Thursday night. The Lady Cats host No. 31 Destrehan (17-16) at 6 p.m. The new gym is part of a large construction project at the school. It was turned over to school officials by the contractor late last week. The Walker boys team hosted games with Denham Springs last Friday and Live Oak on Tuesday. “The girls got to watch the boys game the other night and saw what it is like. We’ve practiced in there,” Walker acting coach Hannah Jones said. “I think they are excited about it. But it is a lot different. There is more space and you shooting perception is different.”<end_of_turn>

# Elections: Buhari reveals what Bill Clinton told him - Daily Post Nigeria

Home » News » Elections: Buhari reveals what Bill Clinton told him News Elections: Buhari reveals what Bill Clinton told him Published on February 14, 2019 By Fikayo Olowolagba President Muhammadu Buhari has revealed his discussion with former President of the United States, Bill Clinton, ahead of Saturday’s presidential election. Former US President, Clinton, had canceled his trip to Nigeria ahead of Saturday’s general elections, saying the visit could be “politicized”. Buhari, in a statement issued by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, released on Thursday, appreciated Clinton for his continuous support for Nigeria and the growth of her democracy despite missing the final signing of the peace accord. The President, who took a telephone call from President Clinton Wednesday night, said the ex-president regretted not visiting Nigeria. He said Clinton, in the telephone call on Wednesday night, wished Nigeria a free and fair poll on Saturday. Buhari further commended his constant support for the peace, stability, and progress of Nigeria under a democratic dispensation, describing the ex-US president as a friend of the country. The statement read in part: “President Buhari assured Clinton of his commitment to free, fair and credible elections in the weeks ahead. “President Clinton, who regretted his inability to visit the country to witness the signing of the final peace accord before the general elections, wished Nigeria well as her citizens go to the polls.” NIGERIA DECIDES: Read 2019 Presidential Election Analysis Subscribe to Daily Post.

# United says Mourinho firing cost $25M, revived by Solskjaer

United says Mourinho firing cost $25M, revived by Solskjaer  LONDON (AP) - The firing of Jose Mourinho cost Manchester United 19.6 million pounds ($25 million) in payoffs. The club already sees it as money well spent.  The compensation for dismissing Mourinho and six members of his coaching staff was disclosed among "exceptional items" in the latest set of financial results published Thursday by United that showed record revenue.  Highlighting the difficulty replacing Alex Ferguson, United has now spent 33.2 million pounds dismissing the three managers hired since he retired in 2013 after 26 trophy-laden years in charge.  When Mourinho was fired in December, United was sixth in the Premier League. Former striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was brought back to Old Trafford as temporary manager and he has lifted the team back into fourth - a Champions League qualification spot.  The appointment of Solskjaer and assistant manager Mike Phelan, who worked under Alex Ferguson at United, "has had a positive impact throughout the club," vice chairman Ed Woodward said.  "We are delighted with the improvement in the team's performances since December and we look forward to a strong finish to the (20)18-19 season."

(AP Photo/Dmitry Golubovich)  Solskjaer only has a contract until the end of the season and is on a loan agreement with Norwegian club Molde but hopes to stay. Woodward told investors on a conference call that Solskjaer "revived" the team by opening his reign with a club-record eight successive wins and won the Premier League's manager of the month award.  Solskjaer is the first United manager to collect the accolade since Ferguson retired after winning 13 Premier League titles and the Champions League twice.  David Moyes lasted 10 months as Ferguson's immediate successor before being fired along with his coaches at a cost of 5.2 million pounds in 2014.  Despite Louis van Gaal winning the first major trophy of the post-Ferguson era - the 2016 FA Cup - he was fired after two years primarily for failing to qualify for the lucrative Champions League. The payoffs to Van Gaal and his coaches reached 8.4 million pounds.  Mourinho, who replaced Van Gaal, had a contract through next season, but the risk of missing out on the top four led to his dismissal.  United can more than cover the compensation costs given the strength of its commercial operation.  For the second quarter of the financial year - the three months to Dec. 31 - United reported revenue rising 18 percent to a record 208.6 million pounds. The club is forecasting annual revenue to be between 615 million and 630 million pounds.  "Our continued financial strength underpins our long-term success on the field, which is the focus of everyone at the club," Woodward said.  ___  More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports  Manchester United caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer leaves the field after defeat in the Champions League round of 16 soccer match between Manchester United and Paris Saint Germain at Old Trafford stadium in Manchester, England, Tuesday, Feb. 12, 2019.

# Colorado Democrats bring “red flag” gun bill back to statehouse

A bill that would let law enforcement agencies across Colorado remove firearms from people a judge deems a high risk for harming themselves or others was reintroduced at the statehouse Thursday.  It’s called a “red flag” or extreme risk protection order bill, and House Majority Leader Alec Garnett, D-Denver, is again sponsoring it in memory of Douglas County sheriff’s deputy Zackari Parrish, who was killed at a Highlands Ranch apartment complex in 2017 while he tried to negotiate with a man in the midst of a mental health crisis.  “What we are doing with this bill is giving law enforcement a tool that they need to save lives,” said Rep. Tom Sullivan, D-Centennial, the bill’s other main sponsor. “It gets the people who are having these difficult times the help that they need and protects their families and the community from them having a problem.”  The way an extreme risk protection order would work under this bill is that law enforcement, family member or a household member could petition a judge for the removal of a person’s firearms. The judge would hold a hearing — without the gun owner being present — to decide whether to grant a temporary order for up to 14 days.  During those two weeks, the gun owner and the person who asked for the order would tell the judge why those weapons should or shouldn’t be returned. The judge could extend the order for up to 364 days.  That’s about double the length of time in the 2018 bill. Garnett said people in law enforcement asked for the longer time frame. The biggest changes to the bill, however, came from discussions with the criminal defense bar.  The bill would provide the gun owner with a lawyer free of charge if he or she wanted one. It would also give judges the discretion to hold additional hearings and potentially lift the order early. The previous iteration of this bill only gave judges one opportunity for review beyond the first hearing.  “We provided the judges opportunities for mental health and drug and alcohol evaluations,” Garnett said. “It’s kind of an intervention point where the judge can help people get treatment.”  Those changes haven’t prompted any Republicans to co-sponsor the bill, but Sullivan and Garnett both think there’s potential to bring some of their counterparts on board. Two Republican House members voted for the 2018 version. That bill never got a vote in the full Senate, though, as a Republican-controlled committee voted it down. Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, a gun rights group, characterized the 2018 bill as the “Gun Confiscation Act” and actively campaigned against any Republican who supported it.  House Minority Leader Patrick Neville, R-Castle Rock, said he opposed the previous bill because of a concern that it would make people — especially veterans — more reluctant to seek mental health treatment.  Colorado lawmakers haven’t passed a major piece of gun legislation since 2013 — the last time Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. Democrats passed universal background checks, required people to pay for those checks and banned high-capacity magazines. Voters recalled two Democratic senators for their support of those bills.  “We’re confident,” said Sullivan, who lost his son, Alex, in the Aurora theater shooting. “We have a story to tell, and this is what the story is: We’re here to save lives.”  The bill was introduced on the first anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. That gunman, like the one who killed Parrish, was known by local law enforcement as a troubled person.  Florida passed an extreme risk protection order law in the wake of that shooting, and the state’s Republican governor signed it. Sullivan said he firmly believes a bill like this could have saved Parrish’s life here in Colorado.  “There’s no doubt in my mind,” Sullivan said. “So now we’re on the clock again to save more lives.”<end_of_turn>

# Former state resident returns to run Gladwin library system

Former state resident returns to run Gladwin library system  John Clexton's love of reading and books had him working as a school library aide from the time he was in second grade. Later, he worked many years as a library manager, and most recently as a library director in St. Croix, Virgin Islands.  He recently jumped at the opportunity to come back to Michigan, where he just finished his first week as the Gladwin County District Library director. The county has public libraries in Beaverton and Gladwin.  "I've always had a passion for libraries and always wanted to be a library director," said Clexton, who earned his master's in library science at Wayne State University.  Clexton, 47, is the second full-time Gladwin County District Library director. He fills the shoes left vacant by the beloved former director Bruce Guy, who died last January. Guy became the first director in 2005.  Library board member Bob Frei, also a longtime friend of Guy, said the board voted unanimously last month to hire Clexton. He said the board and the library staff were impressed with him and felt he had all the qualifications they sought. Frei said they wanted someone to keep the library relevant and to grow, and the board believes they found that in Clexton.  "We expect under John's leadership that the growth and diversification of the library and its services will continue," Frei said. "The function of libraries has expanded over the years. What started out as a book lending organization in 1934 has grown into a research facility, family and community history resource center, internet on-ramp, source for paper, audio and electronic books and periodicals, meeting venue, and business resource center.  "It now features children's libraries at both locations, as well as comfortable reading areas, historical and community displays and many other amenities," Frei added. "It also hosts many events and programs throughout the year for people of all ages. John recognizes that libraries are changing, and he embraces the changes that are necessary (for) libraries to meet the modern information needs of its patrons."  Clexton said stepping into Guy's shoes makes the job more challenging.  "I'm honored to fill those shoes and add on and continue to some of what (Guy) has done," Clexton said, citing the work Guy started in incorporating science, technology, engineering and math activities, robotics and coding.  "Libraries hold traditional values but are changing as well," said the father of three.  Clexton, who said he normally is reading about eight books (biographies, history, non-fiction) a month and tries to finish at least one in that time, said his new responsibilities might limit the number of books he has going at one time. As director, he is involved in everything from circulation to maintenance.  Clexton is also thrilled to have such a capable library staff, such as longtime employee Laura Walters, who has acted as interim director for the past year.  "She is a gem," Clexton said of Walters. "She is so knowledgeable and an asset to this library. She will continue all the great things she does."  Clexton has held two meet and greets with the community, and said he is overwhelmed by the hospitality.  "I'm looking forward to having fun in the area," Clexton said.<end_of_turn>

# FTC says romance scams cost Americans $143 million last year

By Taylor Twelford | Washington Post  Love is a scam. No, really: romance scams have skyrocketed in the past few years and are now the most common kind of consumer fraud — and the most costly, according to a report released this week by the Federal Trade Commission.  These predatory schemes often unfold online, on dating sites and social media alike, with the fraudster going to great lengths to connect with someone to extract money from them. Scammers will make fake profiles, concoct elaborate backstories or even impersonate real people to appear more convincing. Then they’ll try to cash in on their connection, using tall tales about medical emergencies or personal misfortune. But the damage extends far beyond financial loss.  “I am a smart woman with decades of successful working experience. I have made mistakes in my life but nothing like this,” wrote a 63-year-old victim of a romance scam who shared her story with AARP. “The ripple effects have been so devastating and I have to deal with them almost every day of my life.”  The FTC received 21,368 reports of romance scams in 2018, up from about 13,000 reports the previous year. Losses from romance scams have increased fourfold since 2015, and the really unlucky in love were swindled out of $143 million in 2018, according to the report.  Older people are more likely to be targeted in romance scams and also report greater financial losses. Victims between the ages of 40 and 69 lose money at double the rate of younger ones. Elderly victims are generally the most vulnerable — individual median losses for people over 70 were $10,000. The median individual loss across all ages was $2,600.  Some scams stretch over months or even years, making the betrayals emotionally devastating as well as financially. Even after the hoaxes are exposed, victims must grapple with the loss of a relationship they thought was real, and the shame of having been manipulated. TheLos Angeles woman who told her story on the California AARP’s website, named only as Jane Doe to protect her identity, said she was scammed out of over $1 million and was nearly driven to suicide as result.  A few years after her husband died of cancer, the woman said, she joined e-Harmony and after a few months met a man online who claimed to be a successful engineer in Beverly Hills. In lengthy emails, the man unfurled his tragic history. He claimed to also have lost his spouse to cancer and faked an email from his “daughter” who he said was studying at Cambridge University and was grateful her father had found real love.  Weeks later, he made his first ploy for cash, claiming his bank account had been frozen and asking her for $7,500 to purchase equipment for his last big engineering job before retirement, the woman said. She loaned him the money, which kicked off an avalanche of requests for more funds and excuses about why they couldn’t meet in person, like illnesses and business trips that kept getting extended. When she was laid off, he promised he’d take care of her. “Every day he would send notes professing his love for me and I would be waiting anxiously for his calls and emails. I was totally brainwashed,” the woman wrote. “I was losing weight, not eating or sleeping because he would call at all hours of the day and night.”  In less than three months of correspondence, she gave the scammer $1 million and drained her retirement savings. By the time she realized what was going on and reported her losses to the police, she understood that she’d likely never get her money back. Crippled by shame, she considered ending her life. Now she works part-time, making $11.75 an hour, and lives with a roommate.  “My dreams of retiring and traveling have been smashed,” the woman wrote. “I am not the person I was.”  “The Internet makes this type of crime easy because you can pretend to be anybody you want to be. You can be anywhere in the world and victimize people,” Christine Beining, a fraud investigator with the FBI said in a 2017 warning about romance scams.  Although the thrill and fervor of a romantic entanglement can blind victims to warning signs, common red flags may be able to save people from heartbreak.  The FBI notes that many scammers quickly try to migrate conversations from dating sites or social media to go “offline.” They often try to isolate their victims, gaining personal information they can use to extort them.  To guard against scams, the FBI recommends taking it slow with online romances and asking lots of questions. Search the person’s biographical information on social media or other dating platforms to see if it’s been recycled. Above all else, the FBI maintains that no one should lend money to someone they haven’t met in real life.  If someone is concerned about a possible scam, the FBI recommends ceasing contact and reporting the issue to its Internet Crime Complaint Center.<end_of_turn>

# DMK,Congress tie up an alliance of corruption: Amit Shah

[India], Feb 14 (ANI): BJP President Amit Shah on Thursday hit out at the Congress-DMK tie up alleging that the same is an alliance of corruption. "DMK and Congress is an alliance of parties that follow the dynastic politics. It is an alliance of corruption. They have come together to create wealth for their families," said Shah while addressing a gathering here. He claimed that Prime Narendra Modi will again become the Prime Minister this year. "Entire nation has decided that in May 2019, once again a government will be formed under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi," he added. Lauding the central government for its schemes that have benefited the people of the state, Shah said: "Under Ujjawala Yojana, 29 lakh free gas connections have been given in Tamil Nadu. Moreover, we gave AIIMS to Madurai, Rs. 1,213 crore for the development of the Textile industry, Rs, 20,000 crore for Railways, Rs. 3,600 crore under PMAY, Rs. 828 crore for smart cities." Furthermore, Shah claimed that the constitutional approval for OBC which had been pending for around 50 years was approved under Modi's regime. "In Tamil Nadu, people belonging to OBC community are in large number. The constitutional approval for OBC was pending for the last 50 years, but it is the Modi government that gave the constitutional status to them," he asserted. The Lok Sabha in August 2018 unanimously passed the Constitution 123rd Amendment Bill, 2017 which granted constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC). All the members present in the lower house unanimously voted in favour of the Bill with over two-third majority. (ANI)<end_of_turn>

# Missouri AG expands ‘Safer Streets Initiative’ to KC to focus on repeat offenders

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- There have already been 16 homicides in Kansas City since the beginning of the year. On Thursday, state leaders announced a new initiative to stop the trend called "Safer Streets Initiative."  Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced plans to expand the program from St. Louis to Kansas City.  The initiative plans to cut down on crime by focusing on repeat offenders. Research from the Department of Justice showed a majority of violent crimes came from 5 percent of the city's population.  After a violent start to 2019, Schmitt said he hopes the Safer Streets Initiative will provide new hope for families.  "Mothers are sitting at home waiting and worrying that their loved ones may never return. Grandfathers are having their cars violently stolen in the very same neighborhoods where they live. People should not worry about heading to Westport or spending your evening with family and friends in Power & Light," he said.  Kansas City saw a spike in crime in 2017 when the Missouri State Highway Patrol reported more than 160 violent crimes in Jackson County alone.  The Project Safe Neighborhoods program will also help prosecutors to more fully prosecute violent crimes and find justice for those families.<end_of_turn>

# Vatican defrocks former US cardinal McCarrick over sex abuse

The Vatican says Pope Francis has defrocked former U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick after Vatican officials found him guilty of soliciting for sex while hearing Confession.  The punishment announced on Saturday for the once-powerful prelate and Archbishop of Washington comes a few days before Pope Francis is to lead an extraordinary gathering of bishops from around the world over the sex abuse crisis which has eroded the faith of many Catholics and threatened his papacy.  Defrocking means McCarrick, 88, who now lives in a friary in Kansas after he lost his title of cardinal last year, won't be allowed to celebrate Mass or other sacraments.

# 'It was just a disaster': Ill-timed snow clearing has parents fearing for kids' safety | CBC News

'It was just a disaster': Ill-timed snow clearing has parents fearing for kids' safety City admits it broke its own rules in twice plowing during morning drop-off period Staff and parents at Laura Secord School in Wolseley are disappointed in the city's snow clearing efforts this year. After waiting days for the roads and sidewalks in their residential area to be cleared, the fix that finally came wasn't what they were hoping for. Late last week, parents dropping kids off at the school were met by six or seven front-end loaders. That's according to the Wolseley Residents' Association. "They had this massive snow clearing effort on a school day during school loading times," said Chris Beauvilain, a parent of a Laura Secord pupil. "It was terrifying to see students and parents scrambling around front-end loaders. They're huge, massive pieces of machinery. The kids are halfway up the wheels." Beauvilain said the snow clearing equipment was blocking the parking zones and the accessible drop-off area in front of the school. He says one of the vehicles knocked over a school zone sign. "The plows weren't stopping at stop signs or the crosswalks. It was just a disaster." School administration contacted the city and Cindy Gilroy, the councillor for Daniel McIntyre. Gilroy's office responded — informing the school that measures were taken to ensure that this would not occur again. But on Thursday morning, parents were met with another fleet of snow-clearing vehicles. "This is a winter city. We've got councillors saying we're the best snow clearing city in the world and it's a little discouraging and disappointing to see this happening, not just once but recurring," said Beauvilain. "It's amazing to me that in the entire city they chose to plow the school at that time." Gilroy said she's not giving up on the issue and is encouraging parents to make official complaints to her office and to the city. "We have to make it clear that snow clearing is not to take place in schools zones at school times," she said. I understand the concerns, I have three young kids myself.- Michael Cantor, manager of streets maintenance According to the city's own guidelines, Gilroy is right. Street maintenance crews have to follow a plowing manual which states that no snow clearing can be done in school zones during peak drop-off and pick-up hours in the morning or the afternoon. Michael Cantor, the manager of streets maintenance for the City of Winnipeg, said this was a mistake on the part of the city crews assigned to Wolseley. "I understand the concerns, I have three young kids myself," said Cantor. "This was really an unfortunate incident; and it's not the first time." This is Cantor's first winter in his position. He said he's learned a lot and this incident in particular has inspired change. Starting immediately, Cantor said the city will be implementing a few fixes. First, a memo will be issued to all relevant employees reiterating the rules for plowing school zones. Cantor's department is also in the process of drawing up new zone maps to ensure those rules are made visually clear to the crews. "There are a lot of moving pieces since we do contract out some of those zones." According to Cantor, the city hires 10 separate companies to perform snow clearing — each responsible for one zone — covering about 70 per cent of the city. The other 30 per cent is cleared by city crews. Wolseley is one of the zones covered by city employees. Starting next year, Cantor said all his employees will be required to attend winter training before the season begins. "I think these steps will ensure that our employees are aware of this, how important it is, and remind them to have consideration for school zones."<end_of_turn>

# New direct flight to connect Israel to Kerala

New direct flight to connect Israel to Kerala "A new direct flight will be launched this September from Tel Aviv to Kochi by Arkia Israeli Airlines", said Kerala tourism minister ``A new direct flight will be launched this September from Tel Aviv to Kochi by Arkia Israeli Airlines, which will be a major boost to tourism in India in general and Kerala in particular,” said Kerala tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran. There is a direct flight from Tel Aviv, the second most populous city in Israel, to Delhi and Mumbai. For the first time in its history, Kerala tourism department participated in the International Mediterranean Tourism Market (IMTM) in Tel Aviv, foraying into the largely untapped Israeli market in a bid to substantially increase footfalls from the Middle East country.. Tourism director P Bala Kiran led the state delegation at the two-day IMTM 2019, the largest annual professional tourism fair of its kind in the eastern Mediterranean, which concluded yesterday. On the occasion, Kerala Tourism launched a coffee table book which featured the odyssey of the jews who decided to make Kerala their home before several of the diasporic community going back to Israel, their fatherland. ``In the highly competitive global marketplace, we need to scout for new source markets abroad to attract tourists. Our participation in a prestigious event like IMTM will act as a trigger to meet that objective,” Surendran said. Tourism secretary Rani George said Kerala’s participation in IMTM was part of an aggressive campaign of its tourism department to woo visitors from non-traditional markets. “We have already made strong presence in the Gulf countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Forging strong ties with Israel’s tourism segment will open new vistas of expansion for Kerala tourism in that region,” she noted. Kerala was visited by 15,339 Israeli tourists in 2018, a huge increase of 29% as compared to 11,892 in 2017.<end_of_turn>

# Health‚ education our priorities‚ says Eastern Cape premier in Sopa

The Eastern Cape government is ready to roll out the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme to the rest of the province‚ premier Phumulo Masualle said during his state of the province address in Bhisho on Friday.  Masualle said they would focus on building on infrastructure progress made in the NHI to revitalise provincial and regional hospitals.  The project had been piloted in the Alfred Nzo and OR Tambo districts.  Masualle‚ whose speech largely focused on his past five years as head of the government‚ said the pilot project had yielded valuable results.  "We are now ready to mainstream to the rest of the province. This includes the introduction of doctors to the primary health-care facilities through general practitioner contracting‚ as well as the provision of pharmacist assistants to improve the availability of medicine (at clinics)."  Speaking on the economy‚ Masualle said strides had been made to improve the lives of people in the province and this could be attributed to the commitment of major investors.  "Despite perennial challenges of a constrained global and domestic economy‚ coupled with a tight fiscal environment and a long drought‚ the Eastern Cape government has made a positive contribution towards the betterment of the lives of people in the province‚" he said.  Masualle said the address was aimed at laying a solid foundation for the sixth administration that would take over after the May 8 elections.  Masualle highlighted education‚ health‚ agriculture and infrastructure achievements during his term at the helm.  "At the start of the term we set out to transform the Eastern Cape economy. Indeed‚ a great deal of work has been done and much ground has been covered‚ both by this fifth administration and other administration.  "Without any hesitation‚ access to education continues to improve‚ more have access to basic services like electrification‚ water and sanitation‚ and broadened access to health care‚ resulting in improved life expectancy. The quality of life for more of our inhabitants continues to improve‚" Masualle said.  He added that disciplinary action had been taken against officials who had contributed to the decision by the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) to downgrade Mthatha airport from category 4 to category 3.  He said they were in the process of instituting consequence management against those responsible.  "I can report here that an announcement regarding the restoration of Mthatha airport to CAT 4 can be expected soon‚" Masualle said.  - TMG Digital<end_of_turn>

# Former Jumia Travel boss Marek Zmyslowski writes on why he was declared wanted by Interpol

Serial investor and entrepreneur Marek Zmysłowski has narrated how he was placed on Interpol's 'Most Wanted' list, which was as a result of his business ambitions in Nigeria.  On Thursday, February 14, 2019, Zmysłowski, who co-founded Jovago and HotelOga, published a post on his Medium in which he claims he was arrested by the Polish Border Security because he was declared wanted by "the Nigerian Government for the crimes of Advanced Financial Fraud."  Further, into his story, he notes when his problem began in Nigeria. "After leaving Jumia in 2015, I launched “HotelOga”. The company was funded from my private capital and investment from minority shareholders from Nigeria, India, and Poland. The local investor was a very prominent businessman with his hands in many different sectors, strategic for the Nigerian economy. He had also powerful friends that allowed him to keep those hands there. Someone you want to have as a “Godfather” in a hostile business environment. Where you definitely don’t want to be, is when the “Godfather”, your support system, turns against you."  According to Medium Post, he and his local investor disagreed on company vision and managerial style started to affect the business.  "During the startup fight for growth and survival, a conflict (around the company vision and management style) between myself and the Godfather arose. It reached a threshold when he, together with our CFO, tried to kick me out of the management board and take control of the company.  They failed because my team, my co-founder and other shareholders came to my defense. The conflict, however, paralyzed our operations for months and almost made us go bankrupt. We were able to save the company by merging with our biggest competitor from East Africa.  "This allowed me to exit the company and remove myself from the equation, hoping that this move will release the tension between stakeholders."  Zmysłowski further narrates that he was arrested at Warsaw airport when his name showed up on Interpol's 'wanted list'.  "The justification of the arrest only included a very vague description of my alleged crimes. Apparently, I stole my investor and my CFO money. The only evidence in the case? Victim statement. Nothing else. Just “testimonies”.  "Imagine going to the police now and telling them that your neighbor stole a million dollars from you. And now the police goes to arrest your neighbor without even asking if you ever had a million, not even bothering to ask if you have any proof of the theft" he writes.  Marek Zmysłowski was released the next day after the Nigerian Police failed to send supporting documentation to back up its claim.  He also writes that the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign affairs has also failed to send "a formal request to explain the situation and give any information about the actions against" him for the past six months.  In his post, he alleges that the Interpol was complicit in the affair.  "The day I left the Polish custody. I got 3 phone calls. The first one was from my Nigerian banker who informed me about the police order to freeze all my accounts. The second call came from a Nigerian journalist, that got a tip from “someone” about my arrest and wanted my comments. Someone really wanted to give me some bad press.  The only people in Nigeria that knew at that time about my detention in Poland, were the Police officers behind the arrest warrant. The third person I spoke to that day, was the “Godfather’s” lawyer. Her offer was pretty simple. If I pay 300k USD, my problems with the Nigerian justice system and Interpol will go away. And my image in the media will remain untarnished. That’s how some people secure their investment returns" writes Zmyslowski in his Medium post.  He says he went ahead to sue the Nigerian Police Force. "On July 23rd, 2018, the judge ruled in my favor. My arrest warrant was struck down, bank freeze was ruled as illegal and I was even given a 2 mln Naira compensation. The symbolic amount in a symbolic victory.  "Does it mean my problems are over? Not at all. Winning a case in Nigeria is one thing. Having anyone respect that court ruling is another. The same people in Nigeria that put me on the system are the only ones who can take me down. And of course, they haven’t. The only way left was to apply directly to the Interpol Headquarters in Lyon, France."  You can read Marek Zmysłowski's entire account of his recent travails on his Medium post.<end_of_turn>

# Nathan Lyon channel’s Glen McGrath in incredible Ashes prediction ahead of busy calendar

EXPLAINER: Cummins, Healy win big at Australian cricket awards1:10 Pat Cummins has confirmed his status as Australia's premier Test paceman after edging out Nathan Lyon to win the Allan Border Medal, while Alyssa Healy won the prestigious Belinda Clark Award. (AAP Video) Australian fans can rejoice — the Ashes are coming home. That is if Nathan Lyon has his way. The Aussies have had a torrid time in England since 2001, the last time Australia had won an Ashes series in the heart of the old enemy. Australia have been dominant at home with just one series loss in 32 years but after four straight unsuccessful tours, Lyon thinks England have had enough success. And he thinks Australia will do it in style. The 31-year-old Lyon, who has led out the Australian team song since Mike Hussey handed it on following his retirement in January 2013, thinks he’ll be very acquainted with the words of the song on the road. Channelling Glen McGrath, who always predicted big wins for Australia, Lyon said Australia will win the Ashes “5-0”. Despite tipping a lopsided victory for the Aussies, Lyon said he’s wary of a wounded England. Legends have piled on England after a horror series in the West Indies. England lost the three match series in the first two matches with crushing victories. England won the final game largely thanks to Joe Root’s 122 in the second innings of the third Test, England’s only century of the series. Root had only scored 55 runs in the first five innings he played. It led Ian Chappell to say “Root deserves a kick up the backside” and Mark Taylor to say England “still don’t know what their best order is”. Having played 18-Tests across four series against England with two series in Australia and two in England, Lyon knows better than most that both sides will bring their A-game to the series, calling it the “pinnacle” of cricket for an Aussie player. While Lyon said there’s little to glean from England’s performance in the West Indies series, it’s given Australia a boost. “We know when they’re at home they’re a world-class side, you can’t really read into too much that has happened over in the Caribbean,” Lyon told news.com.au. “I’m not going to sit here and say anything like that but they’re a world-class side and have some superstars in their side and it’s going to be one hell of a challenge over there. But I’m quietly confident heading over to the Ashes, that’s for sure.” While England are still trying to work out their best side, particularly at the top of the order, Australia are all of a sudden overflowing with options. The darkness of the 2018 season has also led to the light at the end of the tunnel with several players putting their hands up. Kurtis Patterson, Marnus Labuschagne, Marcus Harris and young Will Pucovski have batted their way into the public consciousness with stunning performances throughout the summer while Usman Khawaja returned to form with a century in his last Test start against Sri Lanka. Four centuries in the last Test of the summer opened the floodgates with the second half of the Sheffield Shield competition set up for an exciting finish. With bowlers, Jhye Richardson has burst onto the scene with a stunning first series against Sri Lanka, while Daniel Worrall and Chris Tremain have had votes of confidence from legends and pundits as Ashes bolters. The glut of talent is a tremendous boost for Australia, which was calling out for stars to put their hands up at the start of the season. “It’s massive, you always want competition for spots side whether it’s for batting, keeping, bowling, no matter what it is,” Lyon said. “If you can have healthy competition within the squad and players pushing and putting their hands up for selection, it only means Australian cricket is going really well. I’m all for competition for spots, it’s only going to push you to get better and better and that will bring out the best stuff for Australian cricket. “When you bring new people into the squad, they bring a new vibe and new intensity and energy so it’s been a great summer for that. It’s exciting but it’s really healthy to have guys to be competing for spots. There are only 11 guys who can take the field in the first Ashes Test so there’s going to be guys pushing for selection and there’s going to be a big winter and lead up to the first Ashes Test. “It’s great to have young guys floating around and doing really well and that’s really going to push the senior guys to find a new level and to take Cricket Australia to a new level to hopefully regain the Ashes and bring the Ashes back home.” For Lyon, 2018 was a stunning year. The Aussie off-spinner took 49 wickets at an average of 34.02 with a huge 615.3 overs, 145.3 overs more than the next most used bowler in 2018, Sri Lanka’s Dilruwan Perera. He was the third highest wicket taker of the calendar year behind Perera (50) and South Africa’s Kagiso Rabada (52). It saw Lyon win the Test Player of the Year at the Australian Cricket Awards earlier this week and finish second for the Allan Border Medal behind winner Pat Cummins. The fiery quick said he picked spinner to claim Australian cricket’s biggest honour but Lyon didn’t quite buy it. “You can’t really rock up to the awards and say yeah I’m going to win it so that’s why Pat said it, but he’s been writing his speech for about two months,” Lyon laughed. “He’s a well deserved winner of the Allan Border Medal. “It’s definitely pleasing but it’s more about for me, playing my role inside the Australian cricket side and making sure we’re trying to win as many games and series of cricket as we can for Australia. Personally it was satisfying but there’s a still a lot of work I need to do and still a lot of learning to be done and there are two areas I can get better at so still a lot of work to do. “To be able to be recognised and a lot of votes from your peers is pretty special to be named Test Player of the Year that’s for sure.” Lyon is a man with plenty of nicknames, including the GOAT, standing for Greatest Of All Time, which he has held since he took his 142nd Test wicket to pass Hugh Trumble as the most prolific off-spinner for Australia. While most players would have it hung around their neck with a level of arrogance, it has endeared Lyon to generations of cricket fans, maybe through his clear reluctance to hold it. “In my eyes, Shane Warne is the greatest of all time - I’m not even close to Shane Warne is the only thing,” Lyon said. “The GOAT stuck and I’ve got young kids calling me the GOAT and young kids calling me Gary so it doesn’t matter where I go, people will call me what they want to call me, so it’s no stress on me.” Lyon is just 12 wickets behind Dennis Lillee with just Glen McGrath (563 wickets) and Warne (708) ahead of him. Former Australian spinner Ashley Mallett told The West Australian Lyon could pass Warne. While the gap seems insurmountable, Warne had 366 scalps from 84 Tests at 31 before retiring at 37. Lyon currently has played 86 Tests. “To be spoken about in the same sentence and Shane Warne and the likes of Glen McGrath and Dennis Lillee, is obviously pretty special,” Lyon admitted. “They’re true legends of the game and I’m still trying to find my way and really play my role for the Australian cricket team.” Before the Ashes, Lyon will aim to make the Australian one-day squad ahead of the World Cup in England. To start, he is set to go to India and the UAE with the squad in the hopes of being selected for the World Cup. But Lyon also praised the development of spinners in the Big Bash. Lyon was only able to play two Big Bash matches for the season but praised the likes of 19-year-old Lloyd Pope and 21-year-old Ben Manenti with the young spinners coming through the ranks. While he likes what he sees in the pair, he asked for patience as they develop into the future stars. “I believe the spinning landscape is pretty healthy,” Lyon said. “There are obviously a lot of young exciting cricketers coming up like Ben Manenti and Lloyd Pope especially from the Sixers. There’s a big job we have as Australian cricketers, especially spin bowlers and coaches need to allow these guys to mature and learn the game before they get thrown into the deep end if I’m brutally honest. The Big Bash has been absolutely brilliant for spinners and I think the class of Pope and Manenti especially is starting to shine through. It’s pretty exciting.” International cricket will be live and delayed on Kayo Sports from just $25 per month for two devices at once on Apple and Telstra TV, for Apple and Google Android smartphones, on web browsers and via Google Chromecast Ultra devices.

But it’s very exciting to be aligned with them.”<end_of_turn>

# Pets of the week for Sunday, Feb. 17, 2019

Flamingo Flamingo is an 8-month-old spayed cat looking for a home willing to adopt her and her friend Affie. Both cats are outgoing and social and spend their days playing and cuddling together in their foster home. Both cats are feline immunodeficiency virus positive but can still live long, happy lives. Since they are so attached and both have the same disease, they are required to go home together. To help them find their forever home sooner, their adoption fee is waived. They should do well with other pets if given slow and proper introductions. Talk to your vet first it you have other cats at home. They should also do fine with respectful children of all ages under parental guidance. Koi Koi is a 9-month-old, 46-pound male pitbull terrier mix looking for his forever family. Koi is very active, outgoing and affectionate. Koi is an energetic and playful puppy who needs an owner that has plenty of time to dedicate to his training and exercise routine. Koi keeps his kennel clean at the shelter when let out regularly but still has accidents over the long nights. He will need a consistent routine in his new home. We highly recommend crate training. He may do well with other dogs in the home. Since Koi has a rough play style, a dog meet with any resident dogs will be required to make sure it is a good match. He would do best in a home with children above toddler age as he is very strong and bouncy. Koi will need daily exercise to keep him on his best behavior. He would make a great running or hiking partner.<end_of_turn>

# Cedar Rapids Xavier 2020 LB Ethan Hurkett commits to Iowa

Iowa coach Fran McCaffery details what had to happen for last-second shot to work against Rutgers. He even tells you what the play is called. Listen: Mark Emmert, memmert@gannett.com Iowa has added a third in-state recruit to its 2020 football class. Cedar Rapids Xavier linebacker Ethan Hurkett, the Register's No. 8 in-state 2020 prospect, committed to the Hawkeyes this weekend, his strength coach, JC Moreau, announced via Twitter and later confirmed to the Register. "My parents and I just felt like Iowa is the right fit for me," Hurkett told the Register. "Coach (Kirk) Ferentz and Coach (Reese) Morgan and the whole staff are just down to earth guys. I feel comfortable at Iowa and I believe they have something special going on in Iowa City." The 6-foot-3, 230-pounder entered the offseason reporting interest from Iowa, Iowa State, Notre Dame and several FCS programs, including South Dakota. Iowa was his first and only offer, Moreau said. Hurkett likely projects as a middle linebacker, but he could play defensive end, too. He said Iowa coaches aren't sure which position he'll play yet. As a junior, Hurkett amassed 64 tackles, 10 solo tackles for loss and two solo sacks during the Saints' undefeated, Class 3A title run. He was named one of three linebackers on the Register's All-Iowa 3A team. Hurkett joins Dowling Catholic running back Gavin Williams and Lewis Central defensive tackle Logan Jones as the Hawkeyes' in-state haul for 2020. He is Iowa's sixth recruit in the class, overall. Hurkett is high school teammates with offensive lineman Josh Volk, who is a 2020 priority for Iowa and Iowa State. Matthew Bain covers college football and basketball recruiting for the Des Moines Register. He also helps out with Iowa and Iowa State football and basketball coverage for HawkCentral and Cyclone Insider. Contact him at mbain@dmreg.com and follow him on Twitter @MatthewBain_.<end_of_turn>

# Was I ever little?

Was I ever little?   Of course I was, but where is the proof?   I mean, if I ever have to prove it   all the evidence is disappearing   Now that my mother and father are gone   only my brother remembers me little. . .   And my sister, but then   they were little too.   So nobody really remembers   like I am wishing    Someone would remember me.   How my ears stuck out a little   And my eyes smiled.   I have a black and white image of myself   In the backyard by the pony's fence   in baggy pants and a jacket.   Not a memory. It's just a photo.   But I was that little.   Sandy, our Shetland pony   is hanging his head over the fence.   A lot has happened since then.   But I wish I could remember what was happening then   When I was little and    my eyes were smiling.<end_of_turn>

# Five expert travel hacks to avoid luggage woes

Find your way through the airline bag maze! Five expert travel hacks to avoid luggage woes The Mail on Sunday's Neil Simpson looks at how to prevent luggage woes EasyJet's new app lets you scan your bag at home to check the dimensions The sooner you pay for extra bags with airlines, the cheaper it will be Every week our Holiday Hero Neil Simpson takes an in-depth look at a brilliant holiday topic, doing all the legwork so you don't have to. This week he packs his bags and investigates the fast-changing world of holiday luggage... The right bags can make or break a holiday or weekend break. Too big and your cabin bag may be put in the hold. Too heavy and you'll risk hefty surcharges at check-in. Too flimsy and your case can come off the carousel half empty. Here are five ways to avoid a baggage fail. Size matters: Choosing the right carry-on bag is crucial to the success of your trip One: Go high-tech. The new easyJet app lets you scan your bag at home to check it meets the airline's hand-baggage requirements. If you have an iPhone 6S or newer, use the camera to measure the case – effectively putting your bag in a virtual version of an airport measuring slot. Bags are also going high-tech. The CX Compression-Expansion case from Briggs & Riley (about £500) lets you pile clothes high as the case expands by a third before compressing to a normal carry-on size. Two: Get the facts. Airlines constantly change their hand-baggage rules (Ryanair changed policies twice last year), so don't assume the bag you took last time will be accepted for free. And don't assume all airlines are broadly similar. Fly with Jet2 and you can take a generous 56 x 45 x 25cm bag into the cabin plus a handbag or laptop bag. Fly Ryanair and you can have only one 40 x 20 x 25cm bag, and it has to go under the seat in front of you. Maximum dimensions include wheels and handles, and most airlines reserve the right to weigh hand baggage as well. With BA you can board with a hefty 23kg of cabin bags. With TUI and Thomas Cook, the limit can be just 5kg and you can pay up to £18 per kilo for any excess. Get the best: Size isn't everything when it comes to suitcases and durability counts, too Three: Get organised. The sooner you pay for extra bags, the cheaper it will be. Fly Air France and you'll pay £61 to check in two extra bags in advance. Wait till check-in and it's £30 more. Jet2 charges a £45 airport fee if you bring an unexpected extra bag to check-in. Standard allowances also vary hugely between airlines. On most BA tickets, you can normally check in up to two bags free. With Virgin it's one bag and with Aer Lingus it can be zero. Four: Get the best. Size isn't everything when it comes to suitcases. Durability counts, too. That's why researchers at Which? road-test dozens of bags every year – a £1 trial subscription gets you access to individual reports on cases ranging from £30 to £1,140. The Good Housekeeping Institute does a similar job and its top three bags (available in cabin and check-in sizes) are American Tourister Bon Air (from £100), Samsonite Lite-cube DLX 4-wheel (from £365) and Samsonite Uplite 4-wheel (from £155). Five: Get help. If you don't want to drag your suitcases to the airport, you don't have to. Delivery firm AirPortr will collect bags from your home or workplace up to 48 hours before you depart. Bags are sealed, weighed, X-rayed and put on your plane, so you pick them off the carousel at your destination like everyone else. The service (which also takes golf clubs and prams) starts at £30 a bag and operates for people flying with the likes of BA, Virgin or easyJet out of Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton.

# Audi Teases Q4 e-Tron Ahead Of 2019 Geneva Motor Show Reveal - NDTV CarAndBike

Audi has released the sketch of the Q4 e-Tron which the company is all set to bring to the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. The company calls the Q4 e-Tron a compact SUV study with electric drive. While Audi has already confirmed that it's all set to bring in a gasoline powered Q4 soon, which will slot between the Q3 and the Q5, at Geneva this year, the company will bring the electric version of the Q4.  The two sketches released by Audi show the pre-production version of the Q4 SUV. Audi plans to launch the Q4 in the European markets by the second half of 2019; but the electric version of the car or e-tron is expected to come by late 2020 or early 2021. There are no details about what powers the e-tron or the range it will have. The company calls the Q4 e-tron a glimpse of the next stage of Audi electric mobility. From the sketches provided by the company, you can see that the Q4 e-Tron is a small crossover. It gets a face similar to the e-tron or even the e-tron GT that we've already seen. The sketch of the Q4 e-tron shows some similarity in design to the Q4 crossover too especially the roofline. Clearly it's a coupe crossover and Audi wants to make most of the opportunity to address that part of the market. Expect a lot of features and even design elements to trickle down from the Q8 into the Q4 but we'll know more about the car closer to the unveil.<end_of_turn>

# Luciano Spalletti Left Frustrated After Mauro Icardi Fails to Celebrate Inter's Win Over Sampdoria

Luciano Spalletti was left frustrated after Mauro Icardi failed to celebrate Inter's 2-1 over Sampdoria with the rest of his teammates.  After a turbulent week, which saw Icardi stripped of the captaincy and banished from the squad, Inter went on to earn all three points in his absence, with second-half strikes from Danilo D'Ambrosio and Radja Nainggolan proving to be the difference.  "I really appreciated that he was in the stadium and I would've appreciated it even more if he had come to the dressing room to celebrate with us afterwards, because it was a very important victory for the team and he is part of this group, so I imagine he was as happy with the win as we were," he said, as per Goal.  "We want a return to normality. In a team, in a dressing room you all need to be working in the same direction.  "There are more steps to take, which are for him to come to the dressing room, to enjoy being a part of this very good group, to relish wearing Inter's glorious shirt.  "It's just frustrating that we keep getting tied up in all this talk around Inter. I've had some situations in my career with a lot of attention, but never like this."  After a frustrating start to 2019, Spalletti went to add that the win meant much more than just the three points.  "I really liked the applause from our fans after the equaliser, as they urged us to get right back on track and gave us strength in that difficult moment.  "The victory is a sign of maturity, so we can begin to get past the mountain of things that are constantly spoken about Inter."<end_of_turn>

# Roger Stone sorry for judge crosshair post

Roger Stone sorry for judge crosshair post  Roger Stone has apologised to a US judge after posting on Instagram an image of her next to what appeared to be the cross-hairs of a gun sight. The ex-Trump campaign adviser was arrested in January and charged with seven counts as part of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. In a comment alongside the image of Judge Jackson, who is overseeing his trial, Mr Stone called the special counsel a "deep state hit-man". Mr Stone's post, now taken down, also called the legal proceedings a "show trial" and Judge Jackson "a [former US President Barack] Obama appointed judge who dismissed the Benghazi charges against Hillary Clinton". In 2017, Judge Jackson dismissed legal action against Mrs Clinton taken by the parents of two of the four Americans killed in a 2012 attack on the US consulate in Libya. Judge Jackson also dismissed a related claim Mrs Clinton, who was US secretary of State at the time, had defamed the parents by lying about them in the press. In a letter filed with the court, Mr Stone wrote: "Please inform the court that the photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted. "I had no intention of disrespecting the court and humbly apologise to the court for the transgression." He also posted on Instagram: "A photo of Judge Jackson posted on my Instagram has been misinterpreted. "This was a random photo taken from the internet. "Any inference that this was meant to somehow threaten the judge or disrespect court is categorically false."<end_of_turn>

# How do I SORN my car? What is Statutory Off Road Notification and will I be exempt from car tax?

There are many reasons someone may wish to take their car off the road - and a SORN is the best way to save money on road tax and insurance.  If you need time to get the money together for repairing your car, or want to work on a vehicle before you drive it, here’s how to get a Statutory Off Road Notification.  What is Statutory Off Road Notification or SORN?  A Statutory Off Road Notification is a declaration made by the registered owner of a vehicle that they are removing their car from the public highway.  By doing this, the person will no longer need to pay road tax, as the notification tells the DVLA that a vehicle is registered but not currently being used. Those who have their insurance and road tax expire and don’t want to renew them may find it makes more sense to declare a SORN instead.  When do I have to make a SORN?  If one of the following situations applies to your vehicle you will need to declare a Statutory Off Road Notification:  You haven’t paid tax for your vehicle You haven’t paid insurance for your vehicle You want to break a vehicle down for parts before scrapping it You purchase or receive a vehicle and don’t want to put it on the road If you’ve sold a vehicle and been sent a V11 reminder letter, you won’t need to make a SORN, as you’ll receive a confirmation that you no longer have the vehicle within 4 weeks of informing DVLA you’ve sold it.  How do I declare a SORN?  People wanting to declare a Statutory Off Road Notification can go to the DVLA website to fill out the necessary details. You will receive a refund for any full months of remaining tax, and won’t be able to use the vehicle on the road until you tax it again.  If you want to start the SORN immediately, use the 11 digit number on your vehicle log book (V5C).  If you want it to begin on the first day of the following month, use the 16-digit number on your vehicle tax reminder letter (V11) - but bear in mind this number can only be used once.  If the vehicle isn’t registered in your name you will need to tell the DVLA it’s off the road by post.  You can also send applications in the mail by filling in the V890 application form, or calling the DVLA vehicle service.  more on cars What rules do I have to follow once I’ve declared a SORN?  Once you’ve made a SORN, your car has to remain off the road and either stored in a garage or kept on private land.  If your car is on the road in any way, it has to be taxed and insured - which includes parking it on a curb and leaving it there.  If your road tax expires, the DVLA will assume your vehicle is off the road, so if you don’t keep your tax up to date, you could be issued an £80 penalty for no road tax - or £100 if the car is uninsured.<end_of_turn>

# Sen. Bernie Sanders enters the 2020 presidential race

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday said on Vermont Public Radio that he is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The Vermont senator’s official announcement video is expected to stream online Tuesday morning. “I wanted to let the people of the state of Vermont know about this first,” Sanders told Vermont Public radio. “And what I promise to do is, as I go around the country, is to take the values that all of us in Vermont are proud of — a belief in justice, in community, in grassroots politics, in town meetings — that’s what I’m going to carry all over this country.” Sanders also ran in the 2016 presidential election, finishing as runner up in the Democratic primary behind Hillary Clinton. By focusing on income equality and frequently criticizing the country’s “millionaires and billionaires,” Sanders’ underdog campaign received a surge of grassroots support from young voters. 
Andrew McCabe told 60 Minutes that he and Rod Rosenstein discussed the 25th Amendment in regards to removing President Trump. Owen Shroyer breaks down how this is an admitted coup.<end_of_turn>

	Mumbai: Though the BJP and Shiv Sena have inked a seat-sharing pact for the upcoming elections, top leaders of both the parties seem to be speaking in different voices over which party will get the post of chief minister after the Maharashtra assembly elections, due later this year.  The Uddhav Thackeray-led party has been vocal about its demand for the post of chief minister post the elections. 
			 According to the tie-up announced on Monday, the BJP sill contest 25 seats and Sena 23 of total 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra.  For the assembly polls, the two parties will contest an equal number of seats after accommodating allies.  The BJP and Sena had contested the 2014 assembly elections separately. Of the total 288 seats, the BJP had won 122 seats, while Sena candidates won from 63 constituencies.  On Tuesday night, Thackeray told select party workers at his residence here that he had rejected the poll formula proposing that the party winning maximum number of seats in assembly elections would get the post of chief minister.  Thackeray said he had demanded that both the parties get equal number of posts.  "This formula was used by both the parties (Sena and BJP) in the last 25 years. I have rejected it. What I have demanded is that both the parties get to share all posts equally," Thackeray told the party workers.  "The BJP has agreed to this, hence I have decided to forge an alliance," he said.  On the contrary, state revenue minister Chandrakant Patil said the BJP's stand is that the party winning more number of seats would get the post of chief minister even though "We will contest on equal number of seats in the assembly polls".  Sources in the BJP, however, said the party has achieved its objective to secure a section of votes in Lok Sabha polls by tying up with Sena.  According to sources, the Sena's main focus during negotiations with BJP mainly remained on the assembly elections.

# Samsung updates Galaxy Apps with OneUI, changes name to Galaxy Store

Samsung is in the midst of a big software redesign on its Android devices. Little by little, the company's phones are getting the Pie update, and with that comes OneUI. It's also rolling out new official apps to go with it, like the latest update to Galaxy Apps. Oops, that's "Galaxy Store" now.   The newly renamed Galaxy Store is Samsung' storefront for apps and games, the most prominent of which is Fortnite. It's also where you go to get apps for the company's Tizen-based wearables. The functionality seems unchanged, but the Galaxy Store has all the usual OneUI curves. However, users report it doesn't work with Samsung's dark mode in Pie. That seems like a major oversight.  The updated store is rolling out now, and it's a mandatory update—the old version won't launch anymore. You can also update by sideloading the new version from APK Mirror. It's v4.5.01.7. In addition to the name change, the app icon is a bit different. Feel free to compare the new and old ones on APK Mirror.  Source:<end_of_turn>

# Watch: David And Tamela Mann Release Music Video For ‘Mason Jar’

Sign Up For Our Newsletter! The visual for the song, which comes from their joint album Us Against The World, begins with an intimate sit-down with Tamela who expresses how she once desired to be love but lacked it coming up as a kid when all of her friends had boyfriends. She says she doubted her beauty and attributed her relationship status to her weight before she met David.  “To finally find love in somebody loved me…this is a love I never thought would happen,” she said.  While “Mason Jar” speaks to cherishing their moments together, the couple reflects on the happiness of their marriage with scenes from their wedding and renewing of their vows. It also closes with an equally yoked Bible verse from 1 Corinthians 13:13 that reads, “And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.”  Grab your tissues and watch below:     Watch: David And Tamela Mann Release Music Video For ‘Mason Jar’ was originally published on getuperica.com<end_of_turn>

# The Telecoms.com Podcast: Huawei, 6G & Smartphones | Light Reading

It wouldn't be a 2019 Telecoms.com podcast without a fair bit of chat about Huawei, so the guys look to get it out of the way first this week. Then, just for a laugh, they decide to have a go at 6G even though 5G hasn't even got going yet, and we'll let you determine whether or not that was a good idea. With MWC nearly upon us, they conclude with a look at the smartphone market and wonder if it will ever surprise us again.

# 'Wheels came off': Head of State corporate watchdog says lessons learned after failures in Anglo trial

THE HEAD OF the State’s corporate watchdog has told an Oireachtas Committee “the wheels came off” of his office’s probe into former Anglo Irish Bank chairman Sean Fitzpatrick.  Ian Drennan said today that its investigation into Fitzpatrick and the loans at the bank “went wrong in a catastrophic way”.  In May 2017, the judge in the trial of the former Anglo chairman had said that he would be directing the jury to acquit Fitzpatrick due to “alarming flaws in the prosecution”.  Fitzpatrick had been on trial accused of a number of offences and the trial had been ongoing for 126 days before it was struck out of court, and he was acquitted on all charges.  Among these flaws identified by Judge John Aylmer were the coaching of witnesses and the cross-contamination between witness statements. The flaws were such that he felt FitzPatrick would be denied his right a fair trial.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) carried out the investigation into FitzPatrick and Judge Aylmer was critical of its conduct.  In the wake of the trial, Minister Simon Harris said the government couldn’t express confidence in the ODCE.  Harris acknowledged the role of the state in the collapsed trial, but said that as far as he knew, the ODCE had told the government that they had adequate resources.   The question is how does the ODCE interact with the courts, and with the Director of Public Prosecutions. I cannot, and the government cannot, express confidence in this office.  The ODCE’s Drennan was addressing the Oireachtas Business Committee on proposals from the government to establish the ODCE as a stand-alone agency, in order to strengthen the regulatory framework with which Ireland can tackle white-collar crime.  He said today that the failures made his office in relation to the Fitzpatrick trial were “fully acknowledged” and that “valuable lessons” had been learned, adding that the blame for the trial’s collapse did not lie solely with the ODCE.  He also said that the scale of the wider probe into Anglo was “completely unprecedented”, and the ODCE wasn’t equipped to deal with it.  Nevertheless, Drennan also defended the ODCE’s conduct and said that four out of five of its Anglo probes resulted in convictions.  “Hindsight is 20/20,” he said. “Five separate strands of investigation, and each on their own was enormous… things go wrong and unfortunately in this case things went wrong in a catastrophic way. Things went wrong.”<end_of_turn>

# Preston school launches own currency

When it comes to innovative teaching methods, pupils at Eldon Primary know they can bank on their teachers.  And banking on success is literally what the latest initiative at the Preston school is. 
The Bank of Eldon is officially up and running and even has its own currency, with pupils being “paid” to do jobs around school. 
The idea came after headteacher Azra Butt attended a forum in Liverpool where governors from the Bank of England expressed fear that adults don’t understand economics and raised concerns about young people starting out steeped in debt from student loans. 
Azra said: “It was really pitched at high schools but as a primary school head I came away thinking that we should be doing something earlier. 
“We already have systems in place here where the children can do little jobs in school, like salad bar monitors, anti-bullying ambassadors, play leaders etc. 
“But we don’t actually have any reward fort his work. 
“So, with the school council, we discussed it and decided to launch our own currency.” 
The pupils are eager to sign up and have to apply for jobs, and for a bank account. 
They are monthly and can use the cash to buy a range of treats from £E5 for first place in the dinner queue to £E50 for a party at Eldon House. 
The privileges have been compiled by the school council and since bank was launched at a glittering back tie event at school for parents Azra said the scheme has snowballed. 
She added: “We’ve had the currency printed off and it, the bank, has raised all sorts of questions among the children, such as interest rates and what value they can put on actual jobs.” 
The school’s efforts saw them receive a visit from John Young from the Bank of England North West team.<end_of_turn>

# Study: U.S. Ambassador Picks Are Increasingly Unqualified for Foreign Diplomacy

Are ambassadors appointed by President Trump less qualified than in previous administrations and what role have political contributions played in assigning the diplomatic posts?  These are questions studied in a recent academic report that considers presidential-appointed ambassadors, as opposed to those who are career diplomats.  According to Marquette University Law School’s Ryan Scoville, the ambassadors appointed by Trump are less qualified. This is part of a trend over presidencies in nearly four decades, with some exceptions, he concludes.  Moreover, ambassadorial appointees increasingly represent big campaign contributors, with Trump’s nominees setting new records.  Scoville found that in the first two years of the Trump administration, 42% of ambassadorships were filled by appointments—the highest percentage since President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who appointed 46%. On average, 30% of ambassadorships are political appointees.  Of the current ambassadors appointed by Trump, 29% made financial contributions to him, up from 22% under President Reagan.  Furthermore, these contributions to Trump dwarf those of political appointees under any other president. For example, the average Trump campaign donation by political-appointee ambassadors was $89,632, up from $4,300 for President Ronald Reagan, suggesting that political contributions are increasingly considered when making ambassadorial appointments, Scoville concludes.  Political nominees are also less likely to be qualified for their role, Scoville maintains. The study cites language skills and knowledge of regions where politically appointed ambassadors are assigned. Scoville said 52% of Trump’s appointees can speak the language of their host country, in contrast to 62% under Reagan. Only 5% of current ambassadorial appointees have experience in the region they serve, compared to 26% during Reagan’s presidency.  Additionally, the study finds a considerable decrease in qualifications regarding foreign policy and leadership experience.  Of Trump’s appointees, 32% have worked in foreign policy, down from 64% under Reagan. Leadership experience is equally disproportionate, with 58% of Trump’s ambassadorial appointees having the qualification, compared to 77% in the Reagan administration.<end_of_turn>

# Afghan Loya Jirga To Convene Next Month To Discuss Peace Talks

KABUL -- Afghan politicians and tribal, ethnic, and religious leaders are set to meet for at least four days next month to discuss negotiations with the Taliban, President Ashraf Ghani's special peace envoy has said. 
 
Omar Daudzai said on February 20 that the gathering, known as a Loya Jirga, will be held from March 17-20, adding: “If the discussions continue, it will be extended.” 
 
Daudzai said that the consultative Loya Jirga will discuss the government's "values and red lines" and will aim to come up with a framework for the Western-backed government in Kabul to engage in peace negotiations with the militant group. The Taliban, which now reportedly controls nearly half of Afghanistan, has so far refused to hold direct negotiations with the Afghan government, calling it a Western puppet. 
 
However, it has held a series of direct talks with U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in recent months to put an end to the 17-year war in Afghanistan. 
 
Speaking at an event organized by the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) in Kabul, Daudzai said that most Afghan politicians want these talks to lay the groundwork for direct negotiations between the Taliban and Kabul. 
 
AIHRC head Sima Samer warned that using human rights as a bargaining chip in the talks with the Taliban would undermine any peace agreement. 
 
U.S. Ambassador John Bass emphasized that the final goal of the talks was "peace and dignity" for the people of Afghanistan. 
 
Khalilzad is scheduled to meet Taliban negotiators for talks in Qatar on February 25. 
 
During their previous round of talks in Doha, the Qatari capital, U.S. and Taliban negotiators reached the basic framework of a possible peace deal. 
 
The agreement calls for the Taliban to prevent international terrorist groups from basing themselves in Afghanistan and for the United States to withdraw its forces from the country. 
 
U.S. troops have been in Afghanistan since an October 2001 invasion that brought down the Taliban government after it refused to hand over Al-Qaeda terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, blamed for launching the September 11, 2001, in the United States. 
 
Taliban leaders, who took control in 1996, imposed a harsh form of Islamic law that denied education and work to women and girls as they cracked down on other social activities.<end_of_turn>

# We Collected and Published ISIS’ Internal Documents. What Questions Do You Have?

The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. The recent publication of “The ISIS Files,” an investigation by Rukmini Callimachi, our terrorism correspondent, into thousands of internal Islamic State documents, has led to a thought-provoking conversation among our readers on the ethical and legal considerations journalists make when reporting in a war zone. Rukmini and her team recovered the documents, including birth certificates, tax forms and citations for bad behavior, over five trips to Iraq. Since the article came out in April, some academics and others have asked about The Times’s right to collect and hold on to these papers, if other researchers will be able to use them and whether names should have been redacted. We’re using this as an opportunity to have a deeper discussion with our readers about this investigation and the issues the collection of the documents raised. Michael Slackman, our International editor; Rukmini; and David McCraw, our deputy general counsel, will respond to a selection of them in a coming piece.<end_of_turn>

# AAF Week 3 odds, picks: Atlanta Legends cover spread against Birmingham Iron, San Diego Fleet win again

AAF Week 3 odds, picks: Atlanta Legends cover spread against Birmingham Iron, San Diego Fleet win again  Wonder who'll win in Week 3 of the Alliance of American Football? You've come to the right place  If we've learned anything through the first two weeks of the season, it's that playing on the road is a bear. Shocker, right? But even the Alliance's best team, , needed a late pick-six to seal a road victory in Week 2. While it's still to be determined how much value we should assign to home-field advantage -- is it greater than three points? -- we can deduce that going on the road means it's hard to cover. Only twice so far has a road team covered, both in Week 2. As the AAF moves into its third week, we find, again, some top-four teams in perilous spots. The Arizona Hotshots and Birmingham Iron go on the road to Salt Lake City and Atlanta, respectively, as one-score favorites; the San Antonio Commanders are actually a two-point dog at the San Diego Fleet. Will this introduce the first round of chaos into the AAF's regular season? It's time to parse through all four games on Saturday and Sunday. Lines are courtesy of MGM. Arizona Hotshots (-3) at Salt Lake Stallions, O/U 46 An intriguingly small line here for the top team in the West on the road against a winless team. This was a 16-point win for the Hotshots in Tempe just two weeks ago -- and Salt Lake had its starting quarterback, Josh Woodrum, for a half before he injured his hamstring. Obviously, Woodrum's health is a factor in whether the Stallions can cover. Playing at home for the first time should help, and given that these two teams know each other already, I'll side with the defenses making enough plays to sweat the under. Arizona has just enough big-play ability to cover, though. Pick: Hotshots -3, Under 46 Memphis Express at Orlando Apollos (-13.5), O/U 45.5 The Express covered against (and nearly beat) Arizona in Week 2 because of poor ball security and execution by the Hotshots. In all, Arizona had five turnovers (two on downs, two interceptions and one fumble). Otherwise, there still wasn't a lot of life from Memphis' offense (3.5 yards per play). They'll be going up against the best offense in the AAF, and certainly the best passing offense. Meanwhile, Memphis gives up seven yards per attempt through the air, second-worst in the Alliance. Though I'm wary of a spread this big, the Apollos are rolling. Pick: Apollos -13.5, Over 45.5 Birmingham Iron (-6) at Atlanta Legends, O/U 40 Finally, Atlanta gets a home game. Unfortunately, it's against the Iron, a team that makes you feel as though you're playing football in a swamp with lead shoes. And Birmingham boasts the best passing defense and second-best overall defense in yards per play. The Legends are winless, which means they'll be playing angry. They certainly looked improved from Week 1 to Week 2. I'll give them the cover, but this is setting up to be a low-scoring rock fight. Pick: Legends +6, Under 40 San Antonio Commanders at San Diego Fleet (-2), O/U 43.5 How will the Commanders respond after losing an intense, emotional game on Sunday to the Apollos? A road trip to San Diego, a familiar opponent, won't be easy -- especially not since the Fleet have a win under their belt. We also don't know how San Antonio is going to do on the road for the first time, but away teams are 2-6 against the spread. I'm still concerned about San Diego's O-line -- it took the offense seven quarters into the season to score their first touchdown -- but I think they catch San Antonio at a good time. I wouldn't be surprised if, once again, this one is low scoring and anyone's game going into the fourth quarter. Pick: Fleet -2, Under 43.5

# Cowboys appoint Johnathan Thurston as an official club ambassador

North Queensland have appointed retired NRL star Johnathan Thurston as an official Cowboys club ambassador.  The 35-year-old has accepted the role of Elite Partnerships Ambassador, which entails working with the club's commerical and community teams to build connections with industry partners. He has already started his new role and will visit Papua New Guinea as one of his first assignments. Thurston, who is also a Cowboys life member, described his new ambassadorship as a 'natural fit' given his long tenure with the club. "I love the club and this community and always wanted to continue to be involved in making this an even greater place to live, work and raise a family," Thurston told the club's website. "I'm enjoying life and having the time to think about where I can make a difference, and where I want to be. "Coming back home to the Cowboys feels like a natural fit for me and the chance to work off-field with their highly-regarded team of professionals is a fantastic opportunity for me." NORTH QUEENSLAND COWBOYS 2019: 2019 preview, draw, squad changes, news, every player, odds and ticketing Signing with North Queensland back in 2005, the retired halfback holds a 294 match record with the club. After just two years with the club Thurston went on to captain the team between 2007 to 2018, which included eight finals series, the 2015 NRL Premiership and 2016 World Club Challenge. Outside the sport, he has also worked with the Indigenous communities in North Queensland and the Australian Red Cross, as well as setting up the Johnathan Thurston Academy. Cowboys CEO Jeff Reibel said the club were looking forward to continuing their work with Thurston beyond his playing career. "It was always our ambition to have Johnathan continue in an off-field role with us in his rugby league retirement," Reibel said. "There's no question that very few individuals hold the influence and reputation that JT does, and his commercial acumen will be a great asset to our team. "We're looking forward to having JT's competitive edge and insights with us on the other side of the club."<end_of_turn>

# Off the Vine: This year's wine trends hot off the vine

In the classic 1939 film "The Wizard of Oz," kindly fortune teller Professor Marvel peers into his crystal ball telling Dorothy that she must return home because her Aunt Em is distraught due to the young girl's disappearance. Now I’m no fortune teller nor do I have a crystal ball, but I am fascinated as to what the future may bring and that certainly holds true for wine. Over the past few months I’ve been gathering information that hopefully gives wine lovers some indication as to what trends will become popular throughout the upcoming year. For instance, rising alcohol levels in wine continue to stir heated debate, which in turn may prompt some changes. Many would agree that elevated levels of alcohol can mask the true appeal of the wine. That in turn can affect everything from aroma and taste to how the wine pairs with food. Therefore, expect to hear more dialogue about balance in winemaking and a reinforcement of the concept that wine is an integral part of a meal rather than a high-alcohol-induced beverage. We might even see a reduction of alcohol levels by some producers. Buying trends is another hot topic. A recent survey of wine lovers found that a majority place price as the main reason for purchasing wine. Does that mean that folks will be rushing out to find the latest version of Two-Buck Chuck? Not likely - what this tells me is that most wine lovers will be searching for well-made wines that are reasonably priced, no surprise there. However, interest in less traditional wine regions and varietals is becoming more common. South America is certainly at the top of the list, specifically Chile and Argentina where good solid values can be found in wines like malbec, cabernet sauvignon, Carmenere and torrontes to name a few. Equally popular, shiraz and semillon from Australia are two varietals worthy of consideration. Again, these wines are well-made and fairly priced. Wines poised to make a strong comeback include rose, caberent franc and riesling. Often overlooked, these wines offer abundant drinking pleasure, especially in the hands of talented winemakers and producers. Look toward Germany, France and the Pacific Northwest for some terrific wines. If you’re feeling really adventurous, check out Austria, Portugal, Greece and Moldova, all of which have a long track record of winemaking. Wine and the environment are issues taking center stage. Any winemaker worth his or her salt will tell you that you can't produce good wine in an unhealthy environment. That’s why you’ll be hearing more about organic and biodynamic wine and winemaking. To be labeled as organic, wines - at least here in the US - must forgo the use of artificial chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides and herbicides. For those who seek everything organic, wine shelves across the nation will continue to feature labels that will satisfy not only your palate but your social consciousness as well. Biodynamic, on the other hand, is a philosophy that views the vineyard as a whole and believes that agriculture can be attuned to spiritual forces. Either way, these trends are something wine lovers are going to hear more about. Keep in mind that what’s relevant today can become totally moot with the blink of an eye. Nonetheless, many of the topics noted have far-reaching implications and therefore, I believe, will remain important for some time to come. Cheers! Wine of the Week: Robert Mondavi, 2015 Oakville District Fume Blanc, California. Bright gold color with white peach, lemon and lime aromas. Refreshing with sharp, crisp flavors and a creamy finish. $40<end_of_turn>

# Supporters of Guaidó and Maduro clashed outside the Venezuelan embassy in San Jose

Supporters of Juan Guaidó and Nicolás Maduro clashed Wednesdau morning outside the Venezuela embassy in Los Yoses, on the east side of San Jose.  The clash occurred after diplomatic officials of Guaidó, the self-proclaimed president of Venezuela, took possession of the Embassy of Venezuela in Costa Rica, thus disregarding the 60-day period that the Costa Rican government had given Maduro officials to leave the country.  The representative of Guaidó, María Faría, clashed with officials of Maduro who were preparing to begin their work day. A significant number of Venezuelan citizens were present at the diplomatic mission, as well as some Costa Ricans.   #Ahora | En el cumplimento de las funciones diplomáticas, asignadas por el pdte @jguaido y reconocidas por el Gob. Costa Rica, asumimos el control de la sede administrativa de la Embajada de Venezuela en San José. Pendientes brindaremos información importante. #20Feb pic.twitter.com/2pGaZytTPI  — Maria A Faria F (@Mandyfaria26) February 20, 2019 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs censured the actions of Faría and her group.  “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs deplored the unacceptable entry to the headquarters of the embassy, by diplomatic personnel of Juan Guaidó.  “For the Government of Costa Rica, such a procedure is unacceptable because it injures elementary diplomatic norms of respect and trust in relations in the international community; and above all, international law,” said Foreign Minister Lorena Aguilar.  The Government of Costa Rica has recognized Juan Guaidó as interim president of Venezuela, and Maria Faria as the new ambassador in the country.  Last week President Carlos Alvarado asked Maduro’s diplomats to leave the country.  Through a press release on February 16, Faria said Maduro officials would not let her take possession as an ambassador.<end_of_turn>

# Solving the jet/cocoon riddle of a gravitational wave event

An international research team including astronomers from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, has combined radio telescopes from five continents to prove the existence of a narrow stream of material, a so-called jet, emerging from the only gravitational wave event involving two neutron stars ever observed. With its high sensitivity and excellent performance, the 100-meter radio telescope in Effelsberg played an important role in the observations. In August 2017, two neutron stars were observed colliding, producing gravitational waves that were detected by the American LIGO and European Virgo detectors. Neutron stars are ultra-dense stars, roughly the same mass as the Sun, but similar in size to a city like Cologne. This event is the first and only one of this type that has been observed so far, and it happened in a galaxy 130 million light-years away from Earth, in the constellation of Hydra.  Astronomers observed the event and the subsequent evolution across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma-rays, X-rays to visible light and radio waves. Two hundred days after the merger, observations combining radio telescopes in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, and North America proved the existence of a jet emerging from this violent collision. These findings are now published in the scientific journal Science by an international team of astronomers, led by Giancarlo Ghirlanda from the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF).  This neutron star merger represented the first case where it was possible to associate a detection of gravitational waves to an object emitting light. The event has confirmed scientific theories that have been under discussion for tens of years, and the association of neutron star mergers with one of the most powerful explosions in the universe: gamma-ray bursts. After the merger, a huge amount of material was expelled into space, forming a shell around the object. Astronomers have been tracing its evolution at different wavelengths. However, there were still some remaining questions concerning this event that could not be clarified by any previous observations.  "We expected part of the material to be ejected through a collimated jet, but it was unclear whether this material could successfully pierce through the surrounding shell," explains Ghirlanda. "There were two competing scenarios: In one case, the jet cannot break through the shell, instead generating an expanding bubble around the object. In the other, the jet is successful in penetrating the shell and then propagates further into space," expands Tiziana Venturi (INAF). Only the acquisition of very sensitive radio images with very high resolution would discard one scenario or the other. This required the use of a technique known as very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) that allows astronomers to combine radio telescopes all around the Earth.  The authors of this publication conducted global observations in the direction of the merger on 12 March 2018 using thirty-three radio telescopes from the European VLBI Network (that connects telescopes from Spain, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Poland, Latvia, South Africa, Russia, and China), e-MERLIN in the UK, the Australian Long Baseline Array in Australia and New Zealand, and the Very Long Baseline Array in the USA.  "Our 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg participated in the observations and was a key element, due to its high sensitivity and excellent performance," says Carolina Casadio, a member of the research team from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR).  The data from all telescopes were sent to JIVE, The Netherlands, where the most advanced processing techniques were used to produce an image with a resolution comparable to resolving a person on the surface of the Moon. In the same analogy, the expanding bubble would appear with an apparent size equivalent to a truck on the Moon, whereas a successful jet would be detected as a much more compact object. "Comparing the theoretical images with the real ones, we find that only a jet could appear sufficiently compact to be compatible with the observed size," explains Om Sharan Salafia from INAF in Italy. The team determined that this jet contained as much energy as produced by all the stars in our galaxy during one year. "And all that energy was contained in a size smaller than one light-year," says Zsolt Paragi, also from JIVE.  "Within Europe we utilize the RadioNet consortium for an efficient use of our members' radio telescopes. The observations described here combine radio observatories all over Europe and world wide. They require a well-coordinated effort of the collaborating observatories and institutions to achieve such exciting results," explains Anton Zensus, Director at MPIfR and coordinator of the RadioNet consortium.  In the coming years, many more of these neutron star binary mergers will be discovered. "The obtained results also suggest that more than 10 percent of all these mergers should exhibit a successful jet," explains Benito Marcote from JIVE. "These types of observations will allow us to unveil the processes that take place during and after some of the most powerful events in the universe," concludes Sándor Frey from the Konkoly Observatory in Hungary.

# Worrying figures reveal just how long patients have to wait in ambulances outside Preston hospital

Hundreds of patients were left waiting up to an hour in ambulances outside Lancashire Teaching Hospitals this winter, contravening a key NHS safety standard.  Unison said delays risk the safety of patients and are "a terrible waste" of ambulance crews' skills. Ambulances took 6,323 patients to emergency departments at the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust between December 3 and February 3, according to NHS Digital data. Of those, 284 waited between 30 and 60 minutes before A&E staff were able to take over from paramedics, and 58 arrivals waited for more than an hour. Despite the NHS saying a delay of just 15 minutes is a potential threat to life, 23 patients waited up to an hour in a single day when the problem was at its most severe. The overall number of delays at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals has plummeted since 2017-18. Over the same period last winter, 2,366 patients waited in ambulances for 30 minutes or more, 86 per cent more than this year. Colm Porter, Unison's national ambulance officer, said: "Handover delays are a stark illustration of the extreme pressure on the NHS caused by years of chronic underfunding. "Not only are patients put at risk with lengthy waits to get into A&E, but there are also fewer ambulances available to respond to emergencies. "Ambulance staff are stuck in hospitals when they should be out responding to life-or-death 999 calls. This is a terrible waste of their skills and the stress it causes can soon takes its toll on their health." The Society for Acute Medicine said emergency staff are only too aware that waiting in the back of an ambulance is inherently less safe for patients. President Dr Nick Scriven said: "Staff will be forced to make horrible decisions about who gets the next space when one becomes free, fully aware that any mistakes could be catastrophic." NHS bosses have stressed that A&Es should always accept handover of patients within 15 minutes of arrival by ambulance. An NHS spokesperson said: "Thanks to the hard work of ambulance and hospitals more people have benefited from a timely handover this year, despite a significant increase in people requiring care. "We remain committed to further reducing delayed handovers, so that ambulance crews are able to get back out on the road and providing care to patients sooner.” Across England, nearly 100,000 people waited for 30 minutes or more between December and February - one in 10 arrivals.<end_of_turn>

# WATCH: Nike in social media storm after basketball star's shoe breaks on court | IOL News

New York - A Nike Inc sneaker worn by a college basketball superstar split in half less than a minute into a highly anticipated game between Duke University and North Carolina, prompting an outcry on social media as the company sought to figure out what caused the problem.  Zion Williamson, a 6-foot-7-inch freshman forward for the Duke Blue Devils who is anticipated to be the top 2019 NBA Draft pick, suffered a mild sprain to his right knee because of the incident on Wednesday night, according to his coach Mike Krzyzewski.  The official Duke Basketball Twitter handle (@DukeMBB) tweeted Thursday evening that Zion was "progressing as expected, and his status is day-to-day."

His left shoe is seen split in half, with part of the sole ripped off the base of the sneaker.   Zion Williamson's Nikes explode 😱 pic.twitter.com/ER0OZLRsNM — TOM MARTIN (@TomKCTV5) February 21, 2019 Williamson did not return to play in the match-up, which ended with No. 1-ranked Duke losing 72-88 to the No. 8-ranked Tar Heels team.  "We are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery," Nike said in a statement. "The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance. While this is an isolated occurrence, we are working to identify the issue."  Shares of the sportswear maker closed down 1 percent on Thursday, a day after the incident, wiping off some $1.46 billion from Nike's market capitalisation since Wednesday's close.  Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel said in a note that he was optimistic "any lasting damage to the company and its shares will prove minimal."  Williamson was wearing the Nike PG 2.5 basketball shoe when he was injured, Nike confirmed to Reuters in an email. The line of sneakers, launched in summer of 2018, sells for $95-$105 on Nike's website.  The shoe received mixed reviews and a rating of 4 out of 5 stars on Nike.com as of Thursday.  Nike is Duke's exclusive supplier of uniforms, shoes and apparel under a 12-year contract that was extended in 2015 and has had an exclusive deal with the private university since 1992, ESPN reported.  Nike's latest quarterly results showed signs of a rebound as it speeds up new product launches and expands partnerships with online retailers. The Beaverton, Oregon-based company has forecast sales growth for 2019 approaching low double-digits.  Williamson, who averaged 21.6 points a game, has been tipped as the "next Lebron James" and is expected to be selected first in the NBA Draft this June.  Krzyzewski said it was unclear how long Williamson would be out because of the injury.  Former President Barack Obama, director Spike Lee and star NFL running back Todd Gurley attended Wednesday's game at Cameron Indoor Stadium, the home court of the Blue Devils.  A video from the match posted on Twitter showed Obama sitting courtside, expressing shock and mouthing the words, "his shoe broke!"   “His shoe broke” — Complex Sports (@ComplexSports) February 21, 2019 Obama was shocked pic.twitter.com/tdwKtUJwtF The incident lit up social media, with celebrities and some of basketball's biggest stars expressing shock and dismay.  "Hope young fella is ok!" tweeted LeBron James (@KingJames) on Wednesday. "Literally blew thru his," he added, using a shoe emoji.   Hope young fella is ok! Literally blew thru his 👟. 🙏🏾 — LeBron James (@KingJames) February 21, 2019 "Again let's remember all the money that went into this game.... and these players get none of it," Donovan Mitchell (@spidadmitchell), a former first-round NBA draft pick and current guard for the Utah Jazz, tweeted on Wednesday. "And now Zion gets hurt... something has to change."   Again let’s remember all the money that went into this game. and these players get none of it.... and now Zion gets hurt... something has to change @NCAA — Donovan Mitchell (@spidadmitchell) February 21, 2019 Nike's social media sentiment dropped following the malfunction, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. With 1.6 billion impressions and a reach of 170 million users, people were twice as likely to express negative sentiment about the athletic apparel maker, Zoomph data showed.  This is not the first time Nike has faced controversy over the craftsmanship of its sportswear. In 2017, the company faced a backlash when several NBA jerseys worn by basketball stars, including James, ripped apart. Reuters<end_of_turn>

# This is the first year you can bet on the Oscars in the US ... and it likely won't be the last

While international bookmakers have long allowed Americans to bet on the Oscars, this is the first time they can legally place bets domestically.  The 91st annual Academy Awards are scheduled for Sunday night.  New Jersey is the only state allowing such bets, but the expansion away from traditional gambling — horse and dog racing and sports — signals an interest by gaming commissions to pursue a wider consumer base.  "New Jersey is taking advantage of the commercial opportunities," said Chad Millman, head of media for the sports betting analysis company Action Network. "They are new to the market and trying to expand their consumer base."  About a dozen sportbooks, including FanDuel and DraftKings, are offering wagers. Some are allowing bets on all categories up for awards while others are only doing the big six — best picture, best director, best actor, best actress, best supporting actor and best supporting actress.  "There's potential customers who might not be interested in sports, but who are interested in Hollywood," said Emily Bass, spokeswoman at FanDuel. "So, this is a perfect way for us to reach that demographic."  This year is very much a trial year for this kind of betting. Millman said other states will be paying close attention to how New Jersey's Oscar betting performs. If it is deemed successful, he said, other places in the U.S. could open up this betting pool next year.  However, don't expect to make a lot of money on your bets. Much of the reason that the Academy Awards has not been used in betting pools in the United States is the fact that there is a known outcome. While the winners are a closely guarded secret, there is the possibility that someone could figure out who they are.  "Nevada has never done the Oscars," said Jessica Welman, sports betting analyst for PlayUSA. "They don't touch the Oscars."  It's also the reason that the bets themselves are relatively low. Welman traveled to New Jersey to test out the different sportbooks, and when she tried to put $20 down on "Black Panther" for best picture, she was told the highest she could bet was $3.88. The payout, if she should win, would be around $107.  "Looks like everyone is keeping an eye on it and keeping it small," she said. "They aren't making it lucrative enough for anyone to throw things or cheat or collude."  In fact, the largest pot she could have won was about $860 on the editing category if "Bohemian Rhapsody" took home the trophy.  "No one is going to make a living doing this," Welman said.  For a while now, fans of the Oscars have done their own office pools, betting small sums just for fun, not to make a profit. Millman equates it to the prop bets that fans do during events like the Super Bowl. Prop bets are novelty side bets made on things that happen during an event rather than predict the outcome of the event.  For example, during the Super Bowl, hundreds of prop bets are available ranging from which team would be penalized first to the color of the Gaterade dumped on the winning coach.  The growth in popularity of these novelty bets hasn't just inspired traditional gambling companies, but for free-to-play apps and websites.  Tally is one such app. The prediction game was co-founded by Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and seeks to drive engagement with fans during live television events.  Tally started as a way for sports fans to predict the outcomes of NFL and NCAA football games without putting any money up front. Once that gained traction, the company began doing it for nonsporting events like the Golden Globes, the State of the Union and "The Bachelor" reality TV show.  For example, for the Golden Globes Tally did a traditional prediction spread for all the categories, but for "The Bachelor" it allowed fans to bet on the number of times girls would interrupt each other to speak with the bachelor and how many times it was mentioned during the premiere episode that bachelor Colton Underwood was a virgin.  For the State of the Union, Tally had prop bets on how many times President Donald Trump used the word "crisis" or said "make America great again."  Because Tally is free-to-play, it isn't considered gambling and therefore, the company can offer unique prop bets for events that other gambling institutions cannot, said Jason LeeKeenan, Tally co-founder and CEO.  For the Oscars, Tally will be doing a similar setup as the Golden Globes. Fans can make predictions for each of the awards for a chance at a $5,000 jackpot if they get them all correct.  LeeKeenan noted that the scoring does differ based on the number of other people that also made that prediction.The number of points are inversely related to how many people selected that prediction, he explained.  "You get more points for upsets," LeeKeenan said.  The person who gets the most points will receive $250. Second place gets $100 and that figure decreases all the way down to 10th place.  LeeKeenan said Tally's type of betting will likely expand beyond the Oscars and sports to other television events like the last season of "Game of Thrones" and other hotly anticipated premieres.  "Live events, that is the future of television," LeeKeenan said.  Disclosure: CNBC parent Comcast and NBC Sports are investors in FanDuel.<end_of_turn>

# U.S. Democrats introduce resolution stopping Trump border emergency

By Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will vote on Tuesday on a resolution aimed at stopping President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to build a wall on the border with Mexico, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday.  House Democrats introduced the resolution early on Friday, taking the first step to challenge Republican Trump's assertion that he could take money Congress had appropriated for other activities and use it to build the wall.  Recommended Slideshows PHOTOS: What's Brewing in Steamy Hallows, the Harry Potter-Inspired Cafe19 Pictures All of these celebrities have had their nudes leaked 36 Pictures Pelosi predicted the resolution would pass the Democratic-controlled House. Action would then move to the Republican-majority Senate, where the measure's future is less clear. About 226 House lawmakers have joined the sponsor, Democratic U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, in backing the legislation. The co-sponsors so far include one Republican, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, Castro said.  "What the president is attempting is an unconstitutional power grab," Castro said in a conference call with reporters. He called on all members of Congress — Democrats and Republicans — to support the resolution terminating Trump’s emergency declaration, saying it tramples on congressional authority and would set a dangerous precedent.  Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress decides how taxpayer dollars are spent. The president can, however, veto spending bills.  Trump declared the national emergency last week after Congress declined to fulfill his request for $5.7 billion this year to help build the wall.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer also plans to introduce such a resolution. The measure needs only a simple majority in both chambers. It will need the votes of at least four Republicans to pass the Senate, assuming all the Democrats and the two independents there back it.  If both chambers pass the resolution it would then go to Trump, who would likely veto it. Overriding the veto would require a two-thirds vote of support in both chambers.  Pelosi rejected Trump's argument that there is an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. "The president of the United States is declaring a national emergency to honor an applause line in a rally," she said.  "If the Congress rolls over on this, the president is likely to do it again," Castro said.  The issue is also in the courts. A coalition of 16 U.S. states led by California sued Trump and top members of his administration on Monday to block his decision to declare the emergency.  The lawsuit said Trump’s declaration was a misuse of presidential power.  Congress this month appropriated $1.37 billion for building border barriers following a long battle with Trump, which included a 35-day partial government shutdown - the longest in U.S. history - when agency funding lapsed on Dec. 22.

# Watch: O. J. Simpson spotted in Vail, posing for selfies

Watch: O. J. Simpson spotted in Vail, posing for selfies Former defendant in the Trial of the Century visits Colorado February 23, 2019 VAIL — O. J. Simpson, who was famously acquitted of the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman, but found guilty in a civil trial, was spotted in Vail yesterday. A handful of locals managed to snag pictures with Simpson in Lionshead Village. Simpson was also spotted at Bridge Street Bar, mingling with locals as the band played Scott Munn's edited version of Richie Valens' "La Bamba," called "Big F**king Bronco." The staff at Bart & Yeti's took a picture with the Heisman winner. The final photo that the Vail Daily has been able to obtain is a selfie captured with Simpson. Simpson, who won the Heisman Trophy at the University of Southern California, and is an inductee into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is most known for being the primary suspect in the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson. The trial took place over 134 days between 1994 and 1995. Simpson was found not guilty. In 2008, Simpson was found guilty of robbery of sports memorabilia from a Las Vegas hotel room and was sentenced to 33 years in prison. Simpson was released on parole in October of 2017.<end_of_turn>

"From 1st March I will begin hunger strike. I am going to fast till we get statehood. I am ready to face death," Kejriwal said in the assembly.  "Democracy has been implemented in the entire nation, but not Delhi. Public votes and selects a government, but the government has no power. So we're starting a movement on March 1 and I'll sit on indefinite fast for the full statehood of Delhi," Kejriwal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

# On “Empire,” Percussion Impresario Eli Keszler Finds His Own Natural Rhythm

Drummer Eli Keszler is as methodical in conversation as he is behind the kit. Discussing his music over Skype, the New York-based musician takes long pauses before answering questions, literally thinking out loud; he rolls his drumsticks around in his hands, tapping out rudimentary patterns on his kneecaps as he puts things together.  “I think that the greatest compliment I get is when people come to a concert and tell me that they forget that they were listening to a drummer,” he says, after a moment of contemplation.  Keszler isn’t any old four-on-the-floor player. His signature style of play involves combining dense flurries of gentle hits that come together to create nearly sustaining sounds, which he then mixes with minor use of electronics for harmonic effect. This ingenious adaptation, modeled off John Coltrane’s “sheets of sound” technique, recently helped Keszler top Boomkat’s 2018 Album of the Year list with his cityscape-inspired album Stadium, which reflected Keszler’s real-life move from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Not one to sit idly by, just off the heels of his last release, the drummer has returned with Empire, a three-track EP that delves into the shadows of the skyscrapers the musician previously glorified.  Keszler became obsessed with jazz in high school, listening to and absorbing everything he could find. He’d pick apart classic artists like Elvin Jones and Art Blakey, methodically breaking down the techniques they were using. This practice bled into his time as a student at the New England Conservatory of Music, and more significantly, his introduction to Coltrane’s aforementioned “sheets of sound.” The term, originally coined by legendary jazz critic Ira Gitler, refers to the saxophonist’s use of breakneck arpeggios—spanning both the lower and upper registers of the scale—to transcendent effect: a sea of instrumental squalls, assimilated into a vast ambient cloud.  “I began working with people like Phill Niblock and Tony Conrad and getting interested in drone music, but I felt like that was their language,” says Keszler. “I hear the individual hits, but I don’t hear my music as particularly fast. I actually hear it as quite slow and made up on lots of points. There’s a huge confusion between volume and power, and I think there’s another confusion between density and speed.”  After graduating from the Conservatory, Keszler honed his percussive craft in the studio, with a particular focus on weight, balance, and fluidity. His obsession to detail beget intense self-scrutiny—sometimes practicing for up to 10 hours at a time—and eventually, his distinct, analytical sound. Before long, he was one of experimental music’s most in-demand sidemen; recent years have seen him manning the kits for the likes of Laurel Halo, Rashad Becker, and Oneohtrix Point Never.  Keszler credits his collaborations with non-jazz artists not only with strengthening his skills as a player, but his overall sense of artistic purpose. “I grew up thinking I was going to be a jazz drummer, [but] then I realized the jazz circle was extremely conservative, closed off, and uninterested in a lot of the ideas that I was interested in,” he reflects. “At that point, I kind of vowed that I would never become a session drummer. However, it’s all on my own terms, and I’m bringing my own sound to it. It’s been really organic and rewarding. The last couple of years have given me some of the best musical experiences of my life.”  On Stadium, Keszler explored ideas relating to the urban landscape, the utopianism of cities, and what’s going to happen to them in the future. He’d walk around urban areas listening to his music, testing the mixes against towering buildings, blinding advertisements, and leaning into the inspiration he gains from the natural rhythms of the world. Conversely, Empire—a project that Keszler admits to being a possible turning point in his discography—dives into the dystopian layers of cities by utilizing foreboding ambient passages processed with Sensory Percussion software, and more industrial, full sounding percussion placed on top of noirish field recordings of city life.  “I see Empire as connected aesthetically to Stadium in a lot of ways,” says Keszler. “But I also see it as like a standalone EP, as a transitional project. I really wanted to create these utopian landscapes that felt devoid of people. I think there are moments in everybody’s life where you momentarily enter dystopia.”  “There’s a great [Jorge Luis] Borges story where he talks about the scariest dream he has ever had,” he adds. “He approaches his home and can’t remember which apartment he lives in, and he can’t find the key to it, but he surely lives there. It’s just a feeling of not knowing where to go. That’s the kind of space that I’m trying to evoke with this record.”  Empire, in its final form, proves just as haunting as Keszler intended: errant pieces that wander about and slowly unravel, like a person stranded in a massive city block system, desperately searching for a way out. On “The Tenth Part of a Featured World,” the final track on Empire, the artist gradually reverts to airy atmospheres of Stadium, beckoning us to follow him out of the maze and into whatever labyrinth he’ll construct next. The only rule is to go with the flow.<end_of_turn>

# Britain's first ever homeless police officer is also an army veteran

How DID this war hero police officer end up sleeping rough on the street?: Shocking story that shows why – one year on – the helpline we fought for is needed more than ever Britain's first homeless policeman, 46, is a former Iraq and Afghanistan veteran He decided to change careers after the Afghanistan War and joined the Met The unnamed man was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2017 He has received no support while on indefinite sick leave from the police force The important number...0800 323 4444. The helpline for Heroes number for troops to call at any time day or night Having risked his life for his country at home and abroad for two decades, he might be forgiven for expecting recognition for exemplary service. Tiring of Army life but determined to put his experience to good use, he then joined the Metropolitan Police, proving a brave and effective frontline officer. Yet instead of laurels, this dedicated public servant has, ten years on, achieved an altogether different distinction. He is Britain’s first homeless policeman. A Metropolitan Police officer, and veteran, has been sleeping rough in a Home Counties town Like so many who put their lives on the line to keep others safe, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2017. Emotionally adrift, his marriage failed – ‘I became impossible to live with’ – and then his life fell apart as his condition worsened. Shamefully, the state averted its eyes. On sick leave ever since, he remains in theory a serving officer because the Met appears – inexplicably – to have forgotten him, or rather, in the words of the voluntary group fighting his case, allowed him to ‘fall through the cracks’. Virtually penniless and unable to draw his pension, he slept rough last month, still with his warrant card in his back pocket. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, during which he repeatedly broke down, he spoke bitterly of abandonment, his belief that his Army and police careers had effectively been ‘for nothing’ and how his life had no horizons greater than finding his next hot meal. A 46-year-old proud father-of-three, he has asked not to be named. His story emerges on the anniversary of this newspaper’s successful campaign to ensure British troops suffering battlefield stress have a dedicated, round-the-clock helpline. Manned by specially trained professionals, the helpline has received a remarkable 1,700 calls from soldiers and their families over the past year. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ‘The Mail on Sunday highlighted a critically important and often hidden issue. I am incredibly proud of how much the helpline has achieved, helping serving personnel and their families access the best care, wherever they are.’ But one policeman’s plight is a reminder that more needs to be done. After exhausting the goodwill of friends, the officer slept in shop doorways in a Home Counties town. Even if passers-by gave the bearded man a second thought, they could never have guessed his occupation. Things have improved in the past fortnight. For now at least he has a roof over his head at a homeless hostel. A crack cocaine addict occupies the room next door, just the sort of person the officer frequently encountered when he patrolled the streets of East London attached to a violent crime unit. ‘It’s hard to think of the future when life is like this,’ he says. ‘It doesn’t feel like I have one.’ At his worst, his mind feels ‘like a washing machine’ mixing harrowing experiences from his military and police careers with one nightmarish memory segueing into another. Often, he awakes to find his face covered in blood from where he has clawed at the side of his head during the night. ‘In my sleep, I am struggling to remove my helmet. In Iraq, I always felt great relief – relief of pressure – taking off my helmet, goggles and radio at the end of an operation.’ After leaving school, he initially worked as a chef but he came from a military family and had always been fascinated by bomb disposal. After overcoming resistance from his mother, he joined the Engineers. Britain's first homeless policeman has been on indefinite sick leave from the force since 2017 (stock photo) It was a few years later, during the war in Kosovo in 1999, that the realities of his hazardous role first became shockingly apparent. In the face of Nato’s ground invasion, Serb forces retreated but, as they did so, systematically rounded up and executed every man they could find. Bodies were slung into mass graves, often laced with booby traps. ‘There were hidden devices primed to go off when a body was removed,’ says the officer. ‘It was nerve-jangling work. On one occasion, we were with Belgian gendarmes at the site of a mass grave in a village. After killing the men and burying them, the Serbs dug them back up and swapped their clothing to make identification difficult. I’ll never forget the grief and desperation of the women and children.’ Worse followed. The officer’s team collected body parts scattered by cluster bombs. ‘It was horrifying and it affects me now, but at the time we just got on with the job.’ The officer’s Army career coincided with the increasing use of improvised explosive devices in Iraq. By now a corporal stationed outside Basra, he led a four-man bomb disposal search team. ‘There was a road we called Sniper Alley and it was our job to sprint alongside armoured personnel carriers trying to spot IEDs. All the while, we had to be wary of snipers positioned in high-rise flats.’ He recalls another occasion around the same period when his airport base came under sustained mortar attack. ‘I was on my way to meet a colleague for a game of chess when I heard this familiar whistling sound. I dived face-down into a ditch and one must have landed close because I was encased in dirt. I lay there for 40 minutes before it was safe to move.’ On leave a few months later, he recalls being in a pub garden near his then home in Essex one summer evening with his wife and friends when, overhead, a plane approached Stansted. The unnamed former veteran was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2017 (stock photo) ‘It made the same whistling sound as the mortar and I instinctively dived under the table, sending glasses scattering.’ After a difficult tour of Afghanistan, he began to think of a career change. He passed through police training with flying colours and relished his new work – though it was not without danger. During the London riots in 2011, he found himself cornered by a mob, punched to the ground and battered with an iron bar. Ironically it was an off-duty accident in which he fractured an eye socket which led to his breakdown. Off work for months, he ruminated on his past and grew first reclusive then increasingly paranoid. During the London riots in 2011, he found himself cornered by a mob, punched to the ground and battered with an iron bar By spring 2017, he was, he says, ‘completely broken’. The Met talked of counselling sessions but the officer says that a former Army colleague recommended Combat Stress, which offers mental health support for veterans. Such was the severity of his condition, the charity sent him on a six-week residential therapy course. But he claims that afterwards the Met wanted him back at work. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson launched the helpline for heroes after a campaign by The Mail on Sunday What it should have done, he says, was to help him get better. Instead, he was signed off sick and after a year his payments had dwindled to nothing. And when last month his wife finally evicted him, he found himself homeless. Another group, PTSD Blues – which helps police officers – is now fighting his corner. Co-founder Paul Settle says: ‘We always try to get officers back to work. Sadly, this man’s condition is now too far advanced. He should have been retired on ill-health many months ago. Of more than 200 PTSD cases I’ve dealt with since we started in 2017, his is the most high-risk and critical. It’s the only one I’ve felt the need to directly contact the Met Police Commissioner about.’ The Met said it could not comment on individual cases, but was ‘committed to providing a range of support for officers suffering from psychological-related illness’. It added: ‘All cases involving current employees continue to remain under review and the Met endeavours to ensure that any necessary support is provided.’ The important number...0800 323 4444.

# Aberdeen FC praised for proving social benefits of the game - Evening Express

Aberdeen Football Club has been hailed as the best in Scotland for showcasing the social benefits of the game by a leading sports figure.  A report commissioned by Uefa says participation in the country’s favourite sport at a grassroots level adds £1.25 billion to Scotland’s coffers, including a £110.4 million boost to Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.  Politicians and senior football figures were among the figures who attended a networking event at Pittodrie yesterday to discuss the study’s findings.  Speaking at the event, Joe FitzPatrick, Minister for Public Health, Sport and Wellbeing, said AFC was invited to act as a case study for the report because of its “excellent reputation”.  He added: “While the national picture is important, I know the regional dimension – covering Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, in this case – brings the fantastic work being undertaken by football into focus and puts a figure on the economic benefits our national game delivers.”  The study found 71,000 people across the north-east participate in football, contributing £110.4m.  This amounts to a direct impact of £18.9m to the region’s economy, £14.6m in social benefits, with volunteers saving £13m of this and £76.9m in healthcare savings. This includes saving the NHS £4.5m in mental health provision and savings of £1.17m on preventing around 240 cases of type 2 diabetes.  Ian Maxwell, chief executive of the SFA, said up until this point the social benefits of football have just been “anecdotal”, but said the results of the new study have been “simply staggering”.  He added: “Aberdeen is a very good example, probably our strongest example.  “It’s important that the Aberdeen model is looked at as one that can be rolled out across the country.”  Andy Gould, head of football development at the Scottish FA, added “fantastic things” have been achieved at AFC, particularly due to the people in the area who are “passionate” about using the sport to make a difference.  He said: “The guys at the community trust, the guys at the club, the Scottish FA and the clubs around this area are really living and breathing exactly what we want to see.  “It’s not a football club that is only interested about getting people to come here on a Saturday. It’s a football club that wants to go out and reach and touch and support as many people as they possibly can.  “The examples of this club can only be a good thing for others to follow and to use that model as a way forward.  “That’s why we’re here because this club in particular do it so well and we’re proud to work with the guys very closely on that.  “The club here has a huge skill set and we need to transfer that knowledge so that each of those other clubs in this area can all take a step up and the connections they have to other clubs can take a step up too.  “The whole game improves, so it’s not about one club improving and not worrying about the rest.”  The Aberdeen FC Community Trust (AFCCT), the club’s community organisation, deals with more than 200,000 people per year through 60 different projects.  A dementia-friendly programme, which earned recognition from the European Club Association, and a school of football at Northfield Academy are among the projects the trust is involved in organising.<end_of_turn>

# Keys to the Game: Bulls at Magic (02.22.19) | Chicago Bulls

Keys to the Game: Bulls at Magic (02.22.19)  Tonight the Chicago Bulls (14-44) visit Central Florida to take on the Orlando Magic (27-32) for the fourth and final time this season. The Magic have won two of the first three meetings, the last of which took place on Chicago’s West Side on January 2nd. That night Orlando snapped a six-game losing streak in blowing out the Bulls, 112-84. Forward Aaron Gordon powered the Magic with 18 points, seven rebounds and nine assists, while Antonio Blakeney and Shaquille Harrison each posted 11 off the bench to lead Chicago.  Orlando hits the home hardwood this evening hoping the just concluded NBA All-Star hiatus hasn’t killed or slowed the momentum they had built with a five game winning streak heading into the break. The last time they played the Magic thumped Charlotte, 127-89, behind reserve forward Terrence Ross’ 21 points off the bench. Starting center and recent All-Star Nikola Vucevic also notched his fifth straight double-double with 17 points and 11 rebounds, while Gordon chipped in 10 points and 10 rebounds. Vucevic is enjoying the best season of his eight-year career, averaging 20.5 points and 12.1 rebounds. So far he’s led the Magic in scoring 26 times, rebounding a team-high 47 times and in assists on 12 occasions. He’s also posted a team-best 41 double-doubles, which currently ranks fourth in the league.  Like the Magic, the Bulls are also coming off an impressive win the last time they played, defeating Memphis at the United Center, 122-110. As a team, the Bulls shot 56.3 percent from the field overall, including going 8-of-20 from behind the 3-point arc (40 percent), and dominated the glass, outrebounding the Grizzlies 47-31. Newly acquired forward Otto Porter Jr. shot a scorching 16-of-20 from the field, including 3-of-5 from deep, to lead Chicago with 37 points.  In four games with the Bulls, Porter Jr. is hitting a ridiculous 62.1 percent of his shots overall while averaging 22.5 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.3 assists in almost 35 minutes.  Another key Chicago player of late has been second-year forward Lauri Markkanen. The seven-foot Finn has posted 20+ points and snared 10+ rebounds in five-consecutive games. It’s the first time in his career he’s notched five straight double-doubles, and if he can put 20 or more points on the board again tonight it’ll be the seventh straight time he would have accomplished such a feat. Over his last five games Markkanen is contributing 24.4 points, 13.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists, while shooting 14-of-35 (40.0%) from behind the arc, and 42-of-89 (47.2%) overall.  Zach LaVine has also been playing the best ball of his career recently. The 6’5 guard has been torching the twine to the tune of 24.4 points, shooting 9-of-22 (40.9%) from deep, 45-of-84 (53.6%) overall, as well as 23-of-29 (79.3%) from the charity stripe while dishing 6.4 assists over his last five outings.  Although Chicago’s won-loss record isn’t anything to brag about, the truth is the Bulls’ offense has begun the really click recently. For example, Chicago averaged just 95.6 points per game in December, with a rather paltry offensive rating of 97.0. In January, they averaged 104.0 points per game, with a mediocre offensive rating of 102.7. But in six February contests, the Bulls are putting up 118.2 points with an impressive offensive rating of 115.9.  In order for Chicago to come out on top tonight they’re going to have to focus on out hustling Orlando at both ends of the floor.  Offensively the Bulls need to keep the ball moving from player-to-player to get everyone involved in the action. The ball must also skip from side-to-side to force the Magic’s defense to scramble and burn energy. To that end Chicago’s primary playmakers (Kris Dunn, LaVine, Markkanen as well as Porter Jr.) have to hit the floor with the same aggressive mindset and attack the rim at every opportunity.  Defensively as a team, Chicago will need to keep Vucevic in check, especially on the glass, forcing him out of his comfort zone as much as possible. If the Bulls can hold their own or possibly even assume command of the defensive boards, they should be able to exploit their overall athleticism by consistently grabbing control of the ball and running down the floor to post quick and easy scores before Orlando has time to set up.  Starting point guard, Kris Dunn, missed the Memphis game last week after taking a hard fall a couple of nights earlier against Milwaukee. The third-year playmaker practiced Wednesday and yesterday and should be good to go tonight. Dunn’s blue collar, hardnosed mentality will no doubt be a welcome addition to Chicago’s attack.<end_of_turn>

# Washington Post: White House plans to assemble group of scientists to re-evaluate climate science conclusions

The White House is planning to assemble an “ad hoc group” of scientists to re-evaluate the federal government’s current conclusions about climate science and the negative impact of fossil fuels, The Washington Post reported Sunday.  The Post, citing conversations with multiple unnamed administration officials, said that the group “would include scientists who question the severity of climate impacts and the extent to which humans contribute to the problem.”  The group would include researchers from within the government, the paper said. The “ad hoc group” would differ from a formal advisory committee because it would not be required to abide by the same amount of public disclosure.  According to the paper, the plan, which is not finalized, was discussed at a meeting Friday with several high level administration officials in which attendees “debated how best to establish a group of researchers that could scrutinize recent federal climate reports.”  The paper said the proposed panel “will not be tasked with scrutinizing recent intelligence community assessments of climate change.”  The Post also noted that the group is a revised version of another group that the White House was recently mulling.  Last week, the paper reported that the administration was considering creating a committee tasked with studying whether climate change poses a national security threat.  Citing planning documents related to the committee, the Post said that it would have been led by William Happer, a National Security Council official and climate change skeptic who once compared the “demonization” of carbon dioxide to the treatment of Jews under Adolf Hitler.  This week, several hearings on climate change will take place before congressional committees, including one before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Science with Neil Jacobs, an assistant secretary at the Department of Commerce and Michael Freilich, a NASA official.<end_of_turn>

# 5 must-know moments from the Oscars

They might not have been the hosts of the 2019 Oscars, but Tina Fey, Maya Rudolph and Amy Poehler kicked off the night with a shoutout to USA TODAY! Courtesy A.M.P.A.S.© 2019 And that concludes one of the most unpredictable Academy Awards in ages. Controversial race drama “Green Book” unseated presumed front-runner “Roma” for best picture, although Alfonso Cuaron’s Netflix masterpiece still walked away with three Oscars (bested only by Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody” with four). “The Favourite” star Olivia Colman surprised in best actress over seven-time nominee Glenn Close (“The Wife”), while Javier Bardem, Alfonso Cuaron and Spike Lee all made bold political statements about President Donald Trump’s administration during their time on stage. Some of the other major moments that you need to know about from the unusually sleepy telecast: Amy Poehler, Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph make us wish they were hosts Following months of speculation as to whether this year's controversial ex-Oscar host Kevin Hart would be replaced, the show went on with no emcee – although surely the Academy wished it had with presenters Poehler, Fey and Rudolph. The former "Saturday Night Live" trio had the audience in stitches as they presented best supporting actress to an emotional Regina King: telling intentionally cheesy jokes about many of the nominees, and even prodding this very newspaper. “Good evening and welcome to the one-millionth Academy Awards," Fey said. "We are not your hosts, but we’ll stand here a little too long so the people who get USA TODAY tomorrow will think that we hosted." Regina King thanks mom in teary, ovation-worthy speech This year's Oscars did not disappoint when it came to off-the-cuff speeches, from Spike Lee literally jumping for joy when he claimed best adapted screenplay for "Blackkklansman" to Olivia Colman hilariously accepting best actress for "The Favourite," which she dedicated to fellow nominee (and expected winner) Glenn Close. (“You’ve been my idol for so long – this is not how I wanted it to be," Colman endearingly apologized.) But the best speech of the night came from "If Beale Street Could Talk" winner Regina King, who earned a rousing standing ovation as she accepted best supporting actress, which she dedicated to her own mom, who was shown crying in the audience. "It's appropriate for me to be standing here, 'cause I'm an example of what it looks like when support and love is poured into someone. Mom, I love you much," King said through tears. "Thank you for teaching me that God is leaning in my direction." Trevor Noah calls out Mel Gibson with racially charged joke Introducing "Black Panther," "Daily Show" host Trevor Noah (who had a small voiceover role in the superhero juggernaut) took a jab at actor/director Mel Gibson, who was accused of using racial slurs during an argument with an ex-girlfriend in 2010. " 'Black Panther’ may be an African hero, but his story and his appeal are universal. I know this personally because of all the people that constantly come up to me and say, ‘Wakanda Forever!' " Noah said, referencing the film's famous catchphrase. "Mel Gibson came up to me like, ‘Wakanda Forever.’ He said another word after that but the Wakanda part was nice.” Tyler Perry calls out Academy for planning to skip awards The Oscars were (mostly) spared of any major lambasting Sunday night – surprising, given how many high-profile stars called out the Academy in the weeks leading up to the ceremony for proposed changes to the show, which included cutting categories such as cinematography and editing from the telecast. But filmmaker Tyler Perry got in a dig as he presented best cinematography to "Roma," saying how "each person, each craft, each discipline is essential. ... It is a true honor for me to present this next award live on camera, not during the commercial break – thank you, Academy." Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper get intimate during steamy "Shallow" performance Is anyone else blushing right now? Twitter was ablaze with romance speculation after newly minted Oscar winner Lady Gaga performed her "A Star is Born" hit "Shallow" with Cooper, their first since an impromptu rendition of the song during her Las Vegas show last month. Sparks seemingly flew between the co-stars during the intimate rendition, as a tuxedo-clad Cooper sat down with Gaga at the piano and they gazed into each others' eyes, faces nearly touching. "I refuse to accept any truth other than that Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper are deeply in love," one Twitter user wrote after. Many others speculated they were about to kiss. (Although, Cooper attended the show with his model girlfriend Irina Shayk, and Gaga just announced her split from ex-fiance Christian Carino last week.)<end_of_turn>

# 2019 Oscar Winners: See The Full List

The time has finally come to put an end to this year's arduous, and frustratingly unpredictable, awards season with tonight's 2019 Academy Awards. And while we still have no idea which film will win the night's most coveted Oscar — will it be Alfonso Cuarón's intimate cinematic achievement Roma, the crowd-pleasing favorite Bohemian Rhapsody, or the critically acclaimed Marvel blockbuster Black Panther? — that makes the night all the more exciting. Or tedious, depending on how you look at it.  Roma leads this year's Oscar nominations with 10 nods and is the favorite to win Best Picture, which would be a huge moment for Netflix. (Not only is this the streaming service's first nomination for Best Picture, but if Roma wins, it would be the first-ever foreign film to take home the top prize.) But don't count out Ryan Coogler's Black Panther; the cast won the ensemble award at this year's Screen Actors Guild Awards, proving that there's a lot of support for the Marvel film among the cast's Hollywood peers. Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book — this awards season's two most controversial films — also have a shot at walking away with the night's highest honor.  As for Bradley Cooper's directorial debut A Star Is Born, Best Original Song is Lady Gaga's to lose at this point, and while Glenn Close is the odds-on favorite to win Best Actress, don't sleep on Gaga — or The Favourite's Olivia Colman. And when it comes to Best Actor, well, Rami Malek better have a speech — and one hell of a Freddie Mercury quote — prepared.  Then again, this awards season has taken so many twists and turns, anything can (and probably will) happen. Here are the night's big winners, which we'll be updating throughout the show.

# Manchester United dealt double injury blow just 25 minutes in vs Liverpool | CaughtOffside

Manchester United have been dealt a huge double injury blow early on against Liverpool, with both Ander Herrera and Juan Mata having to go off injured. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been forced into action, bringing on Andreas Pereira in midfield for Herrera, while he’s summoned Jesse Lingard off the bench to fill in for Mata. MORE: (Picture) Manchester United and Liverpool stars mixed up in embarrassing pre-game blunder from broadcaster Marcus Rashford has managed to stay on but also looked to be hobbling at points in this frenetic first half, which is bringing some committed challenges, even if the football hasn’t been that great so far. United will be eager to win this game against Liverpool, who are in with their best chance of winning the Premier League title for a long time. However, the Red Devils are in fine form going into this game so will be hoping to derail their rivals’ title challenge. Losing Herrera and Mata won’t make that any easier, however, with Solskjaer already using up two of his subs just over half way through the first half. Still, Pereira and Lingard are certainly not bad options to have for United as reserves.<end_of_turn>

# 'Partying' man found passed out in Utah hotel with stolen gun, police say

SALT LAKE CITY — A man who told police he had been partying was arrested early Sunday after he was found passed out in the hallway of a downtown Salt Lake hotel with a stolen handgun in his waistband.  Jeffrey Eugene Beasley, 35, was booked into the Salt Lake County Jail for investigation of possession of a firearm by a restricted person, theft by receiving stolen property, two counts of drug possession and intoxication.  Sunday about 6:30 a.m., security at the Radisson Hotel, 215 W. South Temple, found Beasley passed out and lying face down in the hallway on the ninth floor, according to a jail booking report. Security guards noticed a handgun was tucked in the back of Beasley's pants so they called Salt Lake City police. Comment on this story Officers learned the gun was reported stolen out of Murray, the report states. Beasley was also found to have heroin and 15 Clonazepam pills, according to the report.  "Beasley was in a partially conscious state and at times he could not tell me where he was. He indicated that he had been partying the evening prior," the officer noted in his report.  It was not immediately known if Beasley was a registered guest at the hotel.  In 2013, he was sentenced to one to 15 years at the Utah State Prison for a conviction of felony drug possession, according to court records.  Court records show Beasley has a lengthy history of drug-related arrests and convictions.<end_of_turn>

# Pregnant tigress found dead in Bhadra Reserve

CHIKKAMAGALURU: An eight-year-old pregnant tigress with two fetuses in her womb has been found dead in Bhadra Tiger Reserve in Chikkamagaluru district. The cause of the death is yet to be ascertained, but forest officials suspect that the big cat may have died due to miscarriage, which could have been caused due to territorial fight, or after eating carcasses poisoned by humans.  The carcass of the tigress was found at Hebbe wildlife range near Tegur Gudda in the tiger reserve of the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary on Friday. However, Assistant Conservator of Forests Chengappa told The New Indian Express that it might have died on Wednesday.  “We conducted an autopsy on the carcass on Saturday and sent the samples to a laboratory to establish the cause of the death. Our prime suspicion is that the tigress might have died due to territorial fighting with another tiger. There are wounds on the carcass. It could have also died due to death of the fetuses in the womb. The fetuses could have died when the tigress was fighting with another tiger,” he said. 
Chengappa said while it is unlikely that the tigress could have died due to poisoning by humans, the investigation is also looking on that angle too. “We are waiting for the lab report,” he added. Wildlife conservation activist Veeresh G, who was present during the autopsy, said poisoning of the tigress could be a possibility as there were previous such cases. “When tigers come close to villages, the people poison the killed prey, which are more likely be cows. When the tigers consume the poisoned cow, they die. Two tigers had died due to poisoning of prey carcasses at Umblebailu near Shivamogga about three years ago,” he said.  Veeresh also said flesh and ear tag of a cow was found during the autopsy, which was done as per the standard operating procedure prescribed by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. “The tigress could have also died due to pregnancy toximonia,” he suspected. The carcass was burnt in the forest.<end_of_turn>

# Class 5A hoops: Down 18, top-seeded Johnston rallies to survive massive scare, edge Urbandale

The Dragons used defensive intensity and level heads to spoil the J-Hawks' upset bid in the state quarterfinals in Des Moines. Danny Lawhon, dlawhon@dmreg.com Class 5A's top seed probably wasn't as worried as it should have been late Monday morning. Johnston came out for the second half of its state quarterfinal game at Wells Fargo Arena down 18 to an eighth-seeded Urbandale squad the Dragons had beaten twice this winter by a combined 45 points. There was no panic, however, either in the locker room or on the floor. There was no change in warmup attitude, and the execution was more of what the 21-2 Dragons were used to. Speed, defense, dominance. An overwhelming second-half display, paced by Maya McDemott's game-high 22 points, helped the No. 1 seed survive the unexpected test and edge the J-Hawks 66-57 in the latest charged chapter of the suburban Des Moines rivalry and in Urbandale's first state appearance in a quarter-century. Behind 41-23 at intermission, thanks to Urbandale's 59 percent shooting and 6-for-11 effort from 3-point range, Johnston methodically upped the intensity as the second half progressed. A Kendall Nead (15 points) triple made the first real dent at 44-30 with 6 minutes to go in the third quarter, when the Dragons began to use a full-court press. A Regan Nesheim (14 points) steal and drive led to an old-fashioned 3-point play and just a 50-46 deficit with the same amount of time remaining in the fourth. Off a Macy Thompson offensive rebound 90 seconds later, McDermott completed the comeback. Johnston's first lead all day came at 53-52 on a 3 from the wing that sent the Dragons' bench spilling onto the floor after a timeout and the packed Johnston student section tumbling into the rows behind them in delirium. "We just said we had to persevere through adversity," McDermott said of her team's halftime pump-up speech. "(Urbandale) came out stronger than ever. They’re a good team. We had to come out and trust each other and trust the process." The J-Hawks (13-10) crept back within a point on the lone 3-pointer from Urbandale senior guard DeeDee Pryor, who paced her team with 16 points. But Johnston sealed the game with clutch plays down low and a 24-for-32 clip from the foul line to advance to Thursday's 10 a.m. semifinal against West Des Moines Valley. By the final seconds, Dragons coach Chad Jilek was wearing a much different-looking smile than the wry one he sported in the second quarter. "I thought, 'It wasn't going to matter what we were doing. They were going to hit almost every shot,'" Jilek said. "... But I'm one of the luckiest guys in the state. There are coaches out there who are so much better than me. I just have players. Players go out and execute and win. "The girls just took over in the second half. We just needed to get them to focus harder, and keep attacking, and they did." Urbandale wasn't hanging its collective head despite the disappointment. The girls made the school's first appearance in the state tournament since 1994 a memorable one, and even received a visit from members of that year's team to serve as motivation. "It was nice to end the drought, because now it puts Urbandale on the map," Pryor said. "Hopefully, future teams and programs will be worried about us." The 6-for-9 shooting effort from 6-foot-1 freshman Jada Gyamfi (12 points) is just one reason coach Kenton Tennal was upbeat about his team's future. "It’s hard to hold back a giant like that for that long," Tennal said. "They’re kind of where we want to be. We want to be out here every single year, and I think the girls started something pretty special this year." The Dragons are the ones hoping to finish this season with their first five-player state championship, just like they (eventually) did Monday. BOX SCORE Urbandale 22 19 9 7 — 57 Johnston 14 9 20 23 — 66 Urbandale (13-10) — Pryor 16, J. Gyamfi 12, M. Gyamfi 8, Putz 8, Cole 7, Lynch 3, Heller 3. Also played: Herzberg, Gaskil, Koua.

# Court approves order to stop PFAS from entering Cape Fear River

WILMINGTON, NC (WECT) - A judge has approved a consent order requiring Chemours to do more to protect drinking water for residents in southeastern North Carolina.  The revised consent order between Chemours and the NC Department of Environmental Quality was made public last week. The updated agreement requires Chemours to report monthly GenX air emissions, analyze per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) buildup in river sediment and provide filtration systems for certain drinking water fountains and maintain them for 20 years.  "Today’s ruling means real relief for people who have wondered for too long when the pollution in their water would be properly addressed by Chemours," DEQ Secretary Michael Regan said in a news release. "This ruling provides a clear timeline and certainty for the people of the Cape Fear River Basin. It sets a strong precedent: profits may not come before people, and the leadership of the state of North Carolina will not allow your actions to go unchecked."  Superior Court Judge Douglas Sasser approved the order in its entirety, meaning reductions in PFAS/GenX downstream will continue, according to the release.  Cape Fear River Watch partnered with DEQ to file the revised consent order against Chemours, which has admitted releasing GenX into the Cape Fear River at its Fayetteville Works plant.  The Cape Fear Public Utility Authority said last week it is reconsidering its motion against Chemours after the filing of the revised consent order, saying it includes “some substantial steps toward addressing the concerns of downstream water users” and forces “a number of additional measures on Chemours that were missing from the original proposal.”  All terms of the order went into effect Monday and DEQ said it will implement terms of the order with the weight of the court’s contempt power to hold Chemours accountable.<end_of_turn>

# Adani highest bidder for five airports, including Ahmedabad, Jaipur & Lucknow - Times of India

Adani highest bidder for five airports, including Ahmedabad, Jaipur & Lucknow Adani highest bidder for five airports, including Ahmedabad, Jaipur & Lucknow Saurabh Sinha | TNN | Updated: Feb 25, 2019, 15:11 IST Highlights In all, AAI has got 32 bids for the six airports from 10 bidders. Adani’s foray into airport will now mean India has more private sector biggies in the field which so far was dominated by the GMR (Delhi and Hyderabad) and GVK (Mumbai and till some years back Bangalore). NEW DELHI: The Adani Group has emerged as the highest bidder for five of the six airports government plans to run public-private way like the mega hubs at Delhi and Mumbai. The Gautam Adani-led infra major has won the bids to operate Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mangalore, Trivandrum and Lucknow airports for next 50 years, say Airports Authority of India (AAI) sources. The financial bids for the sixth airport, Guwahati, will be opened on Tuesday.

 
 “The tendering process is complete. Now the actual award of work and transfer of the airports to the highest bidder will happen after Cabinet clearance,” said a senior AAI official. The financial bids for all the six airports were to be opened on Monday. “However, there was a judicial order against opening of Guwahati airport which has now been lifted. The bids for that airport will open on Tuesday,” said the official. 
 The GMR and Adani Groups had bid for all the six airports. According to the request for proposal issued for these airports last December, the letter of award has to be issued to the winning bidder on February 28. 
 This is the second big round of privatising airports after Delhi and Mumbai were handed out to private players, GMR and GVK, over a decade back. AAI has now opted for a new model of revenue generation from these six airports’ prospective bidders. “The concessionaire shall pay to the Authority, on a monthly-basis, a fee (the ‘per-passenger fee’ or PPF) in respect of each passenger (both domestic and international) handled at the airport in accordance with the concession agreement,” the RFP document says. 
 Adanis PPF was the highest at the five airports whose financial bids were opened on Monday. For Ahmedabad, the PPF quoted by Adani and GMR is learnt to be Rs 177 and Rs 85, respectively. Similarly, the bid by Adani and GMR for Jaipur was Rs 174 and Rs 69; for Mangalore Rs 115 and Rs 18; for Trivandrum Rs 168 and Rs 63 and for Lucknow it was Rs 171 and Rs 63. 
 Jaipur and Ahmedabad airports had got seven bids each; Lucknow and Guwahati six each and Mangalore and Thiruvananthapuram three each. In all, AAI has got 32 bids for the six airports from 10 bidders. 
 The PPF bid amounts show how aggressively the Adani Group bid for the airports. Adani’s foray into airport will now mean India has more private sector biggies in the field which so far was dominated by the GMR (Delhi and Hyderabad) and GVK (Mumbai and till some years back Bangalore). 
 Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, director and practice lead (transport and logistics) at CRISIL Infrastructure Advisory, said: “Hitherto airports sector in India was predominantly dominated by couple of players, an entry of a private player with deep pockets to manage these operational assets (Five of the six assets for which results have been declared) augurs well for the sector and in the days ahead we should see good competition amongst the players. We expect AAI to get a revenue in the region of Rs 525-575 crore in the first year and future revenue would be linked to the traffic growth.” 
 AAI’s RFP said “the winning concessionaire shall be responsible for operations and management of the existing airport assets as well as for designing, engineering, financing, construction and development of the further/ additional air-side, terminal, city-side and land-side infrastructure for the airport and the operation and management thereof in accordance with the concession agreement and applicable laws.” 
 The Adani’s current aviation presence is limited to having an airline license for Karnavati Aviation and owning an airstrip in Mundra, Gujarat.

# Cowboys DT David Irving speaks out on Instagram: 'I'm not in the NFL because I'm an Eagle Scout...'

Cowboys DT David Irving speaks out on Instagram: 'I'm not in the NFL because I'm an Eagle Scout...'  David Irving had something to say Monday night.  The Cowboys defensive tackle took to Instagram, letting his followers know that he's in the NFL due to his natural, God-given abilities -- and not because he's an Eagle Scout. Warning: The comment section of the Instagram post below contains language that may not be suitable for some readers. "I'm in the NFl [sic] because I'm great at what I do," Irving wrote. "I'm not in the NFL because I'm an Eagle Scout , or the perfect model citizen. I didn't put on a mask or kiss a** to be where I am. Im here on natural ability . This is God's plan. Not mine. Trust me , I'm adjusting to it as well. Once I step on the field and stop performing , THEN we have a problem .. . So does anyone have anything to say about my play ?" This isn't the first time Irving has spoken his mind on the popular social media platform. Some Cowboys fans probably remember his Insta-rant on drug use and the NFL's drug policy. Irving played in just two games last season. He was on the field for 56 snaps, recording one sack and two quarterback pressures. His last appearance came in a game against Washington on Oct. 21. A high-ankle sprain hindered Irving in the final two months of the season. He was not as aggressive with his rehab as club officials wanted and only sporadically appeared at The Star in the closing weeks of the season after receiving a second opinion.  Irving, for the second consecutive year, was suspended to open the 2018 season for a violation of the NFL's drug policy. Once he was reinstated, he missed practices due to a custody battle involving his daughter and for mandated counseling sessions as it relates to his after-care program. Irving becomes a free agent in March. Per SportsDay's David Moore, the Cowboys have no intention of keeping him.<end_of_turn>

# 4 cops among 9 gang members arrested in Guerrero

Federal and state officials in Chilapa, Guerrero, arrested nine members of the violent criminal gang Los Rojos on Saturday and four of them turned out to be officers in the municipal police department.  Two of those arrested were minors, and all were allegedly involved in drug trafficking activities with the gang, which has been embroiled in a violent turf war with the Los Ardillos gang since 2011.  At the time of their arrest, the gang members were found in possession of seven firearms, ammunition, four cell phones, packages and bags containing marijuana and 62 small bags of cocaine. The authorities also seized the police officers’ patrol truck.  According to state authorities, the Los Rojos gang is led by Zenén “El Chaparro” Nava Sánchez.  Last year, nine municipal police officers were murdered in Chilapa, including chief Isidro Casarrubias Tlaltempa, whose corpse was found dismembered in Chilpancingo several days after he was kidnapped.  Casarrubias was questioned by his captors on video, in which he declared that Chilapa Mayor Jesús Parra García had ordered his municipal police force to protect a local criminal gang.

# Turkey's Erdogan to meet White House adviser Kushner in Ankara

2019/02/26 | 19:30 
 
(Hatha al-Youm | Iraq News)- White House adviser Jared Kushner is expected to meet with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday, broadcaster CNN Turk said on Tuesday. Kushner has responsibility for Washington's Israel-Palestinian policy. He has said he will address final-status issues of that conflict, including establishing borders, during a week-long trip to the Middle East. Turkey and Israel, former allies, expelled each other's top diplomats last May during a row over clashes in which dozens of Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces on the Gaza border. Turkey has been one of the most vocal critics of the US move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and opening an embassy there.

# Legendary high school coach set to call it a career. He’s two wins from exiting with a state title

The Southeast High girls basketball team was fresh off coach John Harder’s sixth Final Four appearance when A’moni Waiters and Daija Snipes were freshmen.  At the conclusion of the 2015-16 season, Harder took his pair of future stars to the Final Four so they’d get a first-hand look at what they’d be working for. What they weren’t expecting was a flat tire on the way home from Lakeland.  That day — minus the flat tire — proved to be a life changer for Waiters and Snipes and a springboard for one final title for Harder.  It was also the day that Harder told them they’d get there again by the time they were seniors. They’ll get that chance when they face Jacksonville Bishop Kenny (28-2) in Wednesday’s Class 6A state semifinals at the RP Funding Center in Lakeland. The game is scheduled to start at 6 p.m.  Sign Up and Save  Get six months of free digital access to the Bradenton Herald  #ReadLocal  “We were sitting there scared to death on the side of I-4,” Harder said. “I didn’t know how to change a tire and had to call a state trooper to change it. I’m glad the principal gave us the day off to go and they’ve been wanting to go back ever since.”  “They’re actually going and it’s like we planned this,” he continued. “It’s like a dream that was supposed to happen.”  Harder wasn’t dreaming when he first saw Waiters, a center, and Snipes first come to the program. Waiters is the tallest player Harder has had since Trina Altman patrolled the paint nearly two decades ago and Snipes has been Southeast’s vocal leader for four years.  The Seminoles (26-4) finished as district runner-up for two years. Southeast has reeled off 15 straight wins since losing to 64-62 to Sarasota Booker in January. That streak includes four wins over St. Petersburg Lakewood, a team that returned three strong starters.  “They made a commitment that losing wasn’t going to happen again,” Harder said. “You could see that every game was better. That Booker loss catapulted us to the regional championship.”  Snipes said the work toward the Final Four began over the summer and into the fall.  “We’re a different team than we were at the beginning of the year and we’re a lot better,” she said. “We’ve got a lot of chemistry and heart and we always talked about what we had to do to get here.”  History could also be on Harder’s side as he makes his last appearance in the state finals. Back in that first season, Southeast beat St. Petersburg Gibbs 37-36 before going on to win Harder’s first state title. That was the same score as Southeast’s win over Booker in last week’s Class 6A-Region 3 final — a game that Harder said ended in similar fashion.  “All these years have passed, and here I stand with the same score and the same kind of energy,” Harder said. “I’m not tired at all even though I haven’t slept much. I’ll make it through this week and anything after that is icing on the cake.”  Harder’s emotional reaction to winning the regional title in the final game he’d ever coach on the court bearing his name at Southeast High was something his players took to heart. They’d love to let him experience that joy one last time.  “We know what happened for him in his first year, so for us to make this happen for his last year is the best feeling ever for us,” Waiters said. “When he walks in the locker room there’s so much joy on his face. To see our coach happy and cheering us on feels great. I’m just happy that he’s happy.”  Bishop Kenny did Harder a favor by knocking off postseason nemesis Jacksonville Ribault in the regional semifinals.  “We’ll see what Wednesday brings,” Harder said. “I’ve been looking forward to this … but I haven’t been telling anybody because I didn’t want to look ahead. I knew we had a shot to get there.”  Most of the Seminoles took part in a camp where games were played on collegiate-sized courts, which they’ll see at the RP Funding Center. Waters said the regional title win over Booker felt like a Final Four game. Snipes concurred.  “I think once we get a feel of that court we’re going to be decent,” she said. “I think we’re going all the way.” A fourth state title (Southeast won state titles in 1985, 1990 and 2014) would close the book on a legendary career for Harder that also includes 22 district championships. His team has never finished below a district runner-up and has qualified for regionals every year he’s been at the helm. Harder plans on retiring at the end of the school year.  “This is a special team and a special year,” he said. “Somebody up there is watching out for John Harder. It’s been a wonderful ride and I’ve been so blessed with some great athletes at this school. I’ve come here every day for the last 35 years with a smile on my face. I’ve loved every minute of every day at Southeast High School.”<end_of_turn>

# Homeowner's Association Fines Resident After Car Leaves Penis-Shaped Outline in Snowy Lot

Homeowner's Association Fines Resident After Car Leaves Penis-Shaped Outline in Snowy Lot Fight the power. Homeowner's associations: Generally awful, often evil. Now a comically serious board ruling a development in Tennessee with a frail fist has taken that reputation to new heights by fining a resident $100 after her car inadvertently left a penis-shaped outline in the condo complex's snowy parking lot. This tale of misbegotten power and beautiful comeuppance comes from a woman named Kathryn, who shared her story with The Drive after venting about the bizarre experience on Reddit. Kathryn asked that we not use her last name, but she provided email proof of what might be the most asinine complaint we've ever read. The trouble began early one cold morning in late January following a light snowfall overnight. It was barely a dusting, and Kathryn and her husband left for work and lived their lives like any other. But the next day, Kathryn was shocked to find an email in her inbox notifying her that she'd been fined $100 because her car had violated the HOA's rules on "displaying offensive images or slogans." More ominously, the board claimed to have photographic evidence of the obscenity in question. Confused and annoyed, Kathryn pressed them for more information. Their response stands tall in the self-own hall of fame, along with the following photo. "Your car, specifically the Honda, left this offensive image on the ground after you left," the email read. "I believe you will see why we have had complaints about it. One of our residents took the photo and reported it to us out of concern for our younger residents." Finally, somebody thinks of the children. The picture shows a blob of clear pavement on the snow-covered lot where the car, a Honda Insight, sat and blocked the snow from accumulating. It's a weird sight; there are no tire tracks visible because it was still snowing when Kathryn and her husband left in the morning, which filled in the clearing's edges a bit where the pavement was colder before it stopped. If you squint, and if you're really looking for it, okay, it kind of looks like a strange representation of male genitalia. Clearer is the fact that we never want to meet the person who made that report. Once Kathryn figured out what exactly the email was referring to—and once she stopped laughing—she fired off an angry counter. How could she possibly control the way the snow fell around her car? Didn't the bylaws state that offensive imagery had to be purposeful? She refused to pay the fine, threatened legal action, and received the following in response: "We understand. We will not be pursuing this further, in good faith pursuant to the wording of the by-laws." That's probably about as close to an apology as you'll ever get from an HOA without actually getting lawyers involved, so all's mostly well that ends well. For what it's worth, this isn't the first time Kathryn and her husband have tangled with their condo overlords. She also claims the board's former president arranged to have her car towed from the lot for expired tags when the replacements got delayed in the mail by one day. That story, along with a war's worth of other battles she's had to wage in her complex, can be read over at the ever-entertaining r/f**kHOA subreddit. We've detailed other stories of neighborhood tyrants run amok, like the homeowner's association in California that attempted to fine residents for keeping their garage doors closed in a misguided effort to root out illegal living space conversions. This doomed quest quest to pin an unintentional penis drawing on a resident's car seems even more insane at first. But you know what they say: It takes one to know one. Got a tip?

# Bizarre Nubia Alpha 'wearable phone' dubbed the weirdest gadget of MWC 2019

A ‘wearable smartphone’ with a flexible display that wraps around the wearer’s wrist has been hailed as the most bizarre device on display at the Mobile World Congress technology show.  The Nubia-α has a four-inch flexible OLED display built into a watch strap as well as a five-megapixel camera and can be used to make calls and send messages.  It’s basically a wearable smartwatch and has already been dubbed ‘the weirdest smartwatch I’ve ever seen’ by one tech journalist.  The device comes as the technology industry has welcomed its first folding smartphones – both Huawei and Samsung have revealed flexible screen devices in the last week that will go on sale this year, while Chinese firm TCL has also announced a concept for foldable screens on mobile devices.  Chinese firm Nubia – part of telecoms firm ZTE – say that while their device is naturally considered a wearable, the big screen akin to a smartphone that it houses puts it in a new category, one which combines aspects of a smartwatch with those of a phone.  The company says the device can also be used as a health and fitness tracker, like many other wearables, and contains a battery that can last up to two days.  It runs a custom version of Google’s Android operating system, and also includes mobile payment capabilities, with the first version of the Alpha due to go on sale in Europe and North America in April.  The Nubia will also support hands-free gesture control, Nubia said, meaning users will be able to navigate between different menu screens of the device.  Flexible screens of all sizes are expected to become increasingly popular in the coming years – LG announced its first rollable television at the beginning of 2019, and in the wake of Huawei and Samsung’s foldable phone announcements, reports have already surfaced claiming Apple is developing its own version of such a device.<end_of_turn>

# RSS-affiliate demands ordinance to prevent tribal evictions

ALSO READ  
													
													 The Union government should either come out with an ordinance or appeal before the Supreme Court to stay its order on evictions of more than 10 million tribals and other forestdwellers, the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram (VKA) said on February 25.  The organisation said in its statement that two weeks after the Supreme Court order was passed the Union government has remained silent leading to anger and concern in the tribal societies. The Supreme Court order, it said would only add to the decades of injustice that tribal and other forest-dwelling communities had faced.  VKA is an affiliate of the Rashtrayia Swyamsevak Sangh which works amongst tribals. It, like other RSS affiliates, has rarely in the past five years taken public positions criticising the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government.  It said, “The Central government should either bring out an ordinance or it should file a review petition to ensure that a stay order is secured against action on those whose claims have been rejected. Then later it can think of a permanent solution.”  On the same day, the Campaign for Survival and Dignity, a group of many tribal organisations across country, which has been behind the Forest Rights Act since 2004, announced a country-wide mass agitation against the Central government’s role in allowing the Supreme Court to pass the eviction order. Announcing a slew of protests across the country by different tribal right groups, it said, “The Supreme Court's order to evict over one million claimant families is the direct result of the BJP government's decision to not say a word in court for the last four hearings. This is only the last step in this government's consistent sabotage of this law, from May 2014 to the present.”  The statements of the two organisations come in response to the Supreme Court order on February 13, demanding that states evict all tribals and other forestdwellers whose claims under the Forest Rights Act had been rejected. The court has given time till July to all states to ensure the evictions. The Union government had failed to appear in several hearings on the matter and to defend either the law or argue against summary mass-scale evictions. The Union tribal affairs ministry’s reports indicated that the order would impact around 1.89 million tribal and other forest-dwelling households whose claims to traditional lands had been rejected under the Forest Rights Act.  Since then the Indian National Congress president Rahul Gandhi has asked all states it governs – Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Puducherry, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab to file interim petitions against the Supreme Court orders. The Union government has so far taken out only one clarification stating, “It’s clarified that government of India, ministry of tribal affairs is well aware of its responsibilities of defending the constitutional validity of the Forest Rights Act and the Ministry will do everything at its disposal to safeguard the interests of the tribals as it has been doing so far.”  VKA in its statement, added, “An NGO working on wildlife in 2009 raised a challenge about the constitutional validity of this law before the Supreme Court. Later retired a group of forest officials also joined this. It is known to the world that all these people were against the law from the very beginning. According to media…government lawyers sat quiet in the last three hearings of the case before the Supreme Court and in the last hearing (on February 13) they were not even present.”  It noted that the Union tribal affairs ministry had not presented the full facts before the Supreme Court and said, “The Union government should order the tribal affairs ministry to present all facts before the Supreme Court. This process shall take some time, therefore the Union government should immediately come out on this issue and clarify the situation assuring the tribal society and other impacted people that the government will not let any injustice happen.”  Different states in the meanwhile have taken active steps to respond to the Supreme Court order. Madhya Pradesh state government set up a group of ministers to deal with all the issues arising out of the Supreme Court eviction orders. Madhya Pradesh has so far rejected claims by 362,024 families and these potentially face evictions after the Supreme Court order.  Chhattisgarh, facing a forced eviction of potentially 462,403 families have already placed administrative orders in place to prevent evictions as it goes about reviewing all the cases to ensure previous government followed laid down regulations in rejecting these claims.  The issue has turned a political hot-potato with the country gearing for general elections and promises to become another key poll issue between the incumbent BJP and the opposition. BJP lost the assembly elections recently in three states with considerable presence of tribal population - Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The Congress by taking an early position on the evictions order hopes to burnish its pro-tribal image building on its claim to having introduced the Forest Rights Act in the first place. Many of the tribal-dominated constituencies were swept up by the BJP in the 2014.<end_of_turn>

# Katya Jones: Strictly star dons racy leather dress to join husband Neil Jones at theatre

Katya Jones attended Rock Of Ages musical last night to watch her co-star Kevin Clifton make his debut on the show. The Strictly Come Dancing professional dancer showcased her toned pins in a racy off-the-shoulder number which featured long sleeves and a zip up the front. Wearing her hair loose in a straight style, the 29-year-old Russian dancer teamed her figure-hugging outfit with a pair of lace-up ankle boots and two gold chains. The braless star added a pop of colour to her ensemble with a slick of red lipstick and enhanced her features with smokey eyeshadow and fluttery eyelashes. Katya, who shocked Strictly fans up and down the country when she kissed her dance partner Seann Walsh, 33, during the most recent series, attended the show with her husband of five years Neil Jones. The brunette beauty and her 36-year-old husband, who also dances on the BBC show, put on a united front as they walked the red carpet in coordinated outfits. Neil wore black T-shirt and jeans with a green studded shirt for their evening out at the New Wimbledon Theatre. The dancing duo were in attendance to show their support for fellow Strictly star Kevin Clifton, 36, who joined the cast of the musical after winning the BBC ballroom dancing competition with Stacey Dooley in December. He will play the role of Stacee Jaxx in the touring theatre show, which includes classic rock anthems such as We Built This City and The Final Countdown, till April.<end_of_turn>

# Former Instinet CEO tapped to head new Wall Street-backed exchange

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jonathan Kellner, former chief executive officer of brokerage Instinet, was on Wednesday named CEO of the Members Exchange, a new low-cost electronic bourse being built by a group of financial heavyweights to challenge the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Kellner is the first publicly announced employee of the would-be exchange, known as MEMX, which is backed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Charles Schwab Corp, Citadel Securities, E*TRADE Financial Corp, Fidelity Investments, Morgan Stanley, TD Ameritrade, UBS, and Virtu Financial. The consortium said in January it was forming MEMX to reduce fixed costs for its members and to increase transparency around how those costs are set. “The launching of MEMX, with the backing of a diverse and large cross-section of leading market players, is a transformative development that will drive a more competitive equity trading environment,” Kellner said in a statement. Brokers have long complained about what they say are unjustifiably high fees for essential data on stock trades charged by the big three U.S. exchange groups, which control 12 of the 13 U.S. stock exchanges. The incumbents are Intercontinental Exchange Inc, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Inc and Cboe Global Markets Inc. IEX Group runs the only independent U.S. stock exchange and does not charge for market data. MEMX is expected to be up and running late this year or in early 2020, subject to regulatory approval. Kellner, an industry veteran, was tapped by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in October to build out the firm’s institutional crypto-trading offerings. But in January, Coinbase said it had pulled the plug on that effort and that Kellner would not be joining after all. Kellner spent more than 11 years at Instinet and previously held key positions at Schwab and Morgan Stanley. Instinet was a part of Reuters from 1987 until its 2001 initial public offering. It is now owned by Nomura Group. Reporting by John McCrank; Editing by Nick Zieminski<end_of_turn>

# EastEnders villain Janine could make shock comeback to Albert Square

Actress Charlie Brooks hinted she would like to play serial killer Janine Butcher again. Janine, a regular in the soap between 1999 and 2014, was last seen fleeing Walford after dodging a murder charge. Having killed Michael Moon in the middle of a bitter custody battle over daughter Scarlett, Janine escaped to France with plans to scam a couple who had won the lottery. Charlie, 37, has never ruled out a return. And yesterday she drove fans into a frenzy when she told ITV's Good Morning Britain: "Never say never." But she quickly added: "I don't have plans to go back." Last week, the mum of one also told Jamie Theakston and Lucy Horobin on Heart FM: "I'm lucky because there's great potential with her. I quite like to think of her as a hippy on the beach. "She has the ability to be anyone and go anywhere." Since leaving the soap, Charlie has carved out a theatre career and is currently starring in All In A Row at London's Southwark Playhouse. The play has sparked controversy as it features a puppet playing the part of a severely disabled and non-verbal autistic child. The actress said yesterday: "Puppetry can be really engaging – it's really powerful. "What we have to remember is that there are some very distressing scenes. To have a child in it would be very draining." If you would like to contact Ruth, you can do so by writing to ruth.mckee@dailystar.co.uk<end_of_turn>

# GOG ending rebates for regional pricing differences

Digital games store GOG will soon stop offering customers store credit equivalent to how much less their purchase would cost in North America, a scheme they call Fair Price Package. It’s GOG’s solution to the prickly problem of regional pricing, which often means people outside North America end up paying a higher price in their native currency. GOG have themselves been paying for these rebates, which they claim average 12% of the game’s price and go up to 37%, but say they can no longer afford to do that. This is a mite concerning given rumours surrounding GOG’s recent layoffs, though GOG say it’s to help them secure more releases by giving developers a better cut of sales.  Like largely not using DRM and mostly making its GOG Galaxy client optional for downloading and playing games, offering refunds on regional pricing inconsistencies is a policy that makes GOG feel more fair in ways than some other stores. Alas, the end is nigh.  GOG intend to end the Fair Price Package program on March 31st. Until then, you’ll still receive GOG Wallet store credit on applicable purchases. Credit will last for one year before vanishing into the cyberaether.  “In the past, we were able to cover these extra costs from our cut and still turn a small profit. Unfortunately, this is not the case anymore,” GOG said in yesterday’s announcement. “With an increasing share paid to developers, our cut gets smaller. However, we look at it, at the end of the day we are a store and need to make sure we sell games without a loss.”  They say this change “is not a decision we make lightly.” It sounds like they’re not just cutting costs, mind, and intend to pass some of the freed funds onto developers.  GOG claim that with more cash in their pocket, they “will be able to offer better conditions to game creators” to remain a competitive and attractive option to devs who are now seeking a bigger share of sales. They haven’t announced any firm plans yet.  Store cuts are a hot topic in the industry right now. 30% has been the standard cut for big stores to take from each sale for years, then things started to change in December 2018. Valve’s Steam started taking a smaller cut from big-selling games, going down to 25% after $10 million (£8m) in sales then 20% after $50 million (£40m). That was a pretty small change to placate big publishers, and evidently was too small. Mere days later, Fortnite and Unreal Engine mob Epic Games announced they were launching their own store and would only take a flat 12% of sales. Epic backed this up by flashing megabucks to fund giveaways and exclusives, leading to the Epic Games Store taking big-budget games like The Division 2 and Metro Exodus away from Steam.  GOG being a smaller store than Steam in numerous ways, trying to stay competitive by cutting their take is perhaps sensible. It’s still bad news for people in regions with shonky regional pricing. Perhaps GOG are counting on customers believing in the company’s DRM-free mission and wanting them to thrive, enough that this is accepted as a necessary evil. Which, given that people who use GOG tend to very intently shop at GOG rather than rival stores, may prove right.  This is a little concerning coming so soon after last week’s layoffs. GOG said that only “around a dozen” people were let go as part of reorganisation and that they were actually hiring for many more positions. However, one of the laid-off employees whispered to Kotaku that “GOG’s revenue couldn’t keep up with growth” and the company have been “dangerously close to being in the red.” Mysteries.<end_of_turn>

# Terwilliger is ESU's man

EAST STROUDSBURG – After a late-season two-game interim head coaching stint, East Stroudsburg University officially inked its coach of the future – Jimmy Terwilliger. The former 2005 Harlon Hill winner, who took the Warriors to the national semifinal as a quarterback in 2005, Terwilliger was named as the next head coach on Monday. “It’s time to resurrect this thing,” Terwilliger said Monday. Terwilliger stepped in last fall when longtime head coach Denny Douds resigned at the end of the team’s final home game. Terwilliger took over the head coaching duties on an interim basis, beating Clarion for his first victory as a head coach. “I am extremely pleased that Coach Terwilliger has accepted our offer to become our permanent head football coach,” said Gary Gray, ESU Director of Athletics. “We have complete confidence in Jimmy’s ability to recruit, coach and lead the program in a positive direction. We’re very excited to start this new chapter in the storied history of Warrior football.” ESU is excited to have him. President Marcia Welsh said she knew when Terwilliger was promoted as an associate head coach prior to the 2018 season that the former quarterback was ready to be the school's next head coach. On Monday, the university made it official. "You go out and do a national search and you bring in a coach and you hope that you made a good choice," Welsh said. "We look at Jimmy and we know that we made a good choice." Gray has every confidence that the decision made is the perfect fit. "He's ready to do this," Gray said. "He's on fire. He's excited. A lot of what we do is centered around enthusiasm and that's contagious. He had a very good recruiting class. He has great vision and plan for the program." For Terwilliger and ESU, there are preliminary talks of building a newly designed stadium - but those plans are still in the early talking process. Welsh said she's not looking for a fresh coat of paint for a "two year fix." Terwilliger's hire doesn't figure to be a "fix" either. A former player who took ESU to new heights, Terwilliger's quarterback records on the field - including his 50-touchdown season in 2005 - speak for themselves. He's known ESU football all of his life as his father, Mike, is still the team's quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator. Monday's announcement, Jimmy said, was a "dream come true to me." "This is where I want to be," Terwilliger said. "This is where I call home. This is East Stroudsburg University where Warriors belong. This has always been home to me and I want to give this place back everything it gave to me. I had the greatest experience in my life playing football here." After Douds resigned near the end of last year, Terwilliger took over the job on an interim basis. He led the team the final two weeks of the season, and in the offseason recruited 24 new players. Someone with extreme drive to be successful, ESU's two-win season of a year ago fell short in many ways for the new coach. Terwilliger declined to give what kind of record in 2019 would he consider to be successful. Terwilliger said he credits the staff for the success on the recruiting trail, building new relationships. ESU will continue its spring drills and then come fall, try to improve on a 2018 season in which it struggled. "To me, to go from 2-9 to 9-2, those are byproducts of great working in and out," Terwilliger said. "I want to see improvement in all areas, offensively, defensively and special teams. I want to push the limit."<end_of_turn>

# USC has no players at one position on its spring roster. Here are its options now

When it comes to specialists for South Carolina football in 2019, Gamecock fans know the main returning faces — junior kicker Parker White is back after a bounceback sophomore campaign in which he made 13 of 16 field goal attempts, as is senior punter Joseph Charlton, who averaged nearly 45 yards per boot last year, tied for sixth in the SEC.  As spring practices begin for the Gamecocks, coach Will Muschamp has two names he’s considering to take Asbury’s place.  “Collin Bunch, whose father played here, from Pendleton High School, we’ve added to our roster, and Jackson Locklier, who played at River Bluff and Charleston Southern, we’ve added to our roster as well,” Muschamp said at his opening press conference Tuesday.  Sign Up and Save  Get six months of free digital access to The State  #ReadLocal  Locklier was rated a four-star long snapping prospect by Kohl’s Kicking and played tight end and defensive end for River Bluff, graduating in 2018.  The Gamecocks held a tryout for long snappers last fall when Asbury was recovering from an ACL tear, but Muschamp said his staff didn’t find Bunch and Locklier until another tryout this offseason.  “We did one going into spring, knowing our situation, and both of those guys were guys we wanted to take a look at,” Muschamp said. Walk-on Matthew Smith, who backed up Asbury last season, is no longer listed on the team’s roster.  South Carolina opens spring practice on Wednesday. The annual Garnet and Black spring game will take place on April 6 at Williams-Brice Stadium, televised on the SEC Network at noon.<end_of_turn>

# Sheriff Tony Guy seeking re-election, says he's implemented needed reforms

Sheriff Tony Guy has announced his re-election bid, saying he has implemented reforms to an office that was in desperate need of improvement when he took over in January 2016. “I kept every promise and did everything I said I would and more, but we can do even better,” said Guy, a 57-year-old Hopewell resident, who, like Democratic sheriff candidate Wayne Kress, is a retired state trooper. In 2015, Guy beat Kress by about 4,400 votes, or 55 percent to 45 percent, to replace then-Sheriff George David, who had lost to Kress in the Democratic primary. Guy’s campaign website is sherifftonyguy.com and his campaign Facebook account is Sheriff Tony Guy. Guy said that when he became sheriff “no other office in county government was more in need of reform than the Beaver County Sheriff’s Office” and that voters chose his “management and leadership experience in command positions” to fix the problems. Although it resulted in legal action, Guy stood by the firing of seven deputies on his first day in office. “I fired the deputies who had tarnished the reputation of a once-respected department,” he said. “Prior to taking office, openings in the Beaver County Sheriff’s Office had been filled through nepotism and cronyism. We can’t go back to the old way of doing things.” Three deputies sued the county after they were fired, but the cases have been settled. Guy said he has “taken huge steps in professionalizing” the sheriff’s office, including implementing a system for hiring and promotions based on testing, interviews and background investigations. He also said his department is the only one within county government that does performance evaluations on all employees. “We’re actually leading the county on some of these initiatives,” he said. “It’s something that every professional organization should be doing.” Guy said his changes have improved safety and training for deputies, using grant money to update equipment, including Tasers, and requiring body cameras “to enhance accountability and keep our deputies safer.” Calling it one of his proudest accomplishments, Guy recalled having his budget cut by about 20 percent in 2016, the lowest budget since 2008, but still making “positive changes” to the office.<end_of_turn>

# D1 state girls' hockey: Shrewsbury finally nets quarterfinal victory

WESTBORO — Delaney Couture has piled up the points and the accolades since she was a seventh-grader skating a regular shift for the Shrewsbury High girls’ hockey team.  However, one thing has eluded the smooth-skating, sniper-shooting wing and the rest of the Colonials over the last five season — an extended playoff run.  The Colonials made it to the quarterfinals twice and were eliminated in the first round three times while going 4-5. Now a senior, Delaney is fully aware this is her final opportunity to make a lasting postseason impression.  “The big factor I would just say is revenge,” the five-time T&G Super Team selection said after the Colonials began their quest with a 4-0 win over Bourne on Wednesday night in a Division 1 state tournament prelim game at NorthStar Ice Sports.  “I’m sick of losing in the quarters, and I’m just going to do whatever I can to make our team go as far as it can. I know this is my last year, and I want our last game ever together to be at the Garden.”  TD Garden will host the state hockey finals in mid-March.  The next step in the journey to Boston will take place Saturday or Sunday, when 15th-seeded Shrewsbury (13-5-3) meets No. 2 Duxbury (19-0-2) at a time and place to be determined.  Bourne, the 18th seed in the field of 27, finished 12-7-2 as it was outshot, 37-6.  “Overall, I was pretty happy,” Shrewsbury coach Frank Panarelli said. “I thought we controlled the play, and they really didn’t get too many quality chances on our goalie (Riley MacCausland).  “But we have to step it up going on in the playoffs. We’ll be facing a tougher team than we did tonight.”  The first line of senior center Lauren Moran, junior wing Grace Felicio and Couture accounted for the Colonials’ point production. Couture had two goals and two assists, Moran two goals and an assist, and Felicio added two assists.  Moran scored six goals in 14 games during the regular season, but netted two in a span of 6 minutes, 29 seconds, bridging the first and second periods to make it 2-0. Both came off feeds from Couture.  “Well, Delaney did a great job setting up,” said Moran, who is headed to St. Anselm to play softball. “She came down low both times, saw me open in front of the net. I called for it, she passed it perfectly to me, and I was able to tap it in.”  The second goal was a definite highlight as it came on an in-air tap-in 28 seconds into the second period and in front of a very vocal and extremely elated student cheering section.  “She’s more of a playmaker with Delaney and Grace doing the bulk of the scoring on that line,” Panarelli said of Moran. “It was good to see Lauren get a couple, though.  “Good for her confidence and, again, playoff time, she’s a senior so she knows this is it, this is her last run toward it, and she stepped up tonight.”  Couture then wowed the crowd with a pinpoint laser to the left, or blocker, side from the left circle for an unassisted power-play goal about six minutes later. She added a second strike midway through the third to push her career totals, per T&G records to 184 goals and 269 points.  It was quality rather than quantity for MacCausland, as she stopped a clean breakaway in the second and made a dynamic pad save at the left post early in the third while on her way to her fourth shutout in 14 starts.  —Contact Rich Garven at rgarven@telegram.com.

# Dave Caldwell says Marcell Dareus approached Jags' front office to restructure deal

The Jacksonville Jaguars started the day on the right foot as they announced that nose tackle Marcell Dareus would be returning to the team this offseason after restructuring his deal. However, the biggest takeaway from his return was the fact that he was the driving force behind it. According to Jags general manager Dave Caldwell, Dareus approached them about restructuring because he’s enjoyed the time he spent in Jacksonville.  Dareus, 28, was brought on to the Jags’ roster in October of 2017 via a trade with the Buffalo Bills which sent the Bills a sixth-round selection. Since joining the team, Dareus has arguably been the Jags’ most consistent defensive lineman not named Calais Campbell, and has especially given them elite play against the rush. This was something Jags coach Doug Marrone discussed Wednesday when he took the podium at the combine and added that he believes that Dareus is just scratching the surface with the team.  Dareus’ restructured deal freed up $5 million in cap space for the Jags as the organization decreased his 2019 base salary of $8.335 million to $2.835 million. The restructured deal also shortened the entirety of his contract by removing a year from it and replaced his $2 million bonus that was due by March 15.  During his season and a half tenure in Jacksonville, Dareus has played in 24 games and started in 16, while accumulating 52 tackles, two sacks and three tackles for loss. He also was able to finish his first season with the Jags with a Pro Football Focus grade of 79.7 and 80.9 last year.<end_of_turn>

# 3D design, production for all at new tech center in Istanbul

In the past when you wanted to develop a 3D production or create a prototype in Turkey, the only places available were industrial areas. However, the digital design and production center that opened in Istanbul Technical University (İTÜ) Arı Technokent last week has prepared an environment that can provide nearly all kinds of digital printing in Turkey and offers information on digital printing.  Çınar Topaloğlu, the co-founder of Tridi, operating İTÜ Magnet Fab center, which was opened with the support of the Istanbul Development Agency (İSTKA), provided information about how this center will function.  "There are two basic service models. The first one includes digital production and design activities. Within the context of these services, we offer support to users in industrial design, 3D printing, silicon molding and laser cutting. We have more than 20 material options as part of the 3D printing service in the center. It is possible to produce every type of product in every field, from studentship to entrepreneurship, from artistry to industrial companies thanks to the equipment, methods and materials. The second model is Tridi Co-Making. We present a physical environment where people can develop their own prototypes and that features the equipment and facilities necessary during the production development process. Training on usage of the equipment is provided. Besides, those who work in this field can find everything they need in the store at the center. This way, it is possible to develop products quickly in solidarity and through sharing without being interrupted and losing time," he said. 
 
 
The office space of Tridi which operates at İTÜ Magnet Fab Center.  Highlighting the center's location in İTÜ Arı Technokent, which pioneers entrepreneurs, and its support from İSTKA, Topaloğlu noted that affordable digital technology will be sustainable in the future through this process. Topaloğlu added, "We will offer free and affordable services to enterprises, entrepreneurs and students thanks to the public support."  Associate professor Deniz Tunçalp, the general director of İTÜ Arı Technokent, which hosts the İTÜ Magnet Fab-Tiridi center, also stressed: "There is a demand for prototyping and custom productions so that hardware entrepreneurs and research and development-oriented companies can develop their projects. As İTÜ Arı Technokent, we started off with the support of İSTKA, saying that we should have a production center that satisfies these needs with the most current technologies and modern hardware substructure, and all companies and entrepreneurs should benefit from it. With this center, we aim to add value to a wide variety of middle and small-sized industries as well as to assist students and to individual users in the prototyping and pre-series production periods."  Development bank support  In the digital design and production center at İTÜ Magnet, there are a total of 27 3D printers, two laser cutting machines, four CNC machines, one silicone molding machine, one electronic circuit printer, one sanding machine, one vacuum heat shaping machine, two lathes, one desktop milling machine and one spraying booth. It is expected that more than 1,000 prototypes will be created and over 500 industrial design projects will be carried out in the center, a space that incorporates joint working and productions with a large machine section featuring 3D printers, lasers, CNC and silicone molding machines.<end_of_turn>

# Calgary agency helps low-income residents file their taxes

CTV News Calgary Latest Videos  Calgary agency helps low-income residents file their taxes  Published Wednesday, February 27, 2019 5:27PM MST Last Updated Wednesday, February 27, 2019 6:20PM MST Tax deadline day is still over two months away, but some of the first free tax clinics will be open this week to help those with financial difficulties.  Marricel and Sam Concepcion didn’t know anything about filing taxes and making a budget before they moved to Canada from the Philippines.  “Coming from a low-income family, it’s not that easy to stretch your budget.”  Seeking help for their financial troubles, the couple sat down for a free workshop on financial literacy put on by Momentum, a Calgary credit counseling agency.  The couple then learned about a special grant program that’s been offered for the past few years.  The ATB Tax Time Savings Program is offering 300 people the opportunity to earn a massive 50 percent interest rate after just one year of saving their refund.  When they put away between $200 and $1,000 of their return, ATB will pay out half of the money they save for a period of one year. Organizers hope it will teach families and individuals about good financial health.  Carolyn Davis, the community engagement director at Momentum, says that right now is the perfect time to start to think about your finances because you’ll need to files your taxes too.  “One of the big reasons that tax filing is important if you have more of a modest income, is that tax time is the way that you get access to grants and credits and programs that can help families make ends meet.”  Davis says the main goal of putting away the money in the program is to emphasize the importance of having an emergency fund for your family.  “Over 50 percent of Canadians do not have an emergency fund and that’s a really big deal for all of us. Without $500 in the bank, we are way more susceptible to eviction and other crises that can come, so we really want every Canadian to have an emergency fund.”  The Concepcions are very happy about the program too.  “They are teaching you how to save which is great. It’s a great program I think,” Marricel says.  Momentum is offering the free tax clinics at 40 locations across Calgary, including at the Centre for Newcomers.  The organization also offers a variety of resources to help families get a hold on their finances and further their careers. For more information, you can dial 211 or go to Momentum’s website.

# Chloe RTW Fall 2019

Galleries Collection “Through Karl [Lagerfeld] is how I’ve known Chloé since I was a child,” said Natasha Ramsay-Levi, who selected six archival photographs and quotes representing the dearly-departed designer’s 25 years at the brand and had them printed on postcards as mementos for every guest at Thursday morning’s show. “The clothes joined the personality of the woman rather than taking all the personality of a woman,” she said in praising Lagerfeld’s work, which was unstructured, weightless and totally feminine – albeit of a different time. Her fall 2019 collection was less romantic romp than full gallop through the everyday wardrobe needs of today’s active women, featuring equestrian tailoring bent to a woman’s will. Chic without screaming so, it was all about wearability with considered details.  Take the Prince of Wales check riding coat as an example, in a stretch wool crepe beautifully ruched to fit the waist, fastened at the side with a long row of polished silver buttons, and worn with cropped flared trousers for a new take on the suit. Or consider the burgundy check wool minidress with a wrap effect at the waist,. Both are examples of the soft French touch she brought to traditionally rugged Highlands fabrics. A gray window-pane check kilt was slit on either side and topped with one of Chloe’s signature feminine blouses that had ribbed knit cuffs for an added comfort factor. Fall’s clunky ankle boots also came with clever ribbed knit sock cuffs.  Ramsay-Levi also said she was feeling inspired by the pioneering female French sailor Florence Arthaud braving the wild, so there were lots of nautical knits, including a rust funnel neck cardigan, shaped to the waist, over a moss green military skirt with patch pockets. A funnel neck, camel hair cape also looked particularly covetable (she reined in the volume for city living), as did the season’s must have talisman, a horseshoe pendant necklace with goat hair and shark tooth charms.    Adding elements of romance were Highlands landscape Toile de jouy minidresses, and a T-shirt picturing a happy couple walking in a winter seascape. If there was a weak spot, it was a few of the dresses, in dreary color combinations of devore velvet, or floral patterned silk georgette, that could have had a bit more oomph. She made for it in the end, though, with a navy blue minidress jangling silver embroideries like lucky charms. Borrowing a Lagerfeld phrase from 1977 to describe it, it was a dress “to transform everyday life into a fairytale.”<end_of_turn>

# 9th Circuit revives Muslims’ lawsuit charging FBI with spying at Irvine mosque

A federal appeals court decided unanimously Thursday to revive much of a proposed class action lawsuit brought by Southern California Muslims against the FBI, charging they were subjected to surveillance because of their religion.  The decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will return the case to a district court for further review.  The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU of Southern California, charged that for at least 14 months in 2006 and 2007, the FBI paid a confidential informant to spy on Muslims in Southern California’s mosques and elsewhere.  The informant used audio and video equipment to secretly record Muslims at various places, including at places of prayer, primarily in Orange County.  The operation was part of a counterterrorism investigation known as Operation Flex. The Muslim community contended it amounted to “dragnet surveillance” whose purpose was to indiscriminately “gather information on Muslims.”  The FBI contended the operation was intended to prevent terrorist acts and focused on fewer than 25 people.  A federal judge dismissed the bulk of the lawsuit in 2012 after the government argued it could not defend itself without disclosing state secrets.  In a 103-page decision, the 9th Circuit said the district court should not have dismissed claims based on state secrets without more review.  “The legal questions presented in this case have been many and difficult,” Judge Marsha S. Berzon wrote for the court, and “will reverberate in the context of the larger ongoing national conversation” about how to respond to threats of terrorism “without fueling a climate of fear rooted in stereotypes and discrimination.”  The government’s contention that the suit cannot be defended without disclosing matters of national security “does not warrant dismissal of this litigation in its entirety,” the court said.  “The fundamental principles of liberty include devising means of forwarding accountability while assuring national security,” wrote Berzon, a Clinton appointee.<end_of_turn>

# Lancaster tragedy is motivation for ‘Titan Games’ finalist

A tragedy is a source of motivation for Christiana Rugloski, reports LancasterOnline. Rugloski is a finalist in the NBC athletic competition series “The Titan Games,” where she showcases her strength and agility in tasks that involve swinging around wrecking balls and playing tug of war with giant poles the size of pickup trucks. For Rugloski, her drive to make the most out of every opportunity comes, in part, from a 2014 car accident involving a Lancaster family. Rugloski was among those who tried to rescue the Einwechter family when their car flipped into a pond full of 35 degree water in Tennessee. Monique Einwechter and her four children, Titus, Jonathan David, Elise and Enoch were trapped. Rugloski, who was 17 at the time, joined the efforts of the Einwechter father, Jonathan, as he tried to save his family. In the end, Elise and Enoch died. They were 3 years old and 6 weeks old, respectively. “I spent the night with two little boys that were able to get out and asking for their older sister, asking for their mom,” Rugloski told “The Titan Games” cameras. “We didn’t know for a couple hours later what had happened.” The accident changed her perspective, she continued. “It really gave me a whole new appreciation on the shortness of life and what do I want out of life -- what do I want to be remembered for?” Rugloski will be competing for the Titan Champion title on Feb. 28. If she wins, she’ll be awarded $100,000. “The Titan Games” airs at 8 p.m. on NBC.<end_of_turn>

# Amara Enya: “People are looking for transformative change in Chicago.”

Amara Enya: “People are looking for transformative change in Chicago.”  Amara Enya joins the Steve Cochran Show days after she was defeated in the race for mayor. Amara hasn’t decided who she is going to back yet before the runoff. She said she was prepared for the scrutiny she faced but not to the degree that some press took it. She’s concerned about very specific issues that the city needs in order to see actual change. She did not decide what she is going to do next but she’s still committed to the City of Chicago.<end_of_turn>

# JLT SuperCoach Scores

Keep up to date with key SuperCoach scores as they happen in the JLT Series this preseason. We’ll be updating this page at the conclusion of each preseason game, highlighting the SuperCoach relevant players GAME 1: CARLTON vs ESSENDON  The Blues sent out a strong first-up squad, with Patrick Cripps ($648,200) dominating proceedings with 33 disposals and two goals and a SuperCoach score of 124. However it was the new faces at Princess Park that SuperCoaches would have been most impressed by. Will Setterfield ($144,900) finished with 113 points from just 73 per cent game time while former Swan Nic Newman ($394,100) looked at home in his new digs with a solid output of 97 points and arguably could’ve gone better. He looks a lock to make the vacant Sam Docherty role his own. Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre Visit Match Centre However, it was the two most talked about SuperCoach rookies that SuperCoaches were keen on seeing. No.1 pick Sam Walsh ($207,300) finished on 100 points and already looks likes the second-coming of Joel Selwood, meanwhile mature-age pickup, Michael Gibbons ($102,400) showed why he’ll be a cash cow with a tidy score of 68 points. For the Bombers, Dyson Heppell ($551,500) scored 56 points from just 39 per cent game time but it was defender Jordan Ridley ($233,100) who has put himself on the radar after top-scoring for the Bombers with 97 points. While cheap, Joe Daniher ($277,800) didn’t set the SuperCoach world on fire with 35 points, but he ticked the box in his return from persistent groin setbacks and will be ramping up his preparation and game time ahead of Essendon’s second JLT game.<end_of_turn>

# Team Relocate calls it quits following NSW election

Team Relocate calls it quits following NSW election  TEAM Relocate has called it quits following a year-long campaign to have the $534 million Tweed Valley Hospital moved from State Significant Farmland at Cudgen.  During a meeting at the Cudgen Leagues Club on Sunday, Relocate leader Hayley Paddon said the election win by Tweed MP Geoff Provest meant the fight to save the Cudgen site from development "tragically will be lost".  But Ms Paddon said there would be an ongoing war to save the Cudgen Plateau's remaining State Significant Farmland from urban development.  "We accept Relocate's role is finished. We have exhausted all possible actions to save this piece of land," she said.    "We retain our unwavering support for better Hospital services on the Tweed, but it is a pity that the painful consequences of MP Geoff Provest's flawed hospital site choice will only become obvious to the community once the project is well underway," Ms Paddon said.  "I encourage the community to remain vigilant and not be intimidated by bullies insisting opposing opinions are now not to be spoken in public. It is still our democratic right and responsibility to speak up to protect all Tweed farmlands, and our quality of life here in the villages."  Ms Paddon urged local residents to hold Mr Provest to account over his promise the land surrounding the hospital site would not be rezoned.  In her final speech, Ms Paddon thanked everyone who gave their time to the Relocate campaign.  "Over the past year the Relocate team has worked together tirelessly to challenge the lack of prior consultation, the unsubstantiated claims of 'chosen by experts', the contempt for Tweed Council's opinion, and the arbitrary over-ruling of the community's two hard-won principles of protecting State Significant farmland and keeping a three storey limit in coastal villages," she said.    Ms Paddon said the group had received vilification in the community during its campaign and there was "an urgent need to bring about peace and healing for supporters".  "It is now obvious there is no remaining prospect of overturning the massive corporate forces ranged against our volunteer local organisation," she said.  "Rather than pointlessly expose them to any further abuse, we have commenced the formal winding up of our Relocate Association."<end_of_turn>

# Liverpool Handed Champions League Boost as Porto Defender Alex Telles Goes Down With Injury

Liverpool's Champions League hopes have gained an unexpected boost as Porto defender Alex Telles went down with a freak injury at the weekend.  The Reds are set to take on the Portuguese side in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final fixture in just 10 days, and it looks like the Brazilian full-back will not be fit for the clash.  Liverpool advanced from the round of 16 when they convincingly defeated Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena 3-1 courtesy of a two-goal performance from Sadio Mane and a third by Virgil van Dijk. Porto escaped Roma in the second leg of their fixture when Telles stepped up and slotted home a penalty for his side in the 117th-minute.  Telles has been a key player for Porto this season and has proved very reliable from 12 yards out. With just a week and a half until the quarter-final match with Liverpool, Telles is already a major doubt for his squad with the Liverpool Echo reporting that the Brazilian injured his hip taking a spot-kick for his side in their previous match against Braga.  The 26-year-old defender stepped up and scored from the penalty spot for Porto in the 69th minute of the match but instantly went down with an injury after striking the ball. Telles grabbed his hip and was immediately substituted out of the match in favour of Fernando Andrade dos Santos. The injury will come a huge blow to the Portuguese side as Telles has been their main spot-kick taker in the last few months.  Telles converted from the spot four times for Porto in just the month of March and if he is not fit for the match it will likely be Francisco Soares to step up and take a penalty if one is awarded during the match.  Meanwhile, Jurgen Klopp has fielded a full squad in training for the first time all season with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez's return to fitness.  Liverpool take on Southampton in the Premier League on Friday before they host Porto at Anfield on 9 April for the first leg of the quarter-final clash. Porto will have two matches this week before the all-important match against the Reds in the Champions League.<end_of_turn>

# Shoot at Home for Fun and Practice

Shoot at Home for Fun and Practice  From the March 1957 Issue  "There's no question...  ...either that ignorance about guns and the prejudice due to ignorance threaten your right and mine to own guns, to hunt, or to engage in target shooting sports in this country. The cure for these prejudices is to teach prejudiced people the truth about guns, to convince them that shooting is a sport like any other sport, that it's fun, that it can be fun for them. And because pellet guns can be used in thickly populated areas where regular firearms are prohibited, because pellet-gun ranges can be set up cheaply even inside a home, this kind of shooting is growing rapidly in popularity. Proof of the effectiveness of this phenomenon against gun prejudice is the fact that more Americans are shooting for sport today — shooting firearms as well as pellet weapons — than ever before in the history of sport." 
 
That's a paragraph from the middle of an article titled "Shoot at Home for Fun and Practice" in the March 1957 issue of GUNS Magazine. This article's worth your time just for the excellent imagery but it's worth noting how pellet and BB guns have grown in popularity ... since 1957.

# Fake police officer steals marijuana: police

A Montgomery County man is facing charges after authorities say he pretended to be a police officer and stole marijuana from three people. Abington Township police say Dennis McGowen, 42, of Abington, was taken into custody Saturday and is facing charges of robbery, false imprisonment, impersonating a public servant and related offenses. According to police, the incident occurred like this: Three people were sitting in their car in Abington Township around 10 p.m. March 25 when an SUV with blue and white flashing lights pulled up.  A man, whom they believed was a police officer, came up to them yelling that they had been speeding and made an illegal U-turn. He told them, “Give me the weed or I will let my dog out on you.” The complied and saw him driving away with a “Caution K-9 Inside” decal on the back of the SUV. Police found the unoccupied SUV shortly afterwards, and inside, they could see a bag marked “police” and handcuffs. They linked the SUV to McGowen, whom they found was not a police officer, and issued an arrest warrant for him. He was taken into custody Saturday when police saw him walking near his house.<end_of_turn>

# Stop calling me!

The phones have turned on us.  Our little pocket pals seduced us with cheap long distance, unlimited texts, endless apps. Now they beep and shudder and flash with strange numbers at all hours of the day. We answer, and our beloved i­Phone (or Android, or bedside landline) impales our eardrum with a cruiseline ad. It tries to sell us a medical back brace. It threatens to jail us unless we wire our life savings to the IRS.  Spambots nest in call centers on every continent, spewing out phone calls by the millions, saturating the communication networks. Spam and scams swarm through our phones like Hitchcock's birds down the living-room chimney. There is no escape.  More than 10 billion robocalls have been placed so far in 2019, by call-blocking company YouMail's estimate — almost double the same period a year before. Another report by Little Rock-based First Orion, the call-blocking and caller-ID tech company, estimates that nearly half of all cellphone calls will be scams at some point this year.  Assuming the plague ever subsides, how will we forgive our phones?  Press 1 to be transferred to the nightmare realm.  "It started off two or three a day. As time went by it went to 50 or 60," said Matt Briscoe, who switched cell-service providers last summer and brought home the telephonic equivalent of a roach-infested couch.  Briscoe, who runs a community newspaper in Corpus Christi, Texas, hears from far more spambots than humans these days. On March 11 alone, he declined 44 calls purporting to originate from the 704 area code in Albemarle, N.C. — which, given the prevalence of number spoofing, probably means the caller is anywhere but Albemarle, N.C.  "This thing is just buzzing in my pocket constantly," Briscoe said, shortly before his conversation with this reporter was interrupted by his eighth spam call of the morning. "If it's something that seems odd, I won't answer. If I do, nine times out of 10, it's: 'Hello! Would you like to be connected to a health insurance specialist?'"  He has the voice down pat: the cheerful, soulless "Hello!" of a spambot inviting you into an abyssal call center from which you may never return. You've probably heard such a voice yourself.  If not, you will.  Press 2 and scream to disconnect this call.  When Cabot Phillips stepped into the elevator at his apartment building in Alexandria, Va., one evening in February, the elevator was talking.  "Excuse me, is anyone there? Can anyone hear me?" a muffled, presumably human voice said from inside the emergency speaker. Phillips had assumed the speaker was for the fire department. Now, as he ascended to his home, it seemed to be asking him in broken English for $299 in IT charges.  "Sir, you are illegible for your labor, OK?" the spam said.  "Dude, you're calling an elevator," Philips said, and proceeded to his door. He later reflected, "I was hoping an elevator was still a sacred location for peace."  Press 3 for desperate prayer.  Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam. Surely this is spam's most powerful incarnation yet. Earlier outbreaks were at least contained to our email inboxes, or hampered by the relatively primitive telemarketing technology of the last century. Now spam teleports into our purses and nightstands and innermost lives, advertising gastric balloons, demanding debt payments, speaking languages we don't understand. Spam dispatched by fly-by-night ministries even offers to pray for us.  If you plotted a graph of a phone call's usefulness from Alexander Graham Bell's first in 1876 until today, it would climb steadily through the 20th century, rocket skyward with the advent of mobile phones, and then take a U-turn and slap us around the ears with everything the machines have learned.  "We've returned right back to where we were in the '80s," said Jeffrey A. Hansen, an IT consultant who has testified as an expert witness in dozens of consumer lawsuits against robodialers. "Same software. The only difference now is computers are exponentially faster. Tens of millions [of calls] versus thousands."  Hansen traces the phone spam era back to 1974, when two men in Colorado patented an "automatic telephone caller" that simply dialed numbers in numerical sequence — 555-1111, 555-1112 — and blared a prerecorded message at whoever picked up. The technology improved with cell centers' profit margins. By the early 1980s, Computerworld magazine was advertising $13,000 Davox terminals that fused a monitor, keyboard and a phone handset into a telemarketer's dream machine. Brrrrring brrrrring!  Press 4 if this sounds familiar.  In 1991, a committee room full of U.S. senators listened to an answering machine recording that had been annoying people across the country. A disembodied voice boomed over Hawaiian background music "Just think about that, you and a friend or a loved one enjoying the beautiful beaches of Waikiki, and call me at 1-900-321-6666."  "Telannoyers," as some called them, were so endemic at the time that Congress passed laws restricting them, followed by the Do-Not-Call Registry in 2003. For a few years, it seemed like phone spam was contained.  Then came the age of cellphones, international VoIP calls, and offshore call centers that can mask their location to make it look like they are calling you from down the block.  Then came the Trump administration's deregulatory zeal, and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai celebrated a 2018 court ruling undoing Obama-era restrictions on autodialers.  Last April, a Senate subcommittee convened once again to discuss the phone-spam crisis. They interrogated a Florida telemarketer named Adrian Abramovich, who was accused of placing nearly 100 million robocalls with spoofed caller IDs.  "I'm not the kingpin of robocalling that is alleged," Abramovich protested. "I receive four or five robocalls a day ... I've been receiving more than ever, myself. Usually I never answer the phone."  Press 0 to speak to the void.  Abramovich had a point; the problem goes far beyond any one person or call center.  Despite the government's $120 million dollar fine against him in May, the call-blocking company Hiya estimates spam calls increased nearly 50 percent in 2018. They come from all corners of the world — from the marketing departments of major American banks and from clandestine call centers hidden above bars in Delhi, India.  More and more, the spam makes us mistrustful of our own ears.  "I got one just the other night," said Margot Saunders, senior counsel for the National Consumer Law Center. "Someone said, 'Hello Cathy.' I said, there's no Cathy here. A voice said, 'Oh, that's OK. Since I got you ... ' It took a few minutes to figure out I wasn't talking to a real person.  "It's a robot! There's a company making snippets of recorded voice which operators in India press buttons to implement."  Your torment may be recorded for quality assurance.  When Paul Romer got a 6 a.m. call from an unrecognized number at his home in New York last fall, he assumed it was spam and went back to sleep. He later learned it was from Sweden; he'd won the Nobel Prize in economics.  Courtney Kelsey, 21, made the same mistake when she answered her spam-infested iPhone in St. Louis last month, and the man on the other end struggled to pronounce her name.  "I asked him to — whatever list I'm on or wherever they're calling from, could they take me off the list?" Kelsey recalled. "He said, 'I can't hear you. Is this Courtney?' I just hung up."  She ignored a second call, blocked the number, and only later realized it was from the Ritz-Carlton, where she had applied for a serving job.  Oops.  Stay on the line to repeat this call forever.  So it's come to this. We confuse spambots for humans, and humans for spambots. The sci-fi author Charlie Stross once posited a future in which spam becomes so good at mimicking human interaction it becomes self-aware — the "Spamularity." Is that what awaits us if the phones don't shut up?  Saunders, the consumer group lawyer getting spammed by human simulacrums, says the nightmare could be over within months if the telecom giants would invest more in anti-spam technology, which is now spotty at best — or if the government would force them to (as the FCC's Pai has now indicated he might).  If not, she said, the unsustainable status quo will continue.  In the meantime, Briscoe — the Texas newspaper publisher besieged with health insurance calls from not-Albemarle, N.C. — has tried just about every spam-blocking app on the market.  "We've used Robokiller. That hasn't worked with this one at all," he said. "Hiya. Truecaller. Mr. Number. Not even close."  In desperation, he once tried staying on the line with the spam, perhaps hoping to plead for his sanity with the promised "health insurance specialist."  Instead, he said, an agent asked him for his height, weight, birth date and Social Security number. When Briscoe asked for an insurance license number, the agent supplied one as fake as whatever $299 antivirus software is sold in an elevator.  Finally, Briscoe asked his tormentor who he worked for.  "You didn't want no [expletive] insurance anyway," the agent replied and, for a change, hung up on him.

# The best episode of Jordan Peele’s Twilight Zone is free on YouTube

Audiences should always be a little wary of any new show or film that reportedly debuts on April Fools’ Day, especially if it seems too good to be true or too weird to believe. (We’re still withholding judgment on indie auteur Jim Jarmusch supposedly making a super goofy zombie comedy, for instance.) But for some shows, like Jordan Peele’s inherently twist-and-surprise-oriented reboot of the 1950s classic series The Twilight Zone, April 1st seems like an appropriate kick-off date. The show launches today, solely on the subscription-only service CBS All Access.  But for the curious (and the hard-to-convince, since these days, few people seem excited about the prospect of signing on for yet another proprietary, fee-based subscription streaming service), the network has posted an initial episode of the show on YouTube where people in licensed countries can watch it in full without a signup or payment. The episode, “The Comedian,” stars The Big Sick filmmaker and star Kumail Nanjiani as a stand-up comedian who makes a sort of deal with the devil — a mysterious figure played by Tracy Morgan — to become a comedy success.  In her Verge review, critic Samantha Nelson describes the episode as the best of the four installments initially provided for review. She calls it “an enjoyably twisty tale that keeps its intentions hidden and its action suspenseful until the last moments, finishing with a combination of clever visual and narrative touches that fit perfectly with the series’s sense of disturbing mystery.” The episode, written by Key & Peele and Community writer Alex Rubens and directed by Black Mirror’s Owen Harris, may not be available online permanently, so curious viewers should catch it while they can.<end_of_turn>

# Police pursuit Thursday ends with crash

A police pursuit that began in the Anderson County portion of Oliver Springs Thursday evening ended in Roane County when the pursuing officer forced the fleeing suspect off the road.  Shortly after 6:30 pm Thursday, Oliver Springs Police officer David Laxton, driving an unmarked patrol car, tried to pull over a man identified as 39-year-old Eddie Kilby of Sunbright, but Kilby refused to pull over.  The chase continued into Morgan County, where the two vehicles made contact while crossing the Camp Austin Bridge on to Airport Road, then into Roane County on Interstate 40 headed east. Laxton ended the pursuit by using the left side of his crusier to strike the bak right-hand side of Kilby’s Ford Focus, which forced the car off the road and into an embankment.  No one was injured in the pursuit or the crash that ended it. Kilby was arrsted and charged with driving on a revoked license, reckless driving, violating the seat belt law and not having insurance. Other charges could be pending.<end_of_turn>

# Over 2,000 civilians killed in Mali, Niger, Burkina in 5 months: researchers | Africanews

Africa’s Sahel region, which has an influx of military forces including the United Nations, European Union and French troops, has seen a huge surge in civilian deaths in the past five months because of attacks by Islamist militants and ethnic militias, researchers said last week.  The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), which is financed in part by the U.S. State Department, said it had documented 2,151 reported killings in 724 direct attacks targeting civilians between Nov. 1, 2018 and March 23, 2019.  The Sahel – the arid region between the Sahara desert to the north and Africa’s savannas and forests to the south – has become increasingly prone to attacks by well-armed jihadists and reprisals by ethnic militia.  The region experienced one of its bloodiest days in living memory on Saturday, when gunmen in central Mali killed at least 157 people in a village inhabited by Fulani herders — prompting the government to vow to disarm vigilantes.  Islamist militants based in Mali have regrouped after a French intervention in 2013 and now use the country’s north and centre as launchpads for attacks on neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.  Worst hit countries  The biggest surge in fatalities from attacks on civilians was in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, despite the deployment of thousands of Western and United Nations troops to try to contain the violence.  Attacks have hardened existing rivalries between ethnic groups, especially herders and farmers, leading to a series of tit-for-tat reprisals.  In Mali, ACLED documented 547 fatalities in attacks on civilians in the last five months, a more than fourfold increase on the same period a year earlier. In Niger, it documented a fivefold increase, with 78 reported fatalities.  And Burkina Faso, which had previously been known for its stability in a troubled region, suffered 499 fatalities from attacks on civilians, a more than 7,000 percent jump.  The Sahel also includes Mauritania, Nigeria, Chad, and Sudan.  REUTERS<end_of_turn>

# Risk Of Rain 2 Brings An Excellent Roguelike To 3D

Risk of Rain 2 surprise launched in early access last week. The game is a followup to Hopoo Games’ 2013 Risk of Rain, a 2D roguelike platformer. Though it makes some changes to the original formula, Risk of Rain 2 is less a sequel and more the original game remade in 3D. This is great. As in the first game, you choose from a handful of characters with different sets of abilities. The first available character, the Commando, has a dodge roll and a variety of ammo types. Other characters, who can be found in the world or unlocked by completing certain tasks, can freeze enemies, lay down turrets, teleport, or wield swords. Most of a character’s abilities are on cooldowns. You have to manage them carefully to take on the hordes of monsters that spawn as you spend more time in a level, as the game’s difficulty increases over time. Each level has a teleporter you need to find to progress; activating the teleporter spawns a boss. Later levels felt like a moshpit of floating fireballs, laser-shooting giants, and deadly flying jellyfish. As you explore, you collect money from canisters or by killing enemies. Money is used to purchase items, which radically alter your run. Some give you healing; others a higher critical hit chance. Some cause enemies to explode on death; others chain fire or lightning between them. The right combo can make you an unstoppable monster-killing machine. Over the weekend, a quick dip into the game before I did some chores turned into an hour long epic when I found nothing but healing items. I had items that healed me outside of combat, that healed me when I damaged enemies, and that caused enemies to drop healing orbs when killed. Combined with a walloping three drones that also healed me, my items made me unstoppable until a massive horde of enemies overwhelmed me once the game’s difficulty cranked up to a level ominously called “I see you.” Risk of Rain translates well to 3D, for the most part. Pixelated monsters that were kind of adorable in the 2D version are terrifying when their hulking forms materialize beside you in 3D. Items you find attach to your character, and it’s fun to see yourself studded with ukuleles, spectral knife arms, and floating guns. The worlds themselves have more presence than they did in 2D. An ice level feels barren and vast; a fire level, covered in jagged floating islands and bridge-sized chains, is oppressive and threatening. The level layouts aren’t as visually distinct from each other as they were in 2D. Layouts feel repetitive, with little variation from run to run. The landscape itself can be difficult to parse, especially when you’re looking for the teleporter, a flat circle with two claw-like pillars rising out of it. It was easy to spot in 2D once you came across it but can be maddening to find in 3D. In a few games, I realized I had passed and missed the teleporter multiple times because it blended into the landscape. Since the game’s difficulty increases over time, 10 minutes spent backtracking has a high penalty that can make things frustrating. The developer says it’s working on making the teleporter easier to see, so things that frustrate me during early access may change. Advertisement Risk of Rain 2 has new characters, items, and a rare persistent currency called Lunar Coins, which unlock special items and a character. The teleporter also functions differently. Now, it won’t fully charge and let you leave the level unless you’re within a certain radius. This design choice encouraged me to fight bosses where they spawned instead of applying my tactic in the first game of leading them to more strategic spots on the map, which made boss fights feel a little more dynamic. Overall, though, Risk of Rain 2 felt to me like more or less the same game with a new look. I have no problem with this. Risk of Rain is one of my favorite games to be terrible at, and it’s just as fun to try and fail in 3D as it is in 2D. I spent the weekend hopping between Risk of Rain 2 on my PC and Risk of Rain on my Switch, equally delighted and frustrated by both. I’ve yet to check out multiplayer or the daily challenges, but I look forward to doing so. As the game’s early access period continues, I’m hopeful the levels will get more distinct and we’ll see even more items and characters.<end_of_turn>

# Meet The 61-Year-Old Hero Who Gave Birth To Her Own Granddaughter

When Matthew Eledge and his husband Elliot Dougherty began talking about starting a family three years ago, they looked to their tight-knit family for their thoughts. What they got in return was so much more than just advice. A casual joke about Cecile Eledge, Matthew’s mom, lending a hand in the process turned into a miraculous joint effort when she delivered the couple’s daughter, Uma, on March 25. Lea Yribe, Elliot’s sister, supplied the egg, Matthew supplied the sperm, and Cecile served as the surrogate. In an effort to clarify the confusion (of which there was much) about exactly who was involved in the pregnancy and how, Matthew devised a lovingly hilarious way to explain his mom’s participation in the process. “Sometimes even really intelligent people hear this story and think it’s incest,” Eledge told HuffPost. “We get really honest questions from really smart people like, ‘Are you scared of the genetic abnormalities?’ It’s a fine question, it’s a unique situation, but I think it’s easiest to spell it out in layman’s terms: My mother was simply the oven.” Cecile’s pristine health made her a perfectly viable candidate to carry an embryo, despite the fact that, at 61, she had already gone through menopause. So she agreed to be the surrogate for Matthew and Elliot and underwent a series of intense cardiology, pulmonary and physical tests ― and then braced herself to receive bad news. “There was a part of me thinking, it will be a miracle if we pass every test, there is going to be something,” she told HuffPost. “I knew if I wasn’t going to be a healthy candidate, I would never put the baby in jeopardy. Every time I would go talk to another doctor, whether my internist or cardiologist, they looked and said ‘There’s absolutely no reason you can’t do this.’” The family worked with Dr. Carolyn Doherty, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Methodist Women’s Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. She told HuffPost that “pretty much no 61-year-old” would typically be a candidate for surrogacy, citing health risks like high blood pressure, hypertension and heart failure, to name only a few. But Cecile was cleared of any issues and approved to carry her own grandchild. I looked at my husband and said, ‘Well, I guess we’re gonna go on a little adventure. Cecile Eledge There was also the matter of money ― lots and lots of it. Eledge estimates that they spent around $40,000 for the entire process. Using Cecile as a carrier meant that at least they could eliminate the cost of paying a surrogate, which can run between $25,000 and $35,000 on top of any health-related expenses, according to Doherty. “I think the one thing people don’t understand is how expensive it is to hire a surrogate,” Doherty said. “When you have to pay all the medical expenses for a surrogate ― no insurance covers that ― and then that person ends up in the hospital, that could bankrupt someone.” Cecile was put on estrogen to bring back her period, and then she did something she says she never in her wildest dreams ever dreamed she’d do 30 years after her last child was born: She got pregnant. “I looked at my husband and said, ‘Well, I guess we’re gonna go on a little adventure,’” she said. The family was especially fortunate in that the egg retrieval and the insemination process were both successful on the first try. Doherty explained that success is based on the age of the egg. “The fact that we were using very young eggs from Elliot’s sister was really to Cecile’s benefit,” she said. “Plus, they had undergone pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy [chromosomal abnormalities], so we knew to the best of our ability in this day and age that it was genetically normal, which helps out, too.” Pregnancy was a bit different for Cecile this time around than it was 30 years ago. The guidelines of what you can and cannot do have changed, and she said she felt things like morning sickness a bit more intensely. Luckily, though, “We never had any big hiccups ― I can’t complain,” she said. What they did have to deal with, however, were the seemingly unending questions people had about the unusual circumstances surrounding the pregnancy. “There was always general confusion, which never really offended me because it’s such a unique situation,” Matthew said. “There was always serious curiosity and then when you explain it, it was like ‘Oh, this is amazing! Your mom is a rock star.’” “Rock star” doesn’t even begin to cut it, especially considering doctors often won’t allow someone over 50 to undergo in vitro fertilization. Doherty said her practice begins carefully scrutinizing potential surrogates beginning at age 45, but noted it’s not necessarily the case for all reproductive endocrinologists. “The bottom line is my health was good,” Cecile said. “I kept thinking 60s are the new 40s, and people in their 40s are having babies. Sixty-one is just a number; it’s how you feel and your health that was really the motivation.” Cecile was admitted to the hospital earlier than planned when her blood pressure rose into a range that concerned her doctors ― but Uma was strong and healthy, and Cecile delivered the baby vaginally. Cecile said she was calm and relaxed after the birth, knowing her work was done. “A lot of people would say, ‘Are you going to be able to hand this baby over when you’ve been carrying her for nine months?’” Cecile said. “Every time we went to an ultrasound or an appointment, I looked at her as my granddaughter ― never something I owned or possessed. All I visualized was being able to deliver naturally and to hand her over to Matt and Elliot, who were so desperate and so deserving of making their dream a reality.” Matthew revealed there were some visual boundaries in the delivery room ― “We didn’t need to see everything, right?” he said, laughing ― but described seeing his mother as a warrior through the experience. “She tapped into this primitive, visceral spirit and dug deep and just did it. To see her on such an intense level, bringing life to this beautiful, healthy, awesome baby was so cool for me to see.” Considering how open Cecile has been about her incredibly intimate experience, it may come as a surprise to learn she views herself as a private person. But it was important to the entire family that their story be shared ― and each member had his or her own reason as to why. Cecile was floored by the fact that since the pregnancy involved two men trying to have a child, the process was considered uterus donation and was not covered by insurance. “I’ve seen first-hand the discrimination gay couples here who want a child experience,” she said. “They can’t get coverage whatsoever, and I struggle with that. To see discrimination is heartbreaking, and I would like to see that change down the line with our health care and [I want to be an] advocate for that.” Kirk Eledge, Matthew’s father and Cecile’s husband, hopes people can understand that all couples should have the same opportunities. “We have a granddaughter who has the blood and DNA from both Elliot and Matt running through her, and that’s what this whole journey was about,” he said. “They deserve to have families just like everyone else.” Matthew told HuffPost he “crumbles” when he looks at Uma, and plans to tell her “every freaking thing” about her miraculous journey into the world, though he predicts she won’t be quite as taken with the story as the whole family is right now. As for what life is now like for the two new happy dads, things have ― obviously ― changed a lot. Matthew is completely in new parent mode and finds there are often moments when he’s too happily distracted by taking care of Uma to attend to little daily matters. In fact, he recently found himself answering his front door with only one sandal on, and when he brought Uma home from the hospital, he realized he hadn’t brushed his teeth in days. “I was like, oh my god, this is disgusting,” he said, laughing. But at least one thing has stayed nearly the same. “It sounds so cliche and I hate it, but it’s true ― nothing could have prepared me for how I feel right now,” he said. “It gives me a deeper respect and love for my husband to see us be so anxious and nervous and passionate about something together, and it’s refreshing because we’re at a place [in our lives] where we come home, order Thai food and watch ‘Real Housewives of New York City.’ I mean, the first night we came home we watched ‘Housewives,’ but we did it with Uma and Thai food and just switched off shifts.”<end_of_turn>

# Perth, it’s time to behave as tourism chiefs hit town

WA Tourism Minister Paul Papalia has pleaded with West Aussies to be polite, helpful and on their best behaviour when Perth hosts Australia’s biggest tourism convention next week. Organisers have encouraged taxi and Uber drivers, police and city retailers to be positive as the State rolls out the red carpet to more than 2000 international and interstate delegates for the annual Australian Tourism Exchange event. “A good first impression goes a long way,” Mr Papalia said. In an unprecedented show of goodwill, hotels will offer more than $1 million in free accommodation to delegates. The Australian Hotels Association is providing “service with a smile” training for frontline hospitality staff and management. Mr Papalia said the ATE was a once-in-a-generational opportunity to reset WA’s reputation as an attractive and affordable destination. “The last time Perth hosted the ATE was in 2012 when we were in the middle of a mining boom,” he said. “The impression people took away was that Perth was a mining town, with a shortage of hotel rooms and very expensive coffee. “Things have changed completely. That’s the message we want to get across.” The five-day ATE, which starts on Monday, is Australia’s biggest travel and tourism business-to-business event, attracting 600 international and domestic buyers, 1400 sellers from 550 companies and 70 media representatives from more than 30 countries. Special signs in different languages have been installed at Perth Airport, where delegates will also have an opportunity to take the perfect “quokka selfie”. Landmark buildings will be lit in blue throughout the convention to symbolise WA’s blue skies. An extensive familiar-isation program will be available, involving 96 tours to destinations including Kununurra, Albany, Exmouth, Kalgoorlie, Geraldton, Margaret River and Rottnest Island.

# Plans to Redevelop Collin Creek Mall Take a Major Step

In Collin County, plans to revive a dying mall took a major step forward this week. Monday night, Plano's Planning and Zoning Commission voted unanimously to recommend a zoning change that would pave the way for developers to build new apartments and homes, in addition to shops and offices, at Collin Creek Mall. The full city council would still have to approve the zoning change. The developer hopes to break ground in July. "It's just deserted, abandoned almost," Clyde Shank said. Shank has lived near Collin Creek Mall since 1990 and has seen its rise and decline. "We've seen how that mall has gone from the meeting place, the place to go… to nothing," Shank said. Over the years, efforts to redevelop the mall have been complicated by multiple owners, but a new group has acquired most of the property. JC Penney owns part of the mall property, while Centurion American Development Group owns the rest. Mehrdad Moayedi with Centurion American Development Group said his company planned to close a sale with a third owner later this month, leaving the mall to two key ownership groups. Centurion's plans call for 2,300 apartments, 300 senior living units, 500 homes, a hotel, restaurants and shops. The plans include parks, two hiking trails and a one-and-a-half acre lagoon. "It's going to have a real feel of a village to it as you come in," Moayedi said. "You don't see many cars, they go underneath and park and people come up." Moayedi said this section of Plano near Highway 75 and Plano Parkway has been overlooked -- despite the job growth in Collin County -- with several corporate headquarters setting up in and near Plano. "I think the time is now for that area because of all the job creation," Moayedi said. "We are hoping the redevelopment of the mall itself will impact the surrounding property," said Plano's planning director Christina Day. "The health of the mall will bring traffic, and the draw of the additional patrons should have a positive economic impact throughout the corridor." Jim Cooper, president of the nearby Pittman Creek Estates HOA, said he and other HOAs surveyed home owners in the Dallas North Estates neighborhood and Canyon Creek in Richardson. Out of 129 responses, Cooper said 81.5 percent were in favor of the development. Others, said Cooper, were either neutral or opposed. Those in opposition expressed concerns about apartment density, overloading local schools with new students and traffic in the area. "We can't pretend to know all of the answers, we just think this is directionally correct," Shank said. "What we want is a prime property there," he added. "Nicely developed that will bring in some good tax revenue to support our base here and it only makes sense -- it's just going to a waste right now."<end_of_turn>

# Charges Upgraded Against Man in Strangling of Pregnant Stepmom

LAKE COUNTY, Fla. — Prosecutors have upgraded charges against a 21-year-old Lake County man accused of strangling his pregnant stepmom in a Eustis cemetery last month.

# Swedish Researchers Shorten MRI Scans to Nearly a Minute

MRI scanners rely on a large magnet and radio waves to record images of organs within the body while requiring the subjects to lay still during the procedure. The use of MRI scanners increased dramatically between 1993 and 2004. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, there were less than 10 MRI scanners per million Americans in 1993. A traditional MRI scan requires different types of imaging. The procedure requires the patient to be still for about seven minutes for each image, with the entire process taking about 30 minutes to an hour. With EPI-mix technology, the scientists created a method to cut down the time to complete a full MRI scan to 70 seconds. Last year, Skare and his team released a video of 30 volunteers getting scanned in less than an hour.  Although the results are slightly unclear when compared to full-fledged MRI scans, they can be utilized by doctors for early detection and diagnosis, said Anna Falk Delgado, a radiology expert.<end_of_turn>

# Some residents say they are still locked out 6 weeks after Sausalito mudslide

SAUSALITO, Calif. (KGO) -- In mid-February, a mudslide moved houses and buried cars in Sausalito. A woman was inside one house that slid down a hill into another house.      She survived with minor injuries, but there are other victims, as well.      RELATED: Sausalito grandmother shares story of survival following mudslide      Monday, the street reopened but that has been little help to some former residents.      It's a nice view from his apartment deck in Tiburon, and he's not exactly a hardship case, but Bryan Wilson, formerly of Sausalito, still misses his old home.      "Do you think about it, much?" we asked.        "Every day."      Bryan used to live in the last red-tagged home following Sausalito's Valentines Day mudslide. It took out the house next door and pulled away his carport, essentially cut the family off from most of their belongings.      412 and 414 Sausalito Blvd might as well be an island surrounded by air now.      Caryn Sachs lived in the top unit.      RELATED: Sausalito landslide victims return home to retrieve personal items      "All my belongings and furniture are in there." Now, she's renting a houseboat. "I like the boat, and would like it better with my stuff."        Five days after the slide, Caryn, Bryan, and his wife did gain brief entry to the house. They pulled out whatever they could fit through a window and carry up a gangplank. The rest remains inside. They're waiting for guidance from the city.      "We are being as deliberate as we need to be to get as much reimbursement from the state and feds as possible," said Andrew Davidson, the senior engineer for Sausalito Public Works.      "We're the only house red-tagged?" asked Bryan.  "We cannot get our stuff until debris removal happens, rebuilding of the hill happens, and the rebuilding of the carport."      "There has been a lack of coordinated communication," said Caryn.      Sausalito estimates the debris field will remain until late summer, at least. It includes eight cars.      One of them belongs to Bryan Williams, who at least managed to get his personalized plates back. It's a small victory. The plate reads,  'Wilsn22.'      RELATED: Drone video shows aftermath of Sausalito mudslide      "What is 22?" we asked.        "22 is my lucky number."      "Still?"      "That's debatable," he said.      As to how Bryan recovered the plate, he is not saying. Nor is the National Park Service talking. It owns the land that slid.      ABC7 News reached out again on Monday, but received no response.

# Stylish Cafeteria From Dean & DeLuca Opens in the Meatpacking District

Headliner Dean & DeLuca Stage This new cafeteria restaurant from Dean & DeLuca, on the street level of the former Spice Market building, has been under development for nearly three years. Sorapoj Techakraisri, who expanded the company’s presence into Asia and the Middle East, is spearheading the venture. (His Pace Development, based in Bangkok, bought Dean & DeLuca four years ago.) This latest restaurant fills a brick-walled space. Up half a flight of stairs, there’s a white-marble and stainless-steel kitchen and serving island. “It’s the stage in the middle,” Mr. Techakraisri said. Along one side of the island, the kitchen prepares sandwiches by day, and dinner entrees in the evening. All feature a choice of beef, turkey, salmon, pork or falafel. The food is high quality and well prepared, though the entrees could use better presentation than a cardboard tub. On the opposite side of the “stage” is a coffee bar and an area with pastries that becomes a wine and cheese bar in the evening. Tables line the perimeter of the space; there is no waiter service. Another location is to open in Midtown this summer. (Opens Wednesday) 29 Ninth Avenue (13th Street), 646-448-4300, deandeluca.com/stage. Opening BigA Among the countless types of pizza served in New York, here is, yes, a new one: extra crunchy. Giovanni Barbieri, who is from the Veneto region in northeastern Italy, said that pizza with a crisp, yet airy crust is the style of the moment there, and that it’s becoming popular across the country. He has brought the style to the Lower East Side, in a bright, rustic corner restaurant with an open kitchen and a name that plays on his ingredients: He uses a yeast-based starter in his dough called biga. Unlike sourdough, biga is made fresh daily and results in a crust that’s crackling thin on the outside but extremely light inside. Mr. Barbieri uses an electric oven for consistency, and the dough winds up as plate-size rounds, large ovals and panini-style sandwiches. There are also whole-grain crusts, a few antipasti and salads. 1 Clinton Street (East Houston Street), 917-265-8453, biganyc.com. Lucky Lee’s Americanized Chinese food is nothing new, but, at this casual spot, the idea is trendy “wellness,” not chow mein and egg rolls. So you have gluten-free dumplings and lo mein, honey-glazed ribs tinted with beet juice, and vegan kung pao mushrooms and orange cauliflower. The oil is usually grapeseed; the chickens are pasture-raised; the beef is grass-fed, and no peanuts are used. (Monday) 67 University Place (10th Street), luckyleesnyc.com. Masala Mix Traditional Indian fare including samosas, rogan josh, biryani, chana masala and chicken curry will be on the menu at this newcomer from two experienced restaurateurs, Ravinder Kumar and Salim Rahman. Mr. Kumar is the chef. Next month, this intimate spot will add garden seating. 396 Fifth Avenue (Sixth Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn, 347-799-1614, masalamixnyc.com. The Poni Room Adding to the dining options at Saxon & Parole, AvroKO Hopsitality Group’s NoHo restaurant, there is an underground seafood den specializing in rosé wines. The chefs, Brad Farmerie and Nicole Gajadhar, are serving uni toasts, coconut laksa and skewered scallops, along with crispy wings. About 20 rosés are poured, as are cocktails. 316 Bowery (Bleecker Street), 212-254-0350, theponiroom.com. Windrose In the former Mas space in the West Village, this restaurant, with Sung Park as executive chef, opened briefly during a trial run last fall. It closed while awaiting a liquor license that has finally come through. (Friday) 39 Downing Street (Bedford Street), windroseny.com. 519 Broome Tatjana and David Berkowitsch, mother-and-son restaurateurs from Russia, have opened this SoHo spot with a menu of Eastern European dishes that sometimes strays into the Mediterranean. Dumplings come filled with mushrooms or potatoes and onions. There’s also baked salmon and mussels with tomatoes, basil and feta cheese. The chef, Artiom Pugacenco, is from Moldova. 519 Broome Street (Thompson Street), 212-226-8683, 519broome.com. Llamita After having closed for a few months, Erik Ramirez’s Peruvian luncheonette has been reconfigured as a full-service restaurant, still Peruvian, with him in the kitchen. 80 Carmine Street (Seventh Avenue South), 646-590-2770, llamitanyc.com. Le Succulent The chef Mélanie Delcourt has opened this French bistro, with a typical menu of quiche, salmon rillettes and beef bourguignon. 291 Fifth Avenue (Second Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn, 347-227-8282, lesucculent.com. Closing Maysville This place for bourbon, beef and beyond will close its doors after brunch on April 21. 17 West 26th Street (Broadway), 646-490-8240, maysvillenyc.com. Chefs on the Move Riccardo Orfino The executive sous-chef at La Pecora Bianca’s two locations in Manhattan has left to be the executive chef at Osteria 57, a West Village restaurant that features vegan, vegetarian and seafood dishes. Chikara Sono Mr. Sono, the head chef at Kyo Ya in the East Village, has left. He plans to open his own restaurant. Looking Ahead La Goulue The much-loved French restaurant and celebrity haunt that reopened a little over a year ago on the Upper East Side after an eight-year hiatus, will open a branch in Palm Beach, Fla., in October. Jean Denoyer, an owner, will deliver the same menu of bistro classics, with a few additions, and, one might suppose, many of the same chic names at the tables. It will also have a spacious private party room. 288 South County Road (Royal Palm Way), Palm Beach, Fla.<end_of_turn>

# Charges now filed in JCMO thefts and police chase - KWOS

We know the names now of the five Columbia natives accused of stealing from a Jefferson City store then driving away from the cops. Prosecutors have accused Laronya Brown, Emeisha Dorema, Tashianna Pitts, Antanesha Jones, and Reginald Guy with stealing and resisting arrest. Police say the suspects stole more than three thousand dollars worth of clothes from the Dick’s Sporting Goods at the capital on Sunday. They then allegedly drove away from the cops, and it took spike strips to stop them on Highway 63 near Ashland.  Charges now filed in JCMO thefts and police chase  04-02-2019<end_of_turn>

# Sall starts second Senegal term with 'constructive' dialogue pledge

Sall starts second Senegal term with 'constructive' dialogue pledge  DIAMNIADIO, Senegal (AFP) — Macky Sall on Tuesday embarked on his second term as Senegal's president pledging “constructive” dialogue with the opposition and reforms to spur development. Sall urged optimism as “it seems new economic perspectives are opening up for our country,” a reference to Senegal's plans to enter the hydrocarbons sector in 2021-22 via two ambitious oil and gas developments.  Clad in a navy blue suit, the trained geologist swore “before God and before the nation” to serve the people as several visiting African leaders looked on.  Also present was Mark Green, administrator of the US development agency USAID.  Sall, 57 and a self-declared “social liberal”, chose the new city of Diamniadio, some 32 kilometres (20 miles) from Dakar a product of his Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE) launched in 2014, to make his address.  “In vesting their confidence in you once again your fellow citizens have validated your record and backed your social project, to say the least,” said Constitutional Court president Pape Oumar Sakho.  Sall garnered a 58 per cent vote share, well clear of former prime minister Idrissa Seck on 20 per cent, with the rest of the pack left trailing to win easily in a single round on February 24.     NOD TO YOUTH, WOMEN  Helping to clear Sall's path to victory was the authorities' invalidation of several opposition candidacies including those of Karim Wade, the son of presidential predecessor Abdoulaye Wade (2000-12), as well as popular Dakar mayor Khalifa Sall.  Both were disqualified over convictions for misuse of public funds.  The election sidelined the Socialist Party and the Senegalese Democratic Party which have dominated politics since independence from France in 1960.  Although the disqualifications outraged the opposition, Sall insisted he would rule “for all Senegalese, hence “I renew my call for... a constructive dialogue open to all political, economic and social forces.”  The opposition has so far shown no sign of wanting to grasp any olive branch Sall might extend since he was officially proclaimed as poll winner on March 5.  Sall, who left the ceremony for the presidential palace in an open-topped saloon with his wife, also said he would particularly look to aid the young, pursuing employment and training policies promoting “the entrepreneurial spirit and new technologies”.  He added he would commit to “public policies favouring women and girls”, ensure “decent housing” for all and “safeguard the environment”.

# ‘Downton Abbey’ Movie Will Center on Royal Family Visit

The big-screen version of “Downton Abbey” will center on a royal visit.  In a new trailer that debuted at CinemaCon, the Crawley family and their army of maids, butlers, cooks, and assorted domestics are thrown into disarray by the impending arrival of King George V and Queen Mary. The year is 1927 and the Crawleys are tightening the old, bespoke belt, making day with slightly fewer servants. In order to get things in ship-shape, they ask the retired head butler Carson to return to the estate.  The trailer has all the upper class real estate porn that made the TV show so addictive. There are plenty of shots of well-appointed lawns, meticulously outfitted drawing rooms, grandfather clocks being wound, and crystal wine glasses being arranged. The tagline: “We’ve been expecting you.”  But times have changed. The Depression looms, a World War has ended. Lady Mary Crawley is toying with leaving the estate for a new life. Anna Bates, Lady Mary’s loyal maid, reminds her of the role that Downton plays in the small English village.   “Downton Abbey is the heart of this community and you’re keeping it beating,” she reminds Mary.  The Focus Features release brings back the Emmy-winning cast of the popular television series, including Maggie Smith, Elizabeth McGovern, Michelle Dockery, Penelope Wilton, and Hugh Bonneville. The film from director Michael Engler hits theaters on Sept. 20.<end_of_turn>

# MONEY MARKETS-U.S. federal funds rate stays at 2.41%

NEW YORK, April 3 (Reuters) - The average borrowing cost for U.S. banks to borrow excess reserves overnight held steady on Tuesday, as banks ramped up lending to each other in the beginning of the second quarter, New York Federal Reserve data released on Wednesday showed. The average or “effective” federal funds rate was unchanged from Monday at 2.41%. Its premium above what the U.S. central bank pays on the excess reserves remained at 1 basis point.

# Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen has a plan to avoid heart problems in Denver

LOS ANGELES — Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen has a smartphone application that helps monitor his heart rate. When he flies to Denver on Thursday with his wife Gianni, separately from the rest of the team, he’ll be checking the app closely. He will continue to take the blood pressure medication he’s taken the last nine years. He’ll avoid high-sodium foods. He will chug a one-liter jug of water five or six times a day like he always does – no more, certainly no less. “Trust me,” Jansen said, “I’m peeing a lot already. I don’t need to pee anymore.”  This is how the 31-year-old pitcher plans to avoid a recurrence of the irregular heartbeat that sent him to a Colorado hospital last August and eventually led him to undergo an ablation procedure in November. Jansen was hospitalized on Aug. 9, 2018, the first day of a four-game series in Denver. He flew back to Los Angeles the next day and didn’t pitch again until Aug. 20. Jansen’s would-be replacements went 1 for 5 in save opportunities in the meantime; the team went 4-6 and fell from first place in the National League West to third. When Jansen returned, it took him five appearances before he could complete an inning without allowing a run. That was the third time Jansen has experienced an atrial fibrillation episode during a trip to Denver. The “Mile High City” sits at a higher elevation than any major league ballpark, and altitude-related complications are common. Needless to say, Jansen and the Dodgers are motivated to avoid another incident. “It’s still a little nerve-wracking because it’s in the back of your mind somewhere,” Jansen said. “But you’ve just got to go and stay positive.” In theory, the ablation procedure should have reduced if not eliminated any risk. During the procedure, a catheter is passed to the heart and radiofrequency energy is used to destroy a small area of tissue causing an irregular heartbeat. Jansen had a similar procedure after the 2012 season. Dr. Koonlawee Nademanee, the cardiologist who performed both procedures, urged Jansen to visit Colorado in the offseason to test his heart at elevation. Jansen declined. “I wanted to spend Christmas and all the good holidays, all that good stuff, with your close ones,” he said. “I know I’m going to be (in Colorado) anyway.” Jansen said he’ll use Thursday as a day of no physical activity. A pregame cardio workout is planned for Friday, “make sure you get your heart elevated and see how it goes,” he said. If it doesn’t go well, Manager Dave Roberts has a contingency plan in place. “As long as he feels good we’re going to run him out there,” Roberts said. “If something unforeseen does happen, guys have got to step up. We acquired Joe (Kelly) to be able to finish games if we need to. His first couple outings haven’t been ideal, but he’s a guy that we’re going to lean on. You do have to prepare for sometimes the unplanned-for situation, but we’ll be ready.” KERSHAW UPDATE  Clayton Kershaw is targeting four innings and 60 pitches during his rehabilitation start for Triple-A Oklahoma City on Thursday, Roberts said. Depending on his efficiency, Kershaw might throw another inning in the bullpen afterward. And then? “It’s all contingent upon (Thursday) but we’re more leaning toward having two rehab starts,” Roberts said. “That’s kind of where we’re at now. The world changes every day but that’s kind of our plan.” Kershaw was sidelined by shoulder inflammation early in spring training. The left-hander received a cortisone injection and could not recover in time to extend his streak of consecutive Opening Day starts to nine. The rehab start will be his first outing outside of an intrasquad simulated game. ALSO  Rich Hill (sprained left knee) threw from flat ground and remains on track to pitch off a mound Saturday in Denver. Afterward, the left-hander reported improvement when throwing from a slide step, a source of impingement earlier in the week. … The probable pitchers for the three-game series in Denver: right-hander Kenta Maeda will oppose left-hander Tyler Anderson on Friday; right-hander Walker Buehler will oppose right-hander Jon Gray on Saturday; left-hander Julio Urías will oppose right-hander Chad Bettis on Sunday. … Sunday’s game (5:30 p.m. PT) will be broadcast by ESPN and will not be blacked out in Southern California.<end_of_turn>

# Join the second annual Greening Salt Spring campaign

Join the second annual Greening Salt Spring campaign  The last of Salt Spring’s brutal winter’s snow has finally disappeared from the roadsides and ditches, revealing all the trash that has accumulated over the winter months.  We’re hoping islanders will once again join the Driftwood and our Streets of Salt Spring columnist DW Salty in heading out on island roads, streets, pathways and beaches to rid them of garbage and recyclables.  Last year’s inaugural Greening Salt Spring campaign had such a big impact that the Driftwood is spearheading the effort again in 2019. We invite individuals, families and groups to commit to cleaning up a section of the island between now and Earth Day, which is April 22.  We’d love to be able to acknowledge everyone who does their part, no matter how small, so ask that you send an email to the Driftwood’s “green queen” Elizabeth Nolan at enolan@gulfislandsdriftwood.com with your name and what area of the island you plan to clean up. You can also call her at 250-537-9933, respond to our Facebook post asking for volunteers or drop in to the office at 328 Lower Ganges Rd. to share your info in person.  New this year for people signing up is free garbage disposal provided by Laurie’s Recycling and Waste Services. People committing to clean up a particular section of road or street will be given a Driftwood-created tag to identify themselves as a Greening Salt Spring participant when they drop off the garbage they have collected.  Thank you to Nancy and Laurie Hedger for offering this service. It was their idea!  We are also hoping to give clean-up participants the option to donate funds from the recyclables they pick up to a green island charity. More details will be provided once we have them. As well, stay tuned for more info about an Earth Day Ganges clean-up blitz organized by the Chamber of Commerce.  Having spent a few hours cleaning part of my neighbourhood road last year, I have a couple of tips to share. For managing the multitudinous small items — like candy bar and soya sauce wrappers and cigarette butts — it’s useful to carry a small bag to pop them into. Larger garbage bags can carry the recyclables. You don’t want to mix the true trash and the recycling in one bag. Yuck!  Bigger stuff like car parts might best be dealt with separately so your bag doesn’t get too heavy and break.  Footwear is also a consideration. Even if it’s sunny when I head out this year I will be wearing my gumboots. Last year my hiking shoes got wet and grossly muddy when I had no choice but to hit the ditches to reach some of the trash.  This goes without saying, I’m sure, but don’t forget your gloves!<end_of_turn>

# Joker trailer: first footage of Batman spin-off released

The trailer for the hotly anticipated Batman spinoff Joker has hit the internet.  Starring Joaquin Phoenix in a role already played by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, Joker has been conceived as a standalone film separate from the DEC Extended Universe series.  Set in 1981, and describing the Joker as “a failed stand-up comedian, disregarded by his society, [who] turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham City, this origins story is purportedly influenced by gritty urban films of the Martin Scorsese vintage – so much so that at one point Scorsese was attached as co-producer to the project.  Directed by Todd Phillips, Joker is due for release on 3 October in Australia, and 4 October in the US and UK.<end_of_turn>

# Love Island Jack Fincham confirms split from Dani Dyer AGAIN

Love Island couple Jack Fincham and Dani Dyer have split once again.  The news was confirmed by Jack in an Instagram story.  In an emotional statement, he said: "There is no easy way to say this and it isn't going to be an easy time but me and Dani are not in a relationship anymore.  "We will always care a lot for each other and have love for each other and I mean that from the bottom of my heart and I wish her nothing but happiness."  He continued: ""We have some amazing memories together and have been through a lot but sometimes things aren't meant to be and we really did try to make it work, but unfortunately it didn't and that is life.  "That's all I have to say, a break-up is heard enough as it is for both of us let alone in the public eye, so I hope everyone is considerate and understands this."  Dani has not yet released an official statement.  In December 2018, the golden couple who seemed perfect for each other announced they had parted.  However, a few days later the pair reconciled with Dani's dad Danny Dyer insisting: “I just want to put something to bed. She hasn’t split up with Jack, that’s all b******s, that is.”<end_of_turn>

# Bolton given extra time to settle debts, avoid liquidation

LONDON — Bolton, one of English soccer’s oldest clubs, has been given an extra five weeks to settle its debts and avoid going out of business.  Lawyers for the northwest team were in the High Court in London on Wednesday over an unpaid tax bill of 1.2 million pounds ($1.6 million). The case was adjourned until May 8 to allow time for the club to be sold, which would lead to the debts being cleared.  It is the sixth time in the last 18 months that Bolton, one of the founding members of England’s Football League in 1888, has been threatened with liquidation by tax authorities.  Players are currently on strike in support of staff whose wages were not paid on time for the second straight month and the team is facing relegation from the second-tier League Championship. It is in next-to-last place, five points from safety with seven games left this season.  Bolton’s lawyer, Hilary Stonefrost, told the court that the club’s potential buyer, Laurence Bassini, has proof of funds to complete the purchase. Bassini is the former chairman of English team Watford and was banned from holding a position of authority at an English club for three years in 2013 for alleged financial misconduct.  Bolton was most recently in the Premier League in 2012.  ___  More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports  Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

# Bozeman coffee shop named number 1 in state

BOZEMAN – The list is in and Bozeman holds the number one spot for best cup of coffee in our state! Food & Wine Magazine released its annual list of the best coffee in every state and found a gem in the treasure state by way of a woman-owned roaster in Bozeman who took home the gold for Montana. The magazine says Treeline Coffee opened in 2016, but already feels like a “Bozeman fixture.” Treeline’s coffee menu includes an array of single-origin beans from around the globe along with organic treats. Food & Wine praises Treeline’s owners, Natalie Van Dusen and Deejay Newell, for making women-owned companies part of their mission. Treeline has two locations in Bozeman and has poured many cups of coffee since opening in 2016. One thing is very clear, it’s a great meeting place. Every table and seat were full with people have conversation and drinking coffee. Treeline’s offerings include single-varietal coffee beans grown by women farmers in the small African country of Burundi. We here at Wake Up Montana are fueled by coffee and want to say a big congratulations to the roasters over at Teeline.<end_of_turn>

# Rising fuel prices hit Lancashire drivers hard

Fuel prices in the north west have risen by more than 7p in just one year, according to new figures, with drivers in the Ribble Valley and Pendle the worst hit.  According to the new figures, diesel drivers are bearing the brunt of the increases, as the average cost per litre has increased to 130.1p – up a whopping 7.6p year-on-year. This is equivalent to £74 to fill up a medium-sized car. Similarly, petrol prices across the North West are increasing, with the cost of petrol now at 120.6p, on average – 1.2p more expensive than 12 months ago. This means the average price of filling a medium-sized tank could cost drivers £69. While both petrol and diesel costs have gone up, the gap between the two has widened dramatically over the last 12 months. There is now a 9.5p difference in the cost per litre, compared to only 3.1p this time last year. This equates to a £5 difference in the price of filling a medium-sized tank of petrol and diesel, compared to £2 12 months ago. According to Confused.com’s fuel price index, petrol drivers in Ribble Valley might be groaning on their next trip to the fuel station, as the area saw the steepest increase in prices, which are now 1.8p more expensive than one week ago – with the average price per litre now costing 121.7p. And diesel prices in Pendle have increased at the fastest rate, climbing by 1.3p in one week to 130p per litre, on average. It is a similar picture across the UK, as the average price of fuel reaches its highest yet in 2019, following months of consecutive increases. According to the data, the current price of petrol climbed to 122p per litre, on average – an 0.8p increase week-on-week – and diesel reached 130.6p – up 0.2p in the same period. March saw the first month-on-month increase since October 2018. The cost of fuel increased by 1p on average, with diesel climbing to 130p per litre and petrol to 121p. These increasing fuel prices seems to be having a serious effect on UK motorists. Almost one in three (32 per cent) say it’s making it less affordable to run a car. And more than half (54 per cent) have noticed they get fewer miles for their money. The average amount spent per trip to the pumps costs motorists £32, on average. This is not enough to fill a small car (42L), which costs £51 for petrol and £55 for diesel, on average. With this in mind, one in eight (12 per cent) UK drivers admit they can’t afford to fill up their car regularly. And more than a third (36 per cent) are calling for fuel to be made more affordable. Meanwhile, many motorists would be willing to ditch petrol and diesel altogether in order to cut back on their fuel spending. Almost half (49 per cent) would buy an electric vehicle (EV) for their next car. However, of the remaining 51 per cent who wouldn’t, 61 per cent say the hefty price tag of an EV still puts them off, while 60% bemoan a lack of charging points. Amanda Stretton, motoring editor at Confused.com, says: “Fuel prices across the North West are increasing and showing little sign of slowing down. And this is the same for the rest of the UK. Just when we thought we were out of the woods - fuel prices start to go up again. No wonder drivers are confused. It’s typical that this is happening at a time when the UK is about to enter economic uncertainty. “But in the long run, motorists should be doing all they can to save on fuel costs.”<end_of_turn>

# Sure, air pollution's a problem. So, what should we do about it?

A report telling us that large areas of the world suffer from air pollution. The thing being, well, what should we do about this? The life expectancy of children born today will be shortened by 20 months on average by breathing the toxic air that is widespread across the globe, with the greatest toll in south Asia, according to a major study. Air pollution contributed to nearly one in every 10 deaths in 2017, making it a bigger killer than malaria and road accidents and comparable to smoking, according to the State of Global Air (SOGA) 2019 study published on Wednesday. Perhaps the first thing is to understand what the report is actually telling us. For example, the highest exposure over a large area to the PMI stuff - the little bits that get stuck in the lungs - is in and around the Sahara. As the report notes - give them credit - this is sand and there’s not a great deal that can really be done about that. More generally it ‘s the indoor use of solid cooking fuels (this is what they measure, agreeing that solid fuel heating will increase the damage) which produces great exposure for near half the world’s population. Next up is the clouds and smogs of an industrial revolution under way. The rich countries have, obviously enough, pollution problems but they’re of a different and lesser kind. That is, we’ve the environmental Kuznets Curve here. Pollution changes as development occurs. That internal to the home decreases first even as the factories start to belch. Once interesting amounts of income are being widely shared - for which they’ve got to be created first - then pollution declines, significantly. London’s economy is, after all, far larger than it was in 1955 and we’ve not had a killer smog since. The report itself is here. The correct takeaway being that economic development cleans up the air, as it cleans up so many other things. So, what do we do? We argue for more hell for leather economic development so that the currently poor places can quickly reach that same clean and pure air (if you prefer, cleaner and purer) we in the already rich places enjoy. Yea, even though there is that bolus of industrial pollution during the process this is more than offset by the reduction in domestic at the same time.<end_of_turn>

# Vreed-en-Hoop man robbed at knife-point

A Vreed-en-Hoop, Best, West Coast Demerara (WCD) man is now calling on the relevant authorities to set up surveillance in the area after he was recently attacked and robbed at knife-point by a lone bandit.  According to the man, for the past two weeks, several similar robberies have been occurring in the area specifically at Kitram and Papi Streets as well as the Crane areas.  The victim relayed to Inews that he had just exited a minibus and was walking along Kitram Street at around 21:00hrs when he was attacked.  The lone suspect reportedly rode up on a bicycle and held him from behind at knife-point, demanding that he hand over his valuables.  As such, the frightened man handed over his cellphone and a bag containing some $5000 and other articles.  The matter was reported to the Police but a suspect is yet to be charged.  However, since that robbery, the victim is alleging that ten other persons were robbed in similar fashion but this time by bandits on a CG motorcycle.  Reports are that two men, clad in camouflage clothing would commit the act between 21:00 and 02:00hrs.  A string of break and enter has also been reported in some of the areas.  As such, the victim is calling for the matters to be properly investigated as several times when reports were made at the Police Station, ranks fail to respond, citing that no vehicles are available.<end_of_turn>

# Edmonton author signs $1.3M book deal in Africa | CBC News

Edmonton author signs $1.3M book deal in Africa Lawrence Muganga's book You Can’t Make "Fish Climb Trees" calls for new approach to teaching African students When Lawrence Muganga was nine-years-old, he asked his mom for money to buy a male and female rabbit to breed so he could afford to go back to school in central Uganda. His plan worked. It worked so well that one year and 300 rabbits later, Muganga offered some animals to his school to help fund other kids who couldn't afford school fees. Unfortunately, Muganga's teacher didn't share his enthusiasm. Instead, the teacher convinced Muganga's parents that the business easing their financial hardship was a distraction. Muganga was suspended and his rabbit farm was shut down. "It showed me that the education system is more theoretical than practical," said Muganga, now 43, an author and policy advisor who moved to Edmonton in 2011 to complete his PhD in education at the University of Alberta. "This gave me the opportunity to make my contribution towards correcting a system of education that is not actually helping students to achieve their full potential. Their inner natural abilities are not being nurtured, are not being brought out by the education system." Nearly four decades later, it's an experience that helped inform Muganga's new book You Can't Make "Fish Climb Trees", which has just clinched a $1.3 million book deal with an international organization. The contract prevents the organization from being named. The book calls for a new approach to teaching students in sub-Saharan Africa, which according to Muganga hasn't changed that much since his childhood lessons, sitting under a mango tree. Muganga advocates for a shift that moves away from theoretical learning, such as lessons in geography and history of far-off places, to realistic learning that equips students with work skills they can use. He pointed to an example in his own family in Uganda — two nephews who graduated university are unemployed while their brother, who became an electrician, owns his own business and employs 117 people. 'Authentic learning' "[The book] is recommending something I call authentic learning that allows the students to produce a tangible outcome or product that they can share with their world, their world being their communities," said Muganga. He said the model of "authentic learning" was first coined by Ontario-based educator Steve Revington. At the same time, Muganga said, it's important to teach students soft skills such as communication, collaboration and problem-solving. The change will help tackle high rates of youth unemployment and reduce an over-reliance on foreign expertise, companies and imports, he said. "Africa is not poor but the approaches to developing its human capital is where they have gotten it wrong," he said. The book deal allows for the free distribution of You Can't "Make Fish Climb Trees" in universities and schools in Africa but that's not the only boon. The money will be used to build a school in Kampala, Uganda based on the model of authentic learning. Muganga expects the project will break ground in September. "Other schools could come and learn from this school; to see what is being done and implement it in the various schools," Muganga said. Inspired by his mom Muganga's own passion for learning was largely inspired by his mother. With a Grade 2 education, she wanted a better life for her children after the family fled conflict and persecution in Rwanda in the 1950s. Weekdays began at 3 a.m. to give Muganga enough time to make the 10-kilometre trek to school which sometimes involved swimming across a river when the bridge washed away in the rainy season. Through his academic success and soccer skills, Muganga managed to secure the tuition that allowed him to complete high school and earn a scholarship to Makerere University in Kampala. Through another scholarship from the World Bank, Muganga completed his master's degree in economic policy. In between, he returned to Rwanda, where he eventually oversaw a capacity-building program for the entire country. Last September, Muganga completed his PhD in education administration and leadership at the University of Alberta. His emphasis on authentic learning is reflected in the way he and his wife are raising their own six children including a daughter named class valedictorian, another one who just made lead in the school play and two children enrolled in cadets. "I try to understand their strengths," said Muganga. "They are totally different characters. So when I understand that, I am trying to raise them with the passion they have, with their natural abilities, and support them that way."<end_of_turn>

# European Shares Little Changed Ahead Of US Jobs Report

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European stocks were moving in a narrow range on Friday, as investors kept an eye on ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations and awaited the release of the U.S. non-farm payrolls report for March later in the day. U.S. employment is expected to jump by 180,000 jobs in March after inching up by just 20,000 jobs in February. The unemployment rate is expected to hold at 3.8 percent. Meanwhile, media reports suggest that that European Council President Donald Tusk is considering to provide a one-year 'flexible' extension for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Tusk's proposal would enable the U.K. to quit the bloc earlier, if Parliament ratifies the withdrawal agreement before the 12-month period. The plan has to be agreed by EU leaders at a summit next week. The pan European Stoxx 600 was marginally lower at 387.81 in opening deals after declining 0.3 percent in the previous session. The German DAX was trading flat with a negative bias, while France's CAC 40 index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 were up slightly. Commerzbank rallied 1.8 percent while Deutsche Bank edged down slightly after recent reports of a possible merger between them. Swiss producer and supplier of polymers and chemicals Ems Chemie jumped 4.6 percent after its Q1 net sales beat target. Miners Anglo American, Antofagasta and Glencore all rose about 1 percent on hopes for a possible U.S.-China trade deal, while oil giant BP Plc gained 0.7 percent and Tullow Oil added 1.1 percent. In economic releases, Germany's industrial production grew a price, seasonally and calendar adjusted 0.7 percent in February, slightly slower than the 0.8 percent gain economists had predicted, preliminary figures from the Federal Statistical Office showed. France's merchandise trade deficit narrowed in February after widening at the start of the year. A gauge of U.K. house price inflation rose to 3.2 percent in March from 2.8 percent in February. Economists had expected a lower rate of 2.1 percent. Copyright RTT News/dpa-AFX<end_of_turn>

# Cars worth £34,000 stolen from Suffolk dealer

Cars worth £34,000 stolen from Suffolk dealer  PUBLISHED: 16:34 05 April 2019 | UPDATED: 16:34 05 April 2019  Archant  Three cars worth more than £30,000 have been stolen from a family car dealership in Suffolk in a night-time robbery.  A white BMW M140i worth £21,000, a black Ford Focus worth £6,750 and a white Ford Focus worth £6,250 were all stolen from Simon Shield Cars in Lower Farm Road, Great Bricett, near Wattisham, overnight. The robbers forced entry to the garage through a back door before rifling through drawers and cabinets. A key cabinet was broken into and three sets of keys were stolen for the cars. The thefts happened between 7pm on Thursday, April 4 and 7.30am on Friday, April 5. Simon Shield, who owns the dealership said: “I was a bit stunned to be honest when I saw the cars had gone. “I got to work and noticed that two of the cars weren’t on the forecourt. I first thought that they had been taken to the garage but when I got closer I notice that the door had been forced open. “I went into the office and saw that they they had gone through all the drawers and the cabinets and took the three sets of keys for the cars before taking off. “I have been here for 23 years and I’ve never had anything like this. The shop is right next to the entrance to Wattisham Airfield where they have 24 hour armed guards.” The stolen BMW was the most expensive car that was being sold at the dealership at the time of the theft and Mr Shield thinks that at least one of the cars may have been stolen to order. “I think that they might have been targeting the BMW but I don’t know why they took the two Fords when we also have Mercedes and Audi’s,” he said. “The police have been really helpful. “They have looked around the local estates and the country roads to see if they have been abandoned. “There has not been any personal damage to me, but for a small business like ours it is a really big hit to take. “We do have insurance but £34,000 is a lot to lose for a long period of time. “It is really damaging for our business.” A spokesperson from Suffolk Constabulary said said anyone with information or any witnesses is asked to call police on 101 quoting crime reference number 37/19217/19.<end_of_turn>

# Widower of subway-push victim calls killer ‘demented piece of garbage’

The widower of a woman who was fatally shoved in front of a subway train over two years ago blasted his wife’s admitted killer calling her a “psychopath” and a “demented piece of garbage” in court Friday before she was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.  Robert Watton made the statements at the sentencing of Melanie Liverpool, who pleaded guilty last month to shoving his wife, Connie Watton, in front of a southbound No. 1 train at the Times Square station on Nov. 7, 2016.  “I am haunted when imagining what happened to Connie that day by this demented piece of garbage, this murderer,” Watton spat while glaring at Liverpool in Manhattan Supreme Court. “The name Melanie means darkness. You are heartless and you have no soul…She is a danger to the public and I wish nothing but a life behind bars for this psychopath,” an impassioned Watton yelled.  Watton said his wife, 49 — a longtime housekeeper for billionaire Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman’s family — emigrated from the Philippines as a teen to make a better life for herself and to support her family back home.  “She is the love of my life for all eternity,” he said.  Justice Michael Obus handed down the harshest sentence he could under the terms of her plea deal.  “This is the quintessential urban nightmare when a total stranger takes it upon themselves to snuff out someone else’s life,” Obus said adding, “I do not believe that a lesser sentence would suffice.”  Liverpool’s lawyer, Aaron Wallenstein, argued for 15 years to life behind bars for his client noting that she was sexually abused when she was a child and suffered from mental illness.  “She pushed her in front of a train and ended her life and that can only be done by someone who didn’t know what they were doing,” Wallenstein said.  “There is no disputing that the loss of life Mrs. Connie Watton is nothing short of a tragedy,” Wallenstein added.  Last year, Robert sued the city’s Health and Hospitals Corp., which runs Bellevue Hospital, for releasing Liverpool despite the fact she had raved in the hospital about killing transit riders.<end_of_turn>

# 'Echo in the Canyon', A Documentary That Explores the Iconic Laurel Canyon Music Scene of 1965-1967

The upcoming documentary film Echo in the Canyon takes a look at Southern California’s Laurel Canyon during the seminal years of 1965-1967, a time and place where some of the most iconic American music of the time was created.  Musician Jakob Dylan sat down with a number of the musicians who were an integral part of that iconic scene during those years, including Eric Clapton, Stephen Stills, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Roger McGuinn, and Jackson Browne. Dylan also spoke with musicians who were profoundly influenced by this era such as Tom Petty (his final interview), Beck, Fiona Apple, Cat Power, Regina Spektor, and Norah Jones. The film scheduled to be released in theaters on May 24th, 2019.   Echo In The Canyon celebrates the explosion of popular music that came out of LA’s Laurel Canyon in the mid-60s as folk went electric and The Byrds, The Beach Boys, Buffalo Springfield and The Mamas and the Papas gave birth to the California Sound. …Featuring Jakob Dylan, the film explores the beginnings of the Laurel Canyon music scene. Dylan uncovers never-before-heard personal details behind the bands and their songs and how that music continues to inspire today. via Boing Boing<end_of_turn>

# Google surprises Android TV owners with unwanted advertisements

Updates that add features like additional HDR support or fix weird issues are one good thing about smart TVs, but as many of us have experienced, there can be a downside. Software updates delivered months or years after a TV is purchased could change the interface for the worse, or add "features" that are really just revenue-generating opportunities. A "pilot program" popping up on Android TVs (which include most of Sony's lineup from the past few years, even the expensive models) combines both of those issues by adding a row of Sponsored content that no one asked for.  That no one apparently includes Sony, which posted a new support page noting that the change is managed by Google. Even though owners of their TVs purchased displays without the ads and didn't anticipate they'd show up, there's no way to simply disable them -- instead Sony suggests creating a new Restricted profile that will only list the apps users opt into showing.<end_of_turn>

# Richmond native Williford key to UVA’s Final Four journey

MINNEAPOLIS, MN (WWBT) - Jason Williford fell just short of reaching the Final Four as a player for UVA. Now, he’s fulfilled his journey as an assistant coach.  “I’m a ’95 alum. I bleed it, so I know the history of the program,” Williford said. “It’s about dag-gone time we had some luck go our way.”  Williford, a Richmond native, helped lead the Cavaliers to the Elite Eight during his senior season. Now in his 10th year as an assistant coach to Tony Bennett, he’ll experience the biggest stage in college basketball for the first time.  “It’s bigger than anything I’ve ever seen before. Trust me,” Williford said. “An Elite Eight as a player, an Elite Eight now as a coach, and now a Final Four - it’s the first time for all of us.”  The John Marshall graduate says that the moment has not totally hit him yet. He's still in the mindset of preparing his team to play a game, and using the same focus he has all season. With that said, he's still taking some time to make sure he soaks it all in.  “It’s unreal. I’ve got a ton of pictures already in my phone. Just being out there for practice today was awesome. All the texts, all the calls, it’s big time.”  Williford has been key in Virginia's success this season. He works mostly with the forwards and centers and there's a common theme among the players when asked about their longtime assistant, and that's his energy.  “Every morning he’ll walk into breakfast or whatever, or at least on game days, and he’ll just start clapping. ‘Great day to be a Hoo,’ that sort of thing,” said Virginia sophomore forward Jay Huff. “At first we’re like ‘oh, gosh, it’s too early for that.’ But eventually we get used to it and we wake up.”  "He's a good trash talker," added junior forward Braxton Key. "His energy, his enthusiasm every single day in practice... he always yells 'great day to be a Hoo,' so just that enthusiasm, it's contagious."  Saturday will be another great day to be a Wahoo. With a win in the national semifinal over Auburn, Williford and the Cavaliers could write the greatest chapter in UVA basketball history.  "It'd mean the world," smiled Williford. "If we can do that, I mean, the story's an awesome story, but if we can do that and play in the title [game], we'll go down in history."  Virginia and Auburn tip off in the first semifinal on Saturday at 6:09pm ET, followed by Michigan State and Texas Tech.  Copyright 2019 WWBT. All rights reserved.<end_of_turn>

# Herrmann: Bring the Final Four back to its cozy roots

MINNEAPOLIS — They practice in comfortable gymnasiums. They play all year in arenas where the fans and noise are right on top of them. And then, in the absolute biggest games of their seasons and possibly their lives, college basketball teams play in a setting that is about as intimate as the Grand Canyon.  There is nothing quite like it anywhere else in American sports, this practice of the NCAA Tournament welcoming its Final Four by dropping them into a completely alien environment. It is amazing that players shoot as well as they do while facing into vast acres of air and spectators far, far away in the upper, upper decks.  Welcome back to stadium ball, which is, of course, a windfall for the NCAA and a huge potential pratfall for players who are trying to win a national championship.  “Definitely, a change of scenery causes that depth perception trouble and whatnot,” said Michigan State’s Kenny Goins, a fifth-year senior who redshirted in 2014-15 but was with the team when it went to the Final Four. “Really, it’s just getting out there and warming up and shooting. The practice we had here [Thursday] definitely helped. We weren’t allowed to have an actual practice before the game last time and I think it definitely affected us. But I think being able to get out there and put up as many shots as possible is probably the biggest thing.  “Once you’re in the swing of things, it all evens itself out,” Goins said. “But it’s those first couple of shots, you might end up hitting just backboard, thinking you’re a lot closer than you are.”  Texas Tech big man Tariq Owens, whose team faces Michigan State Saturday night before more than 70,000 at U.S. Bank Stadium, said: “The rim is the rim. You’ve got to trust the work that you put in. The depth perception is a little bit different but you’ve got to trust the work. It’s muscle memory. You can’t get consumed by how much space is around you, how many people are in the gym. You’ve got to believe in what you can do.”  Some teams do that better than others. The 2016 Villanova Wildcats were not the least flustered by NRG Stadium in Houston. They shot .714 from the floor in their semifinal against Oklahoma and .583 in their championship game win over North Carolina. But at the same huge venue five years earlier, Connecticut won the title by shooting a mere .345 because Butler shot .188.  It is something else with which everyone must deal. That’s the cost of the NCAA insisting on a Super Bowl atmosphere, which it has fostered since it last held the Final Four in a basketball arena (the Meadowlands) 23 years ago.  Kyle Guy of Virginia, which plays Auburn Saturday night, said on Friday, “As a shooter, obviously, you have to be confident in yourself and your teammates have to be confident in you. And with that confidence, it doesn’t matter where you’re shooting. You could be shooting at Rucker Park in Harlem or you could be shooting in a football stadium.” His coach, Tony Bennett, said, “The key is just to get good shots.”  The key for tournament organizers is to attract as many ticket- and souvenir-buyers as humanly possible. Fine. It’s nice that many people get to say they were at the Final Four (to say they actually saw it might be a stretch).  But it would be nice, at least once in a while, if they brought the Final Four to New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Greensboro or anywhere else that does not have the luxury of a monstrous dome. Bring it back to its true indoor roots.  The tournament wouldn’t be what it is without games in cozy settings such as Maryland’s Cole Field House (trailblazing Texas Western over Kentucky, 1966), Salt Lake City’s Special Events Center (Magic Johnson over Larry Bird, 1979) and Albuquerque New Mexico’s Pit (Jim Valvano’s desperate dash to find someone to hug).  It reminds me of a time I covered a matinee National League playoff game in St. Louis and the headline in the next day’s Post-Dispatch was, “Day Baseball: What’ll They Think of Next?”  How about this: A championship basketball game in a basketball arena.<end_of_turn>

# Red Bull chief admits Mercedes have 'made contact' with Max Verstappen over SHOCK switch

That is the claim of Red Bull boss Helmut Marko. Verstappen is under contract until the end of next season, after he signed a lucrative new deal last year. Despite this, it appears that Mercedes have been eyeing up the young phenom as a potential Silver Arrows driver in the future. Marko also confirmed that there is a ‘performance clause’ in the Dutchman’s contract, though it is not clear exactly what this clause entails. “There is certainly a performance clause in Max's contract,” Marko told AutoBild. “Toto Wolff regularly calls him and his father, Jos. "I am relaxed about it. “He feels good with us and if we give him world championship material, I will not worry that he will stay." Verstappen is viewed by many as a future world champion, and is the youngest ever Grand Prix winner, after he won the Spanish Grand Prix aged just 18. With rival teams circling the youngster, Red Bull face a tough fight to keep their star. Last year, they made the move to switch their Renault engine for a more reliable Honda model. This came after Verstappen was forced to retire from three Grand Prix last year, with then-team-mate Daniel Ricciardo retiring from eight. But this year hasn’t started too well for the youngster, as he went from a podium finish in Australia to fourth in Bahrain, after suffering car issues. Marko expects the Red Bull car will improve and that Verstappen just needs to give it time. “There will be no new car,” he continued. “We have an aerodynamic problem, that is in the chassis. The solution is not a matter of doing it in a week. The first package is coming in China next week. “Only in Spain will the necessary aerodynamic adjustment be made.”<end_of_turn>

# Steps forward for rail trail: Consultants outline planning stage

ST. ALBANS — Those who take advantage of the Missisquoi Valley Rail Trail may be thrilled to see the trail unveiled again as snow melts.  What even they might not know, however, is that the Northwest Regional Planning Commission and the Missisquoi Valley Rail Trail Council are launching a $100,000-plus effort to improve the trail, better market the trail and connect the trail to businesses in the communities the trail runs through.  The initiative’s planning stage is underway, led by the SE Group, the consulting firm soon to finish Enosburg Falls’ Vital Village project, a plan to similarly revitalize the village’s downtown.  SE Group representatives met with the MVRTC on March 18 to explain their approach to the project.  Drew Pollak-Bruce, an SE Group planner, said the group’s goal in planning the project is to “maximize the economic and tourism impact of the trail” through five means: branding, wayfinding, marketing and a “trail-friendly business” program, offering technical assistance and wayfinding to businesses situated near the trail.  Pollak-Bruce told the council he will serve as both the input-gatherer and communicator for the SE Group.  Liz Grades is also working on the project, an SE Group designer with a fine arts background.  So is Russ Roca, of website the Path Less Pedaled — pathlesspedaled.com — “inspiring bicycle travel through storytelling.”  Pollak-Bruce said the team will use Roca’s strong sense of “what bicyclists are looking for,” a sense Pollak-Bruce supported by noting Roca’s nearly 40,000 YouTube followers.  According to Pollak-Bruce, Roca has already offered preliminary suggestions like geocaching to attract students to the trail — for example, placing a unique emblem in each community through which the trail passes, which students could collect via rubbings.  MVRTC members shared their rail trail improvement wish list. Clearer signage. Restrooms. A stronger online presence. Attracting younger people to the trail made several council members’ wish list.  Others said they would like to publicly clarify exactly how far the trail extends, with one mentioning a reportedly common misconception that the trail extends into Canada. In fact, it covers just over 26 miles from St. Albans to Richford.  After noting the council’s comments, Pollak-Bruce walked the council through the six stages of the SE Group’s process.  First, “a thorough and objective assessment of MVRT’s potential to become a trail destination within the competitive marketplace,” based on trail traffic data, community and visitor demographics, trail amenities and “visitation potential,” the scale of “locals, destination visitors to the trail and regional visitors who may be looking for an additional activity to do during their stay in northern Vermont.”  Second, a three-day trail ride and audit. The SE Group and the Path Less Pedaled will ride the trail for two days to gauge existing wayfinding and general trail conditions, and the ease of finding businesses, services and amenities.  During that ride, Roca plans to capture a video tour of the trail for his YouTube channel — remember the 38,000 followers — “to highlight the user experience and bring attention to the trail.”  On the third day, the SE Group plans to follow up with local business owners along the trail corridor and gather additional photos and videos for marketing.  The third step is the actual concept development — the SE Group designing the trail’s new visual brand, wayfinding system and marketing strategy.  Fourth is hosting a brand and trail business summit for residents, municipal representatives, chambers of commerce and local businesses, at which SE Group representatives will present analyses and preliminary concepts, then gather community input.  Creating a funding and implementation action plan, followed by a branding and identity guide, are respectively fifth and sixth on the SE Group’s list.  Pollak-Bruce said the project’s planning stage will continue through September, with implementation of the final plans scheduled for October through March 2020.  The initiative’s total cost is approximately $118,374.  The Northern Border Regional Commission awarded the NRPC and MVRTC federal grant funding covering 50 percent of that total cost. Local organizations were responsible for the remaining 50 percent, most of which came from the NRPC’s transportation planning initiative funds.  The MVRTC next meets in May.

# Apple Scammed For Nearly $900,000 By Chinese Nationals Living In Oregon, Washington

Knockoff iPhones have gotten so good that a pair of Chinese nationals were able to scam Apple out of nearly $900,000 in a counterfeiting scheme involving roughly 3,000 devices, according to federal prosecutors.  The two men - who were both engineering students in the US on F-1 student visas at the time - allegedly imported over 3,000 fake iPhones, which they would then claim were broken. Apple replaced 1,493 of the phones with warranty claims linked to Yangyang Zhou and Quan Jiang. The pair would then ship the genuine iPhones back to China where they would be resold for a profit.  According to the complaint, Jiang coordinated the iPhone shipments to different addresses in the US in order to evade Customs and Border Protection, while Jiang's mother allegedly collected his share of the profits in China - then deposited it in an account he was able to access. Jiang also paid friends to help with the fraud.  The 1,576 claims that were denied were rejected for tampering, however none of the phones were identified by Apple as counterfeit, according to the filing. As NPR notes, the successful claims suggests that Jiang and Zhou had access to authentic iPhone serial or International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers - which include information on the origin, model and serial number of the mobile device. The complaint does not state how the men obtained this information, while Apple has not clarified if it required either of the numbers before approving claims.  Hilariously, one of the warranty claims submitted in April 2018 was for a customer named "Apache Helicopter."   This fake (made-in-China) iPhone looks so good it almost fooled the Expertshttps://t.co/bJ4dx0znaE — BenTallmadge (@BenKTallmadge) April 6, 2019 Apple took losses of around $600 per phone for an overall estimated loss of $895,000, a company official told the Department of Homeland Security.   According to court documents Jiang laid out the entire operation in a December 2017 interview with Thomas Duffy, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations. Jiang admitted he received the dummy phones from an "associate" in China, 20 to 30 at at time. He said he used friends, relatives and name variations to receive the packages from China, as well as the replacement phones from Apple. -NPR  US Customs and Border Protection seized three international shipments totaling 95 counterfeit iPhones sent to Zhou. In March 2018, Homeland Security's investigators based out of Portland executed a search warrant at Jiang's residence, where they discovered more than 300 counterfeit iPhones, shipping records and warranty submission records.  Four boxes were also addressed to Yangyang Zhou at four different mailbox facilities in the state of Washington.  Zhou was stopped at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in August, 2018 with several iPhones - one of which was the genuine replacement for the "Apache Helicopter" warranty claim. On one of Zhou's other electronic devices, investigators found photographs showing what appear to be boxes of iPhones.  Jiang faces charges of trafficking in counterfeit goods and wire fraud, while Zhou is being charged with "submitting false or misleading information on export declaration."  Their scam is not new - in fact, fake iPhone laundering has been around for several years. As NPR notes, the problem is so severe in China that "Apple has already developed a more rigorous replacement plan to avoid" fraud.   In 2015, a Chinese-language online forum, called Chinese In LA, warned readers about a job posting seeking to recruit students to return inoperable iPhones from China to U.S. Apples stores. The ad targeted non-English speakers without a Social Security number, promising a "rebate" of $30 per replacement and suggested that 8 to 10 devices a day could be returned. -NPR  Last year a Chinese national living in New Jersey admitted to selling fake iPhones and iPads - pocketing $1.1 million in revenue from the scheme.<end_of_turn>

# The Power of Influencer Marketing

The Power of Influencer Marketing  Apr 5, 2019 5:00 AM PT Influencer marketing, which sprouted from the burgeoning social media sphere, is one of the fastest-growing ways to get a message out there. It uses the popularity of people dubbed "influencers," who have many followers and a wide reach, to market products and sway opinions. It's very much a marketing strategy for the social media age.  "Influencer marketing is one of the fastest-growing marketing channels today," said digital strategist Shane Barker.  "It involves leveraging social media influencers or key leaders to get more people to trust your brand," he told the E-Commerce Times.  Influencer marketing is rooted in traditional messaging. It's simply been updated to account for modern forms of communication and the technologies that enable them.  "Influencer marketing is simply the new, faster word-of-mouth," said Mae Karwowski, CEO of Obviously.  "It's people sharing what they love with their communities," she told the E-Commerce Times.  Why It Works  Effective influencer marketing is all about trust. Though it sometimes can be difficult to get people to click on a banner ad, following the recommendations of an influencer can feel more natural and organic, since it grows out of a perceived relationship.  Influencer marketing can be more effective than traditional methods of altering opinions and shaping purchasing decisions -- particularly for younger audiences.  "The influencers have usually generated a sizeable online following on their social media or blogs," noted Werner Geyser, founder of Influencer Marketing Hub.  "These people trust influencers' recommendations and take notice of what they say and recommend," he told the E-Commerce Times.  Influencers have an impressive framework that's established well before a brand ever partners with them.  "Influencers have already done the hard work," said Geyser. "They have built up a captive and interested audience. In most cases, they will have far more followers than the brand itself."  Good Influence  Effective use of influencers, like any marketing, involves understanding your audience. With influencer marketing, that means understanding the influencers as well. An influencer's sheer number of followers does not necessarily translate into that person being the right fit for a particular brand.  "The biggest mistake firms make is to go for big-name celebrities who may be totally irrelevant to the type of product you sell," said Geyser. "Celebrities are only really useful for mass market products that target a whole range of people. Most firms will do better to work with micro-influencers, who may have fewer followers, but who are more likely to have genuine engagement with them."  Choosing the right influencers, therefore, is key.  "Choosing to work with the wrong influencers can be a major setback," said Barker. "It can turn out to be a total waste of time, money and effort. In fact, the wrong influencers can also bring you negative publicity. To avoid this, you should very carefully choose the influencers you want to work with. Make sure that they are authentic and relevant to your brand and niche. The content they create should align with your brand's values, messaging and campaign goals."  It's also important to make sure to vet influencers to make sure they're who they say they are, and that their followers are real people, not bots.  "A drawback and common fear amongst brands is fakery and inauthenticity," observed Joe Gagliese, managing partner of Viral Nation.  "Social platforms have tactics in place to mitigate fake followings and audiences but must ensure organic follower growth is not impacted by such algorithms," he told the E-Commerce Times. "There are measures to avoid run-ins with influencers who boast a high number of followers who are largely made up of bots, [which results] in extremely low engagement rates and little legitimate influence."  Finally, it's important to abide by all relevant regulations and standards regarding the use of influencers. In particular, brands need to make sure that the fact that they're using influencers is transparent and clear.  "American FTC standards have mandated that advertising through influencers is transparently communicated to audiences through written disclosure -- i.e. #ad -- or verbal disclosure -- "Thank you to [brand] for sponsoring this video," explained Gagliese. "Social platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, have hopped on board by building 'branded partner tags' into the platform."  It may seem a burden to have to disclose so much, but audiences like to know who's partnering with their favorite influencers.  "While some brands may be hesitant to be so forward with advertising to their audiences, followers are typically more receptive to messaging if they understand a creator is partnering with the brand," said Gagliese.  "Brands must be careful in the influencer briefing process to avoid providing scripts. Key messaging is always important to ensure the brand is being represented in the best way, but audiences can easily identify inorganic content quickly," he pointed out. "Avoid the need to dictate an influencer's messaging by choosing the right influencer with the right audience."  As with any business relationship, mutual understanding is key to making influencer marketing run smoothly.  "You have to have clear-cut contracts and know who you're working with, and that goes both ways," said Karwowski. "It's really important that influencers are authentic in what they promote and that brands do their due diligence in their partnerships."  The Evolution of Influence  Because it's a relatively new practice, influencer marketing is still evolving along with the social media platforms and audiences it relies on. Those in the field, however, see a bright future for it.  "This fast-evolving marketing tactic will continue to help brands reach and engage their target audiences," said Barker. "Influencer marketing is all about building and nurturing mutually beneficial relationships. It is only with powerful relationships that you'll be able to run successful campaigns."  As social media platforms evolve and change, so will influencer marketing.  "There has been a huge rise in platforms and agencies over the last few years, as people have seen a hole in the market for tools to help with the mechanics of influencer selection and marketing," said Geyser. "There is no indication that this is likely to change soon."  Also developing are influencer marketing niches that focus on narrowly defined audiences.  "People are beginning to widen their definition of 'influencer' to include important people with smaller followings in micro-niches, and even employees of many firms," said Geyser. "Employee advocacy is really a specialist variation of influencer marketing."  Given its unique place at the intersection of social media and marketing, the practice of influencer marketing eventually might become one of the best ways to reach diverse and ever-changing audiences.  "Influencer marketing ... will continue to evolve in the coming years," said Gagliese. "Influencers provide a pivotal separation between a brand and their customers that is difficult to replicate at scale in other mediums. As the industry evolves, so will the tactics, and I truly believe that it will become a standard marketing channel for brands all over the globe."<end_of_turn>

# Maurizio Sarri Says He Wants to Keep Mateo Kovacic at Chelsea

“Yes, Kovacic is only on loan, of course. I'd like very much that Kovacic will stay with us. You know very well that, in that position, we have some problems because we have only Jorginho. "In my opinion, Kovacic could become a very good central midfielder. Of course, he is not a defensive midfielder but, as you know, in that position I prefer a very technical player. In the last match, Jorginho touched 161 balls. "So, for us, it's very important for us to have big quality in that position. Big quality not for the last pass, but big quality in terms of moving the ball. "No [I don't want to buy another midfielder], I want to try with Kovacic." Yet Sarri may not get his wish as Chelsea have been banned from signing new players for the next two transfer windows. The Blues have appealed the decision, which will be heard by FIFA on Thursday, according to Simon Johnson at the Evening Standard. Kovacic would prefer to stay at Stamford Bridge rather than return to Real Madrid under Zinedine Zidane, per Kinsella and Alberto Pinero. However, he had received criticism during his time with the Premier League side: Football pundit Sebastien offered his view on Kovacic staying at the club: Sébastien @SebC__ I don't have anything wrong to say about Kovačić. He's put 100% effort, never complained, albeit he doesn't look at ease with end to end English games But let's be honest, with Chelsea being likely 5th for two seasons in a row, he's one of the best the club can still attract https://t.co/SoSjHrbEuU Chelsea's transfer plans for the summer will depend on FIFA's decision regarding their current sanction, and also how the club finishes the season. Sarri's side are currently outside the UEFA Champions League qualification places in the Premier League, but they will move into the top four with a victory over West Ham United on Monday. They also remain in contention in the UEFA Europa League and play Slavia Praha in the quarter-finals. The winners of the tournament qualify for the Champions League. If their transfer ban is delayed or overturned, then the ability to offer Champions League football would allow Chelsea to attract a higher calibre of player in the transfer window. It may also be enough to convince Kovacic to leave Real Madrid and join Chelsea permanently.<end_of_turn>

# Thinking of reseeding? Check out these perennial ryegrass trials

Thinking of reseeding? Check out these perennial ryegrass trials  Teagasc has recently released some interesting results regarding the grazing efficiency of certain perennial ryegrass varieties – from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) 2016 recommended list. Grazing efficiency refers to how well grass swards are grazed by the animals. Grass varieties with good grazing efficiency are grazed to a low post-grazing sward height (PostGSH) and varieties with poor grazing efficiency are grazed to a high and uneven PostGSH. The purpose of the study was to identify which perennial ryegrass varieties had the most superior grazing efficiency and identify which varieties were most suitable for grazing. In 2016, 30 perennial ryegrass varieties were chosen and sown. Over the course of the next two years, the plots were grazed (19 times) with the pre and post-grazing swards examined and results recorded. The plots were grazed when they reached a target pre-grazing cover of 1,400kg DM/ha and the cows were removed when a PostGSH of 4cm was achieved. Results  Residual grazed height vs. grazed herbage yield  Over the course of two years, the relationship between the residual grazed height (varietal grazing efficiency) and the grazed herbage yield of the varieties was examined. Varieties with negative residual grazed height (left hand side of the graph) are indicative of varieties with high grazing efficiency; such as AberGain and AstonEnergy – which are both tetraploid varieties. Varieties with positive residual grazed height (right hand side of the graph) are indicative of varieties with low grazing efficiency and may require ‘topping’ during the grazing season period, such as AberChoice and AberMagic – both diploid varieties. Organic matter digestibility (OMD) vs. post-grazing sward height  Additionally, over the two years, the relationship between the varieties OMD and the post-grazing residual were examined. The data clearly shows that the cows grazed varieties with a higher OMD content which achieved lower post grazing sward heights. Tetraploids have higher OMD content so achieved lower post grazing sward heights. Live leaf content vs, post-grazing sward height (cm)  Finally, the relationship between the proportion of live leaf in the grass variety and the post-grazing residual were examined. From the data you can see that cows prefer to graze varieties with a higher leaf content, achieving lower post-grazing residuals. This may be due to the high palatability of the grass or how the grass variety presented itself for grazing. Conclusion  In conclusion, each study shows that tetraploid grass varieties are the leading varieties for achieving the most superior grazing efficiency and so the lowest post-grazing sward heights. However, huge variability exists amongst the tetraploid varieties in terms of residual grazed height, OM content and live leaf content. These results also show the importance of farmers picking a good grazing variety when picking a variety for a grazed sward and how farmers should strive to achieve a tetraploid content of at least 50% in a new reseed.<end_of_turn>

# Lightfoot Asks Finance Committee For More Transparency Before TIF Vote On Lincoln Yards, The 78

CHICAGO (CBS) — Mayor-Elect Lori Lightfoot is calling for more transparency into two massive redevelopment projects, ahead of key votes on taxpayer financing for Lincoln Yards and The 78.  The City Council Finance Committee is expected to vote Monday on $900 million in tax-increment-financing subsidies for the $6 billion Lincoln Yards project, a 54-acre development along the Chicago River between Bucktown and Lincoln Park.  The committee also is set to vote on up to $700 million in TIF money for The 78, a proposed $7 billion development on 62 acres of vacant land along Chicago River between the South Loop and Chinatown, which developers have touted as the city’s 78th neighborhood.  Before that vote, however, Lightfoot wants the committee to hold a “subject matter hearing to address major concerns” about the two projects.  “From day one, I have raised concerns about these deals and the deeply flawed process that has led us to this moment. That’s why I’m calling for the committee meeting tomorrow to be a transparent and fulsome subject matter hearing to address questions including consequences for other TIF districts, affordable housing options, plans for minority- and women-owned businesses, and impacts on diversity, population density, schools, traffic, and other factors,” Lightfoot said in a statement released Sunday night. “For major development projects to drive equitable economic growth, they must be coupled with community input and a transparent, informed decision-making process.”  There is also growing opposition to the two projects among new aldermen. Eight incoming aldermen have called on Finance Committee Chairman Pat O’Connor to cancel Monday’s meeting to vote on the TIF money for Lincoln Yards and The 78 until the new mayor and new City Council take office.  Critics have said there’s not enough affordable housing included in the projects, and what is included is too expensive for most low-income families.  Lightfoot has said there are many other questions she would like answered before the city moves forward with the projects.  “I’ve been very clear that I think that the process has been very flawed. There’s a lot of questions that still are not answered regarding impacts on infrastructure, transportation, and just the surrounding quality of life. We are looking at a level of density that we don’t have in our city outside of the central business district,” she told CBS 2 last week.  The Finance Committee meeting starts at 10 a.m. at City Hall.<end_of_turn>

# Police told shocked mum she had been stalked for two years

When somebody in work passed Kelly a note saying how much they loved her everything fell into place.  As soon as she read the note saying somebody she knew from work wanted to spend the rest of their life with her she realised their behaviour was getting out of hand.  But it was only when she eventually went to police that she learned the full extent of an obsession that had been keeping her awake at night and stopped her from letting her children play out.  Police told her the person she knew through work had been stalking her online and in person for two years beforehand.  Kelly, not her real name, said: "One day, unexpectedly, they passed me a note telling me how much they loved me and that they wanted to spend their life with me.  “It was at that point that I started to piece together a number of other events over the past year which had made me feel uncomfortable.  "My stalker would wait outside my workplace and family home for hours to see or speak to me. I told them to stop and that seemed to work for a bit, but I finally contacted the police when I suspected they had moved into a property nearby.  "People around me were surprised that I didn’t report it to police sooner. I just kept hoping this person would get the message and it would stop. I didn’t want to make a fuss.”  But by not reporting it to the police, Kelly was having to shoulder the burden alone.  "The stalking took an emotional toll on me,” she explained. “I couldn’t understand why this person was so fixated on me and acting so bizarrely.  “I felt vulnerable and anxious. I couldn’t sleep; I was irritable and short tempered. I wouldn’t let my children play outside, and when they found out why it upset them.  "So much of my time was taken by my stalker. Its precious time that I feel was robbed from me."  Eventually she reported it to police and her stalker was banned for life from contacting her.  The police also referred her to an Independent Stalking Advocacy Caseworker (ISAC) who really understood what she was going through.  Kelly said: "I felt a huge sense of relief after I reported my stalker to the police.  “The ultimate relief came once the trial was over and my stalker was given a restraining order preventing them from contacting me.  "It was only during the investigation that I found out that this person had already been stalking me online and in person for two years before I became aware of it.  "I’d advise anyone who thinks they’re being stalked to report it to police, tell friends, colleagues and neighbours and gather as much evidence as you can.”  Kelly spoke out to support National Stalking Awareness Week which takes place between Monday 8 and Friday April 12 and is being backed by Gloucestershire Constabulary.  Police say stalking and harassment are some of the most frequently experienced forms of abuse and can terrify its victims.  Research released by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust in 2016 states that around one in five women and one in 12 men in the UK have experienced stalking at some point in their lifetime.  Her family, through the Hollie Gazzard Trust, has launched a Hollie Guard app which alerts loved ones if someone is in danger.  The act of stalking can involve loitering outside of someone’s home or workplace but can also include behaviours such as repeatedly sending messages, tracking someone’s location and breaking into or damaging property.  DCI Richard Ocone said: "We’ve seen locally how stalking can tragically take lives. We’re running this campaign over National Stalking Awareness Week to raise awareness of how to put a stop to stalking and harassment and to encourage people to come forward and report it instead of suffering in silence.  "It’s not flattering to be harassed or stalked, it’s unwanted and unwarranted. It can be mentally, physically, socially and financially devastating to victims and their families.  "The idea of a stalker often conjures up images of a stranger following someone through a dark alley. In fact stalking and harassment is most often committed by ex-partners and someone the victim already knows who becomes fixated and obsessed."<end_of_turn>

Guy nailed all three of his free throws to lift No. 1 Virginia into Monday's NCAA national championship game. That much is etched in stone. However, there was an uncalled violation seconds earlier that would have in all likelihood sent No. 5 Auburn to the title game. Junior guard Ty Jerome tried a behind-the-back dribble to lose Auburn senior guard Bryce Brown but bounced the ball off his own heel. Jerome then picked up the ball, untouched by anybody else, and restarted his dribble. That, according to CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore, should have been whistled as a double dribble. If referees would have ruled it a double dribble, Auburn would have gained possession. It was not. Now, Virginia has a shot at winning the men's program's first NCAA championship against either No. 2 Michigan State or No. 3 Texas Tech.<end_of_turn>

# Actor pleads guilty for sex cult charges

Former Smallville star Allison Mack on Monday pleaded guilty for her role in sex-slave cult Nxivm. A sobbing Mack, 36, appeared before a judge in Brooklyn federal court, where she copped to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges — including extortion and forced labour — just hours before jury selection was set to begin in her case, the New York Post reported. “I must take full responsibility for my conduct. I am very sorry for my role in this case. I am very sorry to my family and to the good people I hurt through my misguided adherence to [Nxivm leader] Keith Raniere’s teachings,” Mack told the court. Mack confessed to being part of a secret master-slave group within Nxivm called DOS, admitting that she kept a slave and instructed women in the group “to perform services for me.” She said the system was “designed to make them think they could suffer serious harm” if they didn’t perform the services — because they’d handed over damaging collateral to DOS such as nude photos and financial details. Prosecutors allege that women in DOS were kept on starvation diets, branded with Raniere’s initials and groomed to have sex with him. Mack is facing 20 years in prison under the charges she pleaded guilty to Monday. It was not clear if she has a co-operation deal with the government, and her lawyers declined to comment. Mack was among six people arrested last year over their roles in Nxivm, including Raniere and Seagram’s liquor heiress Claire Bronfman, who helped fund the organisation with her vast fortune. Nxivm co-founder Nancy Salzman and her daughter Lauren Salzman both pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy charges for their involvement in the group last month. Lauren was also a “master” in DOS — and has admitted to keeping her own personal slave locked in a room for two years — while Nancy confessed to hacking into emails of the group’s perceived enemies and destroying evidence that could be used against it.

# Sea of flowers left outside hospital for Lee Belgium

"You will be missed by everyone" - a sea of floral tributes have been left outside Bristol Children's Hospital following the death of Lee Belgium, a true 'super hero'.  The brave eight-year-old passed away from complications related to his cancer on Saturday (April 6).  Lee from Emersons Green died after being diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer for the third time.  Tonight his friends came together outside of Bristol Children's Hospital where Lee spent many of his remaining days to mourn the 'superhero's' death.  Lines of colourful flowers now hang from a gate near the hospital's entrance.  One message reads: "To Lee, we love you and we will miss you. Fly high."  Another says: "Lee, (the super hero).  "You will be missed by everyone and we wish you could still be here with all of us.  "You are a true superhero and wish there was more we could of done."  One mourner wrote: "We love you so much Lee, always and forever.  "Thank you for being a part of our lives.  "Now you are at peace but my God we miss you.  "I promise to always talk about you with Millies and Eli. as they grow up.  "You should've got the chance to grow up with them. We will always remember you.  "You are our superhero."  After battling the disease twice already in his young life, Lee was almost given a bone marrow transplant which could have changed his life for the better.  However, his hopes of having the operation were dashed when doctors found the cancer cells had come back last year.  NHS doctors said there was nothing more they could do which led to Lee's family fundraising for alternative treatment in Turkey.  More than £80,000 had been raised for Lee’s treatment and he was set to travel to Turkey at the end of December, however a combination of a strong course of chemotherapy, pneumonia, and a fungal infection in his lung meant that he was too unwell to travel at the time.<end_of_turn>

# Norris aiming to carry Bahrain momentum to Chinese GP weekend - The Checkered Flag

Lando Norris says that he aims to bring the momentum built up by the McLaren F1 Team‘s first points of the 2019 Formula 1 season into the Chinese Grand Prix weekend.  Rookie Norris opened McLaren’s account for the year with a strong drive to sixth place in Bahrain, scoring the first points of his F1 career.  Norris’s result equalled the sixth place scored by Jenson Button at the 2000 Brazilian Grand Prix, also the 2009 champion’s second F1 race.  Alongside the season-opening race in Australia, China marks a new circuit for Norris – but the 19-year-old says that he has had ample practice in the simulator building up to the weekend.  “Another race and another new circuit,” said Norris.  “I’m looking forward to trying out the Shanghai track for the first time, I’ve done plenty of practice in the sim so now I’m excited to drive it for real.  “Last weekend went well for us in Bahrain, I’m going to try and carry that momentum forward to the Chinese Grand Prix.  “From what I’ve seen this looks to be a fun track, so hopefully we will see some more racing and overtaking.”  McLaren has been caught unawares by its strong race pace in 2019, with Norris saying that the team initially thought it was going to be better in qualifying-spec.  Norris’s team-mate Carlos Sainz Jr. has had two promising performances ended by reliability and contact when on course for potential points finishes.  2019 FIA Formula 2 championship runner-up Norris has made it into the top 10 shootout in qualifying on both occasions this season, and hopes that the 1000th Grand Prix – one that will be marked by a commemorative helmet design – will bring more of the same.  “I have a one-off helmet design for China to celebrate the 1,000th grand prix race,” he added.  “It’s really exciting to be taking part in this special occasion on only my third F1 entry.”<end_of_turn>

# Did Trump administration break law by blocking Florida reps from entering migrant shelter?

Members of Congress denied entry to the Homestead child detention center  Three Florida congresswomen were sent home Monday after attempting to inspect the Homestead child detention center.  On Wednesday, U.S. Reps. Donna Shalala, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, South Florida’s three Democratic representatives, had requested to visit the shelter on Monday. They wanted to inspect the facility, which houses about 2,000 unaccompanied migrant children, after the government announced last week it would expand the center to detain as many as 3,200 children. “At this point, it is unclear what new structures or accommodations are being made to adequately house the additional children,” said Mucarsel-Powell, whose Congressional district includes Homestead. “There remains a major lack of transparency about what is occurring within the facility’s walls.”  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the privately run facility, said it needed two weeks’ notice to allow lawmakers into the facility and refused them entry, citing its 2015 policy.  “To ensure a facility visit does not interfere with the staff’s ability to provide for the safety, well-being or privacy of unaccompanied alien children, especially during a period of high influx such as the present, we require a minimum two-week notification for the facility visit,” an HHS spokesperson said. “This has been HHS policy since 2015. It meets our current statutory obligation to provide members of Congress with facility access.”  The congresswomen, however, called the agency’s denial “illegal,” citing recently passed legislation, signed by President Donald Trump, that prohibits HHS from denying lawmakers from entering a facility to conduct oversight. After being blocked by armed security guards, Wasserman Schultz took out her cell phone and recited, verbatim, Section 234 of bill 115-245.  “It is federal law, and if you don’t allow us us access, you’re in violation of federal law,” Wasserman Schultz said.  Echoed Shalala: “This is the law of the land.”  The guard directed the lawmakers to the shelter’s director, who reiterated that access would not be granted.  HHS would not comment on the conflicting mandates but said its 2105 policy reigns.  Some experts disagree, however. Lou Fisher, a scholar in residence at the Constitution Project who previously worked at the Library of Congress specializing in the separation of powers between Congress and the White House, said the legislation passed by Congress does not give wiggle room for HHS to prevent lawmakers from visiting facilities. “I don’t see that the statutory language would bar entry to lawmakers,” Fisher said. In a statement Monday, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the Democratic member of Congress who chairs the House subcommittee that funds HHS, said she’s considering legal action.  “There should be nothing to hide at these facilities, yet HHS has continued to throw up roadblocks and promote ill-conceived reasons to keep Members of Congress out,” DeLauro said in a statement. “As such, I am examining all legal remedies along with Congresswomen Wasserman Schultz, Shalala, and Mucarsel-Powell. This will not stand.” None of the lawmakers would specify what those legal actions may be.  The day after the representatives requested to tour the shelter, John Kelly, Trump’s former chief of staff and the former head of the U.S. Southern Command in Doral, was spotted entering the Homestead facility on a golf cart.  The company that runs the shelter, the only for-profit child detention center in the country, once employed Kelly as a lobbyist. He said he cut ties with the company when he joined the Trump administration. “Earlier this week, Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly was seen visiting the facility that HHS is refusing to let us into,” Mucarsel-Powell said.  She also noted “the facility is not certified by the state, and state child welfare agencies do not inspect the facility. There have been several allegations of sexual assault coming from the facility since its reopening under this administration.”  Last month, Rep. Ted Deutch, a Democrat who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, released data provided to him by HHS that showed that thousands of migrant children have been sexually abused while being detained at U.S. government-run shelters.  The documents showed that more than 1,000 allegations of sexual abuse of unaccompanied minors were reported to the Office of Refugee Resettlement every fiscal year since 2015. The allegations include rape, sexual assault and harassment.  It’s unclear how many of those allegations came from the Homestead shelter.<end_of_turn>

# Welcome to Black Belt Essentials

We’re proud to announce the release of Aikido Journal Academy’s newest course – “Black Belt Essentials” with Patricia Hendricks.  This is a very special project for us. Stanley Pranin, the founder of Aikido Journal, was Patricia Hendricks’ first aikido instructor, and she was there to help Stan print and assemble the very first issues of Aiki News. Patricia is deeply tied to our history.  “Black Belt Essentials” is designed to be both a comprehensive technical reference and a beautiful showcase of the classical forms of aikido. We wanted it to be about both the art and the science of aikido.  This course provides a reference model of what a shodan test might involve, but we view it more generally as a high-level overview of foundational empty-handed and weapons techniques.  Patricia Hendricks is an exceptional aikido master who fuses fluid and elegant movement with immense power and stability. Her technique is about as close as you can get to the founder’s form. Over the course of production, I found a number of photos of Morihei Ueshiba in our archives shot from similar angles. The parallels are uncanny.  We couldn’t think of a better instructor to work with to produce the first instructional course in the 45 year history of Aikido Journal that features a female master.  We hope you take a look at our newly released “Black Belt Essentials”.  Josh Gold  Executive Editor, Aikido Journal<end_of_turn>

# 3 MNS activists booked for beating BJP worker in Maharashtra

3 MNS activists booked for beating BJP worker in Maharashtra  Thane, Apr 09: Three local Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) activists have been booked for allegedly beating a BJP worker in Thane district of Maharashtra over a post forwarded by him on WhatsApp which they found offending, police said on Tuesday.  According to the complaint filed by the BJP activist, Pradeep Rane, on Sunday he received a post on WhatsApp about the MNS along with a picture of its party chief Raj Thackeray, Rabodi police station's senior inspector R M Somavanshi said.  Rane forwarded the post to some other people. Later, three MNS workers also saw the post and felt offended following which they thrashed Rane, he said.  The complainant alleged that he apologised and also deleted the post from his mobile phone, but the MNS workers allegedly made a video-recording of the beating incident which they posted on social media and also aired on a local channel, the official said.  Based on his complaint, the police registered a case against the three MNS activists under IPC Sections 452 (house- trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with an intent to provoke breach of peace) and 500 (defamation), he said.

# Ten Sovereigns leads Aidan O'Brien team for new season

Ten Sovereigns leads Aidan O'Brien team for new season  Last Updated: 09/04/19 7:26am  Ten Sovereigns will spearhead what trainer Aidan O'Brien believes is another formidable squad for the new Flat season.  O'Brien opened the gates of Ballydoyle to the press on Monday morning and discussed some of his big hopes for the new campaign. Speaking about the general strength of his team, the 21-times champion trainer said: "We think at the moment we have ammunition, but it is moving and changing all the time. You have to have them performing, but we are hoping we are on the right track.  "We have 200 horses riding out in total - 100 are two-year-olds, we have 10 to 12 older horses and the rest are three-year-olds. That is our full capacity, but it is very manageable. "Last year the horses weren't able to acclimatise as there was snow early in the year and it became very warm during the summer. Not once were the horses galloped on grass last year from January to December, whereas this year we have done a lot of grass work already. "The first weekend in May is usually the first time we hope to have them in good order and other than that, the idea is to start and see where we are." The star of O'Brien's juvenile crop last season was Ten Sovereigns, who won each of his three starts - completing his hat-trick with a narrow verdict in the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket. A return to the Rowley Mile for the 2000 Guineas is his likely starting point. "Ten Sovereigns physically has done well and is a very relaxed horse. Nothing would suggest he wouldn't get a mile," said O'Brien. "We will skip the Greenham Stakes at Newbury (on Saturday) as there is no point taking on Too Darn Hot when he isn't fully ready and he will go straight to the 2000 Guineas." More immediately, O'Brien - who also showed off his Vertem Futurity Trophy winner Magna Grecia - is planning to send two runners to Chelmsford on Thursday, with both Antilles and U S S Michigan confirmed as intended runners in the Woodford Reserve Cardinal Conditions Stakes, a trial for the Kentucky Derby. O'Brien said: "Antilles and U S S Michigan will both run at Chelmsford. If we were to have a horse for the Kentucky Derby, U S S Michigan would be the only one. "I'm not yet sure if a win at Chelmsford would be enough to get him in to Kentucky, but he is a big, long-striding cruiser and we always thought he would get a mile and further." The Kentucky Derby is one of the races O'Brien would love to add to his CV, having so far come up short in 'The Run For The Roses' - most recently with the well-fancied Mendelssohn last season. "Last year was a good experience to witness it and see it - it was totally ruthless," said the trainer. "We learned a lot and the fierceness of the whole thing surprised us. It was a good experience and there are things we need to improve on." Sergei Prokofiev has already been seen in winning form this season - making a successful return in Listed Cork Stakes at Navan late last month. O'Brien said: "Sergei Prokofiev is a very fast horse - as fast a horse as I've ever had. "He was a three-year-old running against older horses with a penalty at Naas and won. "It's the way he comes through his race - he is very fast and is a five-furlong horse, but won't stay six furlongs." O'Brien has some thinking to do in terms of splitting up his potential Derby candidates. He added: "The Derby Trials are coming up a week or 10 days after the Guineas, so there will be a bunch trained for the Guineas and it is also possible there will be a couple of Derby horses we'll let run in the Guineas. "There is a lot of horses to get out and the likes of Circus Maximus could go to a Guineas instead of a Derby trial. "Hermosa will go straight to the Guineas and along with So Perfect both have physically done very well. Just Wonderful and Fairyland will also go straight to the Guineas and I'm very happy with both. "I'm very happy with Japan and Mt Everest - a beautiful-moving horse who has done extremely well physically. "I was very pleased with Broome winning at Leopardstown the other day and Anthony Van Dyck is another Derby horse and will run in a trial first. Old Glory and Norway are other horses who will run in Derby trials. "Goddess is just coming back into full work. She was a bit sick last year and didn't get back to run. "I don't think she will be back ready to run in the Classics and if you asked us now, I'd say not. "She will probably be looking at Royal Ascot and have a run before it." O'Brien's small but select team of older horses includes Capri and Kew Gardens, of whom he said: "The Ascot Gold Cup is the big one for us mid-season and Capri will step up in trip and go the staying route. "Kew Gardens will go the mile-and-a-half route first before running in the Coronation Cup and then the King George." O'Brien also gave an insight into how much the time he gets to spend with his horses dominates his thoughts. He said: "I look forward to coming out to the horses every single morning and every morning is different and new. I don't have any other interest - not another thing. This is my golf and everything rolled into one. "The only time I'm not here is when I'm at the races for a few hours - you need every minute of the day to get it all together and you need to stay as fresh as you can the whole time. "I work through the day first and would take time in the evenings to relax, but you have to keep yourself fresh and clear to get the information straight away to make a decision about something." I don't have any other interest - not another thing O'Brien's string was hit by a virus in midsummer last year, and he added: "You have to be prepared that a virus can happen to you, as it can happen to everybody.  "Things don't always work and I would look back on last year and see how and why it happened. If we made decisions on how and why it (the virus) came in, I would think back on those things and we would try to change them. "We didn't have a bad year last year, but there were some races the horses didn't go in and some horses didn't progress the way we would have liked, but there was no point in crying or talking about it."<end_of_turn>

# Sleeping bags on the floor

Humboldt State University is always looking for ways to recruit students. There is a program called the Preview Plus Weekend where university housing provides visiting students from within the state of California an opportunity to experience the “college life” for themselves. Students are paired up with a host who is an HSU student already attending the school.  The students are paired up with a host to give them the best experience to persuade them to go to HSU. In this program, students sleep on the floor of the host’s room with the sleeping bag they are provided to bring. They have several activities that housing has provided for them for the duration of three days.  Marcella Feathers, a 17 year old from Oakland, California, said that there are too many stairs at HSU.  “But other than that, I truly believe Humboldt State University is the school I am going to choose at the end of the day,” Feathers said. “I really liked my host as well, she actually convinced me come to this school, she definitely made it an enjoyable time.”  Hosts also get benefits while signing up for this program, they’re awarded guaranteed housing, free food at the events they attend with the students, and cash. Isabel Brambila, a student from Sacramento, said that she didn’t get the vibe that she wanted from HSU.  “Since I’m from the city, I don’t think this scenery fits my personality,” Brambila said. “I definitely won’t be coming here, I think I’m leaning more towards Sacramento State instead, I just don’t think this school is for me.”  Along with student’s experiences, hosts had some experiences of their own. Daisy Caballero, a zoology major at HSU, said that she usually sleeps on the couch. Caballero gave her bed to her guest so they wouldn’t sleep on the floor.  “It was a really great experience showing the upcoming students the school,” Caballero said. “I think this program helps students figure out whether or not they want to come here because they are literally experience college for themselves.”  Caballero wishes she had known about the program so she could have experienced the school a bit more before deciding whether or not this was the school for her.  “I truly only chose this school because of the price amongst other schools,” Caballero said. “But if I would have known it was going to be so secluded I probably wouldn’t have picked it.”  Students who attended the preview plus program will decide whether or not Humboldt State University is their choice of school they want to go to. All students living on campus have a chance to participate in this program and get the benefits out of it as well.<end_of_turn>

# Mopani Resumes Underground Operations

Mopani Copper Mines has announced the resumption of operations suspended last month to pave way for investigations following two mine accidents that led to the loss of five lives in a space of two months.  Three miners died as a result of an underground fire at Mindola North Shaft in February while two others died at Mopani Copper Mines South Ore Body shaft 3010ML in Kitwe.  The move led to the suspension of all underground operations to investigate the cause of accidents.  The mine later sent miners to its training centre in Mufulira to be retrained in safety.  Mopani Copper Mines Public Relations Manager Nebert Mulenga has confirmed that all underground operations have resumed at both Nkana and Mufulira mine sites following an intensive safety audit of underground operations.  “Mopani Copper Mines Plc declared a safety work stoppage on 19th March 2019 and during the suspension of operations, all employees have taken supervisory and safety training sessions as well as signed commitment letters to undertake safe work. It is our hope that employees have benefitted from the supervisory and training sessions, which reinforced, among other things, the duty and right of each and every employee to report unsafe practices and refuse to undertake any assignment deemed unsafe,” stated Mulenga who, however, did not indicate the outcome of the investigations, saying further details would be provided as appropriate.<end_of_turn>

# Gen. Soleimani Urges Popular Forces to Help Flood-Hit People

IRGC Quds Force Commander Major General Qassem Soleimani has urged all popular forces who long to fight against terrorism in Syria to come to the flood-stricken regions in south-western Iran and help the affected people.  General Soleimani made the remarks during a visit to the flood-hit areas of Khuzestan province.  He said that helping the people of Khuzestan is like defending the holy shrines in Syria and defending the Iranian territory during the eight-year war against Iraq.  “At the moment many youths are insisting to be deployed to Syria to defend the holy shrines, but helping people in Khuzestan is the same as defending the holy shrines because nothing is more important than preserving the dignity of a human being,” added the senior commander.  “I was impressed by the efforts of people in Khuzestan. Although the government insists on evacuating, they are resisting with preliminary equipment. I think we have passed the main wave of the crisis, but at the same time we must help people not to be disturbed.”  Flooding swamped northeast Iran in mid-March before spreading to the west and southwest of the country later in the month. Heavy rains brought more floods to the west and southwest at the start of April.  One of the worst-hit areas is southern Khuzestan province where fresh flood warnings have been issued to the people.  Evacuation orders remain in place for homes near river banks and in areas at high risk of flooding. Large areas remain inundated as the affected citizens are trying to cope with the situation.<end_of_turn>

# Man Utd Tipped to Trigger £25m Toby Aldweireld Release Clause as Conflicting Summer Rumours Continue

Manchester United have been tipped to trigger the £25m release clause in the contract of Tottenham Hotspur defender Toby Alderweireld that becomes active this summer.  Alderweireld had been on course to become a free agent at the end of the season after failing to agree a new contract with Spurs, but the club triggered a one-year extension to take the existing deal to 2020. However, that action also invoked the release clause.  The tabloid report alleges that Alderweireld has been 'identified' as someone who could immediately 'slot in' as United aim to add an experienced star to strengthen at the back. It is also said, however, that the club is 'yet to make contact' with Spurs over a possible deal.  Troublingly, there remains no media consensus on what United's transfer plans for the summer may be and that makes it very difficult to establish which stories on the subject contain truth.  Alderweireld is at the cheaper end of the market as a result of the release clause, but another report from a different source earlier this week claimed that United will target an expensive Virgil van Dijk-type signing, with eyes on Kalidou Koulibaly and Raphael Varane.  Either player could easily cost £100m, four times as much as Alderweireld, and would represent a huge new world record for a defender, way beyond the £75m Liverpool paid for Van Dijk.  And yet, there are still claims out there that a centre-back isn't even United's main priority in the transfer market this summer. The latest from journalist Duncan Castles is that the club 'intends to spend heavily', but primarily on a right-back, midfielder and right winger.  That would mean keeping faith in the likes of Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Eric Bailly.<end_of_turn>

# Mothers-to-be, exercising during pregnancy can benefit your offspring

WASHINGTON DC: A recent study conducted in mice found that offspring born to mice that exercised were less likely to become obese after consuming a high-fat diet later in life.  The new findings were presented at the 2019 Experimental Biology meeting.  Although previous studies have shown that exercise by obese females benefits their offspring, this is the first research to demonstrate that the same is true when non-obese females exercise.  "Based on our findings, we recommend that women, whether or not they are obese or have diabetes, exercise regularly during pregnancy because it benefits their children's metabolic health," said Jun Seok Son, who conducted the study.  The researchers examined the offspring of mice that performed 60 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every morning during pregnancy. Offspring born to mice that didn't exercise were used as a control group.  At weaning, the offspring of the exercising mice showed increased levels of proteins associated with brown adipose tissue compared to the control group. This type of tissue converts fat and sugar into heat.  The researchers also observed higher body temperatures in the exercise group, indicating that their brown adipose tissue was more efficient or had a higher thermogenic function which has been shown to prevent obesity and metabolic problems.  After weaning, the offspring followed a high-fat diet for eight weeks. The mice in the exercise group not only gained less weight on the high-fat diet but also showed fewer symptoms of metabolic diseases such as diabetes and fatty liver disease.  "Our data suggest that the lack of exercise in healthy women during pregnancy can predispose their children to obesity and associated metabolic diseases partially through impairing thermogenic function," said Son.<end_of_turn>

# Suspect arrested in S Carolina university student’s death | Federal News Network

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Police arrested a man Saturday in connection with the death of a college student who apparently got into the suspect’s car thinking it was her Uber ride.  Nathaniel David Rowland, 24, was arrested early Saturday after a police officer noticed him driving a black Chevy Impala, the same type of car that Samantha Josephson got into as she left a bar shortly after 2 a.m. Friday in the city of Columbia’s 5 Points area, Columbia Police Chief Skip Holbrook said at a news conference.  Rowland tried to run, but the officer was able to catch up to him, Holbrook said. When they returned to the car, he said, the officer saw what appeared to be blood in the car.  “We believe … that she simply mistakenly got into this particular car thinking it was an Uber ride,” Holbrook said of Josephson, noting that surveillance video captured her getting into the car. “She opened the door and got into it and departed with the suspect driving.”  Insight by the Trezza Media Group: Data experts from DHS, Army and NOAA explore big data in government in this free webinar.  Rowland will be charged with murder and kidnapping, Rowland said. It was unclear if he had an attorney.  Holbrook said hunters found Josephson’s body late Friday afternoon off a dirt road in rural Clarendon County, which is about 65 miles (105 kilometers) southeast of Columbia.

# National trend towards consolidation of mobile home park ownership

Mobile home owners who for years have enjoyed some immunity from rising housing costs are increasingly finding themselves subjected to massive rent increases, not just here in Iowa, but across the country. Havenpark Capital, a Utah-based real estate investment firm, raised eyebrows — along with rents — after it purchased parks in the Iowa City and Des Moines metro areas and immediately announced plans for rent spikes. In North Liberty, rents at Golfview Mobile Home Park will rise 58% and in Waukee, rents at Midwest Country Estates will rise 69%. On Friday, Havenpark Capital purchased two more mobile communities: Iowa City's Sunrise Village and West Branch's West Branch Village. And as it turns out these are just the tip of the iceberg. There is a growing trend among some of the largest private equity firms and institutional investors to acquire assets in the manufactured housing sector, according to a 2019 report put together by three housing advocates groups: Private Equity Stakeholder Project, Manufactured Housing Action and Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund. The top 50 manufactured housing community owners together own 680,000 home sites — a 26 percent increase between 2016 and 2018, according to data from the National Manufactured Home Owners's Manufactured Housing Institute. The authors of the report note that the need to produce greater profits is leading to cost increases for park residents nationwide. "Manufactured home communities are interesting communities," said Kevin Borden, co-director of Manufactured Housing Action, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that organizes residents of mobile home parks to pursue housing affordability and resident protections. "They are relatively affordable for low income workers immigrant workers and seniors on fixed incomes. They provide folks with a sense of a home community." In 2018, there were approximately 8.5 million manufactured homes in the United States, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the nation’s housing stock, according to the Manufactured Housing Institute. This has been a source of affordable housing, in particular for rural and low-income residents. "These are affordable homes for low income folks," said Liz Voigt of Manufactured Housing Action and a co--author of the 2019 report. "That's what the market has been for a long time. It hasn't really occurred to people that they could gouge them for 80 percent of their Social Security check. That's the analysis that these companies have seen: they could make a very big increase in profits based on rent increases in nearly any conditions." In a statement to the Press-Citizen in reference to their rent increase in North Liberty, Havenpark Capital said the previous owner's rent prices had not kept pace with the market. They wrote that if it were not for Havenpark stepping in, the property might have been taken over by commercial retail developers. But even if the land remained a park, seniors on fixed incomes, low-wage earners on limited incomes may not have much of an option in the end. Part of the issue is residents commonly own their mobile home but not the land underneath it. If lot rents become unaffordable, residents may have no other option but to try and sell their home to the park or abandon it all together. Moving homes to another park can cost thousands of dollars and moving often means sustaining damage to the home, further depreciating its value. Don Lund is a resident of Golfview Mobile Home Park. He has lived there since 1997, but a sharp rise in rent may mean he has to look at other options. Zachary Oren Smith, Zachary Oren Smith The 2019 report quotes material from Mobile Home University, a project of RV Horizons aimed at educating aspiring mobile home park investors on the revenue model: "The fact that tenants can't afford the $5,000 it takes to move a mobile home ... makes it easy to raise rent without losing any occupancy." Compared to larger private equity firms like YES! Communities, which owns 54,000 home sites, Havenpark Capital is relatively small. But Voigt and Borden said the private real estate firm benefits from the same investment strategy. To create protections for these communities, there are three "buckets" of policy solutions Voigt pointed to that she said localities and states should pursue to add protections for manufactured home owners in their communities. "There is a regulatory environment in which (these firms) operate that has created an enormously profitable business on the backs of poor people," Voigt said. The first strategy would be to find some consistent means of regulating rent. Voigt emphasized that these regulations look different in different places. One example is in Humboldt County, California where voters passed an ordinance to regulate rent increases for spaces in mobile home parks with ten or more spaces in the unincorporated area of Humboldt County. Rents can only legally be increased to keep up with the consumer price index; to afford capital improvements with approval of a majority of tenants; or in the case of a new resident, at a maximum of 5%. In Delaware, property owners can raise rent above the consumer price index provided they have not received any violations that threaten the health or safety or residents that persists for more than 15 days and the increase is directly related to operating, maintaining or improving the manufactured home community. "There are different ways to get there," Voigt said. "But the idea is (property owners) shouldn't just have total control over setting these arbitrary rent increases." The second strategy is for residents to have a say in how the park they live in is improved, and an avenue for making complaints if it is not being taken care of properly. "(Large firms) don't seem to have a long term investment in the community's ongoing infrastructure and communities sustained health," Voigt said. "There are are laws in most places about basic code standards, but making those clear responsibilities for the community owner would incentivize investment." In addition, Voigt said it is important for residents to have a clear path to report problems with health and safety risks, management, lease provisions, invoices and other problems. When the owner is out of state, this might mean site managers and mandated grievance procedures. Jessica Hutton, a Golfview Mobile Home Park resident, still is unsure about what her rent will be come June 1. Zachary Oren Smith, Zachary Oren Smith The third strategy is more complicated. Even if there are limits on the amount rent can be increased and residents have the ability to reliably file grievances, an investment firm is in business to generate revenue. While this doesn't necessarily put them at odds with residents, a 58 percent tax increase does. "There needs to be a clear path towards alternative forms of ownership," Voigt said. They ask states to enact laws that give mobile park tenants and associations a chance to buy their park if property owners are approached with an offer. Voigt said that if our goal is to keep these parks affordable in the long term, drastic changes in ownership might be one of the few ways to keep the needs of tenants at the heart of decision making. "As this trend picks up and bigger and bigger private equity groups with huge access to capital buy more and more of these communities, it is going to put increasing pressures on mom and pop parks to sell out," Voigt said.

# South Korea court says abortion ban is unconstitutional

SEOUL: South Korea's Constitutional Court said on Thursday (Apr 11) a law criminalizing abortion was unconstitutional, a landmark ruling that will overturn a ban on abortion that had been in place since 1953. The court said in a statement the ban on abortion, as well as a law that made doctors who conduct abortions with a woman's consent liable to criminal charges, were both unconstitutional.  However, the court said the current law would remain in effect until the end of next year. The court had previously upheld the abortion law in 2012. South Korea is one of the few industrialised nations where the procedure is illegal except for instances of rape, incest and when the mother's health is at risk. Women who undergo the procedure can be jailed for a year and fined, while doctors who carry out terminations can be given two years in prison. The 1953 law is widely flouted and rarely results in prosecutions, but activists say it leaves women facing being unable to pay for terminations, unsafe procedures and social isolation.<end_of_turn>

# Boosting growth in France and making reforms beneficial to all

by Antoine Goujard and Pierre Guérin, France Desk, OECD Economics Department  The French economy is slowing, but less than its neighbours. The French authorities have engaged a significant reform agenda that should be complemented with particular care for inequality issues. Income per capita growth has lagged the euro area average (Figure 1). The 2019 OECD Economic Survey, launched on 9 April 2019 by the OECD Secretary General and the Minister of Finance, points that there is a need to boost growth and ensure that the gains of reforms reach low-income households.  Reforms need to be beneficial to all and improve the prospects of low-income populations. The recent “yellow vest” demonstrations have shown that gains of reforms seem elusive for part of the population. Income per capita when corrected by household composition has been flat for the past ten years (Figure 2). Employment rates, notably for the youth, low skilled and older workers are low, and economy-wide productivity has declined as in many other OECD countries. Moreover, weak social mobility tends to perpetuates economic and social situations from one generation to the next, despite the relatively low poverty rate after taxes and transfers (Boone and Goujard, 2019).  What will it take to reach more sustainable growth and make sure that it benefits all?  The government’s reform agenda is significant. The “PACTE” law would strengthen business dynamism and firm growth. Comprehensive labour reforms, lower business and labour taxes and a welcome productivity-enhancing public investment plan would help raise medium-term growth and boost employment. Spending reviews and a planned pension reform are set to increase the effectiveness of public expenditures and make room for tax cuts, while preserving public investment. OECD estimates, covering a broad part of ongoing reforms and based on the experience of other OECD countries (Akgun et al., 2017; Causa et al. 2016), show that, if fully implemented, these measures could boost GDP per capita by 3.2% at a ten-year horizon and would mostly benefit middle- and lower-middle income households in the medium term (Figure 3).  Looking forward, France should capitalise on this reform agenda and take further measures to increase high-quality jobs, improve social mobility and raise public spending efficiency. Additional measures could do much to boost employment and productivity, and to ensure higher equality of opportunity, while lifting the average annual growth rate and helping to reduce firmly the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Such measures could push GDP per capita gains to 5% at a ten-year horizon. This is among the key policy insights of the OECD’s 2019 Economic Survey of France:  Raising well-being will depend on strengthening skills and greater inclusion of low-skilled workers in the labour force. This requires increasing the quality of education from an early age and reforms to ensure high-quality lifelong training programmes benefit everyone. Regularly evaluating vocational training and subsidised job programmes, will improve their quality. Increasing the relative cost of short-term hiring and reforming the unemployment insurance system would reduce incentives for recurrent short-term employment periods and unemployment spells that weigh on the career prospects of low-skilled and younger workers. Continuing to reduce administrative barriers to entry and unduly restrictive regulations will raise competitive pressures and ensure favourable conditions for young and dynamic firms. Continuing to reduce the administrative burden could ease firm entry and growth. Moreover, entry and conduct regulations remain stringent in several professional services – such as accountants, notaries and pharmacists – weighing on productivity and employment. To ensure such regulations are in the public interest, reviewing existing regulations from a competition perspective would be helpful. Reducing the public spending-to-GDP ratio is needed to improve the fiscal position, and lower tax rates in the long run, particularly on labour. Government spending policies should focus on ensuring investment and social spending are better targeted to increase efficiency. Streamlining the tax system would also support economic activity. Reviewing some narrow-based low-revenue taxes that affect businesses would simplify the tax system. VAT exemptions and reduced rates are also sizeable and some of them benefit too little low-income households.

# How to Stop Annoying Your Customers With Useless CTAs and Instead Write CTAs That Convert

Sponsored by Emma In a world full of "READ THIS!" "BUY NOW!" and "CLICK HERE!" it's understandable that sometimes the only action customers want to take is a nap. And we, as marketers, can't really blame them, because most of us have experienced the frustration of tone-deaf brand messaging trying to boss us around.  No company sets out to annoy its target audience, but somewhere between brainstorming and execution, calls to action (CTAs) become covered with flashing popups, caps lock, red banners, and exclamation points... And before you know it, you've scared them all away.  So, what do we do? How are we to inspire action without sounding like a door-to-door salesman? Is there a way to write engaging content we're proud of that also helps us reach our business goals? Will our customers pay attention if we don't yell at them? What else is there to say other than "Buy now" or "Click here"?  To answer those questions, we have to get to the root of the disconnect between marketer and reader.  Your Biggest Need: To Drive Sales  There's no getting away from the goal of driving sales. No matter your marketing specialty or tactics, the bottom line is always to increase conversions and drive sales.  Though you're going to use many unique ways to get there—copy, images, and social media—and you'd like your goal to be something that speaks more to that creative brain of yours, you're in charge of business growth.  Your Underlying Need: To Gain Your Buyers' Trust  Keeping your customers' attention may seem like an obvious goal when you begin a campaign or project, and so you come up with catchy taglines or memorable stories, but the biggest mistake marketers make is checking this tactic at the door when writing CTAs.  It's likely you've already created a compelling argument or pitch for your product or brand, and the CTA is the one thing you need to drive it home and convert. But it's not actually that easy.  For some reason, as marketers, even if we create really incredible designs that point to the CTA, we're tempted to forgo everything we know about our brand identity and target audience as soon as it's time to craft the CTA.  We may write an extremely convincing commercial or print ad that engages viewers, only to follow it up with sales copy that's completely stale and unrelated.  Where the Mistake Happens  Imagine what would happen if you're out to dinner with a friend, you're having a really great time and connecting on a personal level, but at the end of the night she hands you a business card and tells you to call a 1-800 number if you'd like to hang out again. Weird, right?  That's what happens when we reuse CTAs instead of customizing them for each message.  Our mindset behind CTAs tends to be separate from our creativity, which is why we get it wrong. Instead, in the case of our example, think about what you'd expect a friend to say after a fun night out: "Hey, you know that movie we talked about? We should go see it next week!" or "I know you love Pad Thai; there's a great place in my neighborhood you need to try."  The magic is in the follow-up and follow-through: Simply continue the message you began with by allowing them to take action. What's the natural next step and how can you help them reach it?  See how We Transfer writes a personal note then ends with a simple "Tell me more." Not intimidating, but effective.  
Image: Really Good Emails Potential Customers' Biggest Need: To Make Smart Decisions  Studies suggest that a person makes more than 35,000 choices per day, on average. So when we talk about the decisions that are placed in front of a customer to make, they may not even realize they're doing it to begin with. These choices can be anything from what clothes to wear to how to solve an issue at work.  And more than likely, these decisions are influenced by something like moral instinct, others' opinions, or brand marketing. Sometimes, we may use Google to find where to buy an item we need or ask a friend about their favorite places to go, but a lot of the time, we make decisions on our own based on past experience, personal opinions, or general convenience.  The goal of marketing is to meet people at the crossroads of their decision-making to provide the information they need to complete a transaction.  See how Tovala's holiday email understands that its customers need to buy gifts in December, and the email makes that process easier with a few options:  
Image: Really Good Emails Their Underlying Need: To Feel Understood  When we meet customers in decision-making mode, they don't just want the answers and solutions your brand and product can provide them; they also want to feel heard and understood about the problems they face.  Knowing this goes back to knowing your audience and their pain points, which is something you're probably very familiar with in the product development or campaign planning stages, but you have to keep that customer mindset in mind all the way to the call to action.  Allow these CTA options from Would You Rather remind you that calls to action can be fun and interesting:  
Image: Really Good Emails How The Misinterpretation Happens  When you're writing your marketing messaging, don't put down your pen or keyboard before you write the CTA: Finish the thought you started. If we're thinking in terms of a real-life encounter, think about how you'd end an invitation to a friend.  It can be easy to view CTAs as the "obligatory copy" at the end of your marketing masterpiece, but it's really the one thing that stands between your brand and the customer. It's your one opportunity to prove that you're on their team, that you feel their pain, and that you will make their decision-making simple.  The best CTA isn't one that stands out. It's one that can be trusted.  The Root of the Misunderstanding  What's happening with ineffective CTAs is that marketers are simply trying to force their customers to make a decision that will end in a sale.  When ,really, you should be making your buyers feel understood and working to gain their trust.  Wrap-Up  Whether you're writing your first or your one-hundredth CTA, keep your messaging and audience in mind and you'll be able to write customized, interesting copy every time.

# You can't do a vision test from home in Indiana and go buy glasses. In 34 other states you can. Here's why.

Most states allow Visibly's online eye exam service. Indiana is not among them. Indianapolis Star In 34 states you don’t have to go to the eye doctor every time you want your prescription adjusted. Instead, you can undergo a vision test from your own home using your computer and phone. But the Hoosier state is not one of them. Indiana prohibits such use of telemedicine. That could change, however, if an eye health care technology company wins a lawsuit filed this week in Marion County Superior Court against the Indiana agencies that enforce the prohibition. The suit asks the court to rule that the law banning the technology is unconstitutional, which would pave the way for the company to start operating here. In 2016 when Indiana passed a law allowing for the practice of telemedicine, it specifically excluded using it for prescriptions for most opioids, abortion drugs and ophthalmic devices such as glasses or contact lenses. Now Visibly, a company that offers an online vision test, would like to change that. Lawyers for the Chicago-based company say that its technology makes eye exams more affordable and that prescriptions for eyewear have nothing in common with opioids and abortion drugs. “One of these is not like the others,” said Joshua Windham, lead attorney for the case and an attorney with the Institute of Justice, which describes itself as a public interest Libertarian law firm. “This has everything to do with protecting the financial interests of brick and mortar optometrists.” Opioid epidemic: Marion County kicks off needle exchange program The dispute marks the latest change in the eye-care industry as consumers and retailers increasingly look for opportunities online. While some eye doctors in other states have accepted the Visibly technology, much of the optometry profession in Indiana and elsewhere has pushed back. Indiana Optometry, the state affiliate of the American Optometric Association, does not support any means of vision prescription other than in-person prescribing, said Dr. Christopher Browning, the organization’s president. “With the current technology we don’t feel like it is appropriate because we feel that the technology is not up to par and it’s not the same as getting your eyes examined by an eye doctor,” said Browning, an optometrist at VisionQuest Eyecare in Greenwood. “It gives people a false sense of security that they have had an eye exam when in reality they have had a vision test on their phones.” An in-person exam with an optometrist goes beyond the classic eye chart, Browning said. The doctor also assesses the patient for early signs of a number of ocular diseases such as glaucoma or macular degeneration. In addition, through an eye exam a doctor may be able to diagnose the patient with other systemic conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Visibly officials, however, say that the tele-exam does not mean to replace a comprehensive eye exam. Patients must be healthy and between the ages of 22 and 55 to take the exam. A person cannot take the test more than three consecutive years, CEO Brent Rasmussen said. To take the $35 test, a person stands 10 feet away from an 11-inch or larger screen, such as on a laptop, computer or iPad, and uses a phone to answer the questions that appear on the computer screen. The test takes about 10 minutes and mimics the analysis done in an office with a phoropter, the many-lensed device patients look through that measures the refractive error of the eye. For fans of the eye doctor, this is not the Snellen eye chart, which measures for acuity by asking you to identify progressively smaller letters. Once the person completes the test, the results are forwarded to an optometrist or ophthalmologist who works in the same state where the person lives and is part of the Visibly network in that state. In most cases, that expert then writes a prescription for the Visibly client. About 30 percent of the time, however, the eye doctor reviewing the results will disqualify the patient, sending him or her an email strongly recommending a visit to an optometrist. “At the end of the day, Visibly is just a tool that doctors can use as a part of their practice,” Windham said. “The relationship is between you and the doctor who’s prescribing.” In states that allow Visibly to operate, eye doctors also can buy the technology to use in their practices. Since the online tool went live in 2014, under the name of Opternative, the optometry profession has pushed back. Two years later the American Optometric Association in a letter asked the Food and Drug Administration to investigate the company. The following year, the FDA in a letter to the company said Visibly was marketing its mobile app as a new medical device but it did not have approval or clearance to do so. In a September letter that the FDA posted on its website, Dr. Steven Lee, the optometrist who founded Visibly, said he had responded to the FDA’s concerns and worked closely with the agency. Indiana optometrist Browning said that he has not see any good external studies that verify the company’s technology and wonders whether it can do all it promises. “This is not necessarily good technology. … This is certainly not up to the standard of care I would want for my family,” he said. “This is not an eye exam. It is a novel way to check vision, and it is not standard.” Defendants in the lawsuit include the Medical Licensing Board of Indiana, the Indiana Professional Agency and Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill. The Indiana attorney general's office did not immediately respond Thursday morning to a request for comment regarding the Visibly lawsuit. A Senate bill this session, co-authored by Sens. Ed Charbonneau, R-Valparaiso, and Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, would have reversed the previous restriction, making it illegal for the Indiana Optometry Board to set standards for ocular telemedicine that are more restrictive than those that apply to an in-person practice. The bill did not make it out of the Senate Committee on Health and Provider Services. “Technology and innovation are making it easier and easier to connect with a doctor and get quality health care,” Windham said. “Visibly’s technology is an example of that, but sadly your ability to use that technology too often depends on where you live.”<end_of_turn>

# To-Do List: Gingrich Suspended, Whoopie Pies Disputed, Jews Off the Hook

To know: The Obama Administration is tempering its talk about possible military intervention in Libya. Hockey players may also be at risk for the degenerative brain disease that has been identified in deceased football players, according to an analysis of the brain tissue of hockey legend Bob Probert. (Read Ben McGrath on the N.F.L.’s concussion crisis.) And, flexing its newly Supreme Court-sanctioned right, Westboro Church has vowed to “quadruple” its number of protests at military funerals. To retire? Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh has tentatively agreed to a plan from opposition leaders that would require him to take steps to leave his position by the end of the year. To force some hands: Fox News, which has suspended Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum until May 1st, when their contracts will be terminated unless they announce that they are not running for President. Mike Huckabee and Sarah Palin, who also have Fox contracts, were not included on the suspension list. To let Jews off the hook: Pope Benedict XVI, who has written that they are not collectively to blame for the death of Jesus Christ. To fight for the whoopie pie: Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and the state of Maine, both of which claim it as a regional delicacy.<end_of_turn>

# Report: Tyeler Davison leaves Falcons without contract, will visit 49ers

New Orleans Saints free agent nose tackle Tyeler Davison visited the Atlanta Falcons but left without a contract, per Herbie Teope of NFL.com. Teope reports that Davison is flying to the West Coast to meet with the San Francisco 49ers as he continues to search for a new contract.  Davison was a fixture of the Saints defensive line for four years, ever since being drafted in 2015. He started 48 games and rarely missed an outing during that time. However, the Saints saw an opportunity to upgrade and signed former New England Patriots first round draft pick Malcom Brown in free agency. That put Davison on the search for a new team.  San Francisco could be a good fit for him. They have just four defensive tackles listed on their roster between starters DeForest Buckner and Arik Armstead, and backups Sheldon Day and D.J. Jones. They also added pass-rush specialist Dee Ford in a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs and project to select Ohio State Buckeyes prospect Nick Bosa with the second overall pick in this year’s draft. The 49ers mix up their fronts often and could use a true nose tackle like Davison, should he choose to sign there.<end_of_turn>

# IMF's Lagarde: Argentina would be 'foolish' to abandon reforms

Argentina's economic reform program is beginning to show results, so it would "foolish" for presidential candidates to abandon the program, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said Thursday. The crisis-hit South American giant, which has had a fractious relationship with the IMF over the years, has been trying to stabilize its economy with the help of an IMF-funded aid package, and will face presidential elections in late October. "We are now beginning to see the program actually work," Lagarde told reporters at the start of the IMF-World Bank spring meeting. "Our assessment is that the Argentine economy is at the point where it is going to bottom out." The IMF projects Argentina's economy will contract by 1.2 percent this year but will begin to grow in the second half of the year and that will be followed by an expansion of 2.2 percent in 2020. "Now that so much hard work has been done, in a program where social protection has always been one of our three key priorities, it would be foolish on the part of any candidate to turn their back to the work that is underway," Lagarde said. Argentina originally secured a $50 billion financing package from the IMF in June before returning to the fund to ask for more in October. The IMF granted an extra $6 billion and accelerated disbursements in exchange for tougher conditions. The government statistics bureau said the economy contracted 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2018, following a four percent drop in the second quarter, and plunged 7.5 percent in November alone.<end_of_turn>

# The Pollcast: Jason Kenney vs. Justin Trudeau | CBC News

The Pollcast: Jason Kenney vs. Justin Trudeau Vassy Kapelos and Aaron Wherry on the national implications of the Alberta election The polls say that Jason Kenney has a very good chance of becoming Alberta's next premier in Tuesday's provincial election. That would have a big impact on relations between Edmonton and Ottawa; it also could play a significant role in October's federal election. Rachel Notley, the incumbent premier and Alberta NDP leader, has had a delicate relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government — an ally on climate change and pension reform but an uneasy partner on pipelines. If relations between the two levels of government have become more difficult over time, they're likely to get even more combative if Kenney's United Conservatives win next week's vote. Not only has Kenney pledged to get rid of the province's carbon tax and lift the cap on greenhouse gas emissions for the oilsands, he has said he would hold a referendum on equalization if the federal government doesn't make any changes to the equalization formula. To discuss the potential implications of a Kenney premiership on the state of the federation and the Liberals' re-election strategy in October, Pollcast host Éric Grenier is joined by the CBC's Aaron Wherry and Vassy Kapelos, host of Power & Politics on CBC News Network.<end_of_turn>

# Former Vt. youth pastor admits exploiting teenage girl

BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) A former youth pastor at a Vermont Baptist church who admitted exploiting a teenage girl in a youth group will avoid jail time and not be placed on the sex offender registry if he stays out of trouble for the next five years.  The Burlington Free Press reports 29-year-old Michael McNeil, who now lives in Kentucky, pleaded guilty Friday to a misdemeanor charge of sexual exploitation of a minor.  McNeil's attorney says he is a "good man who made a terrible mistake."  The girl was older than the age of consent but younger than 18.  McNeil admitted that while in a position of power at the Williston church he enticed her to engage in sex acts. Under the law because of his position and being at least four years older, the relationship was nonconsensual.  (Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

# UN sets stage for end of peacekeeping in Haiti. A worried Dominican Republic objects

The United Nations Security Council on Friday renewed its justice-support peacekeeping mission in Haiti for a final six months, after which it will maintain only a special political mission in the crisis-ridden nation after Oct. 15.  Council members voted 13-0 in favor of the final six-month renewal, with the Russian Federation and Dominican Republic both abstaining. The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, called the withdrawal of peacekeepers in six months — as Haiti continues to face an ongoing political and economic crisis, deteriorating humanitarian conditions and State Department travel warning — premature.  “For the Dominican Republic [the peacekeeping mission] will come to an end at the same time we are expecting to see elections held in Haiti, a moment that can always fall into instability,” Ambassador José Singer Weisinger said. “We believe that we should weigh the moment and the conditions for this ... The work of this Security Council is to ensure that there is... international peace.” Haiti, which has a messy history with elections, is scheduled to hold legislative and local elections in October. Last week, during Security Council discussions on the situation in the country ahead of Friday’s vote, U.S. Acting Permanent Representative Jonathan Cohen stressed that the timing of the elections should not be a factor on when the peacekeeping mission ends.  “We do not believe this Council should link [the justice support peacekeeping mission’s] scheduled transition to legislative and local elections in Haiti scheduled for October 2019,“ Cohen said.  The United Nations first deployed a blue-helmeted peacekeeping force to Haiti in 2004, consisting of a large multinational military presence with soldiers from Brazil, Chile, Nepal and other nations. They steered Haiti through several hurricanes, tumultuous elections and a deadly 2010 earthquake.  In 2017, with a mixed legacy of controversy and stability, the Security Council began the withdrawal of the military soldiers but left foreign police officers to continue to provide support to the U.N.-trained Haiti National Police force. The smaller peacekeeping mission, which is now ending in October, focused on justice, human rights and police development.  In a brief statement on Friday, Cohen said the U.S. welcomes this final renewal of the peacekeeping mandate, and was mindful of the challenges ahead for Haiti. The country’s political actors, he added, need to engage in dialogue to find a lasting solution to the ongoing economic and political challenges.  Last month, following a series of tumultuous events including a 10-day lock down of the country in February by the opposition, the lower chamber of deputies fired the country’s prime minister, Jean Henry Céant, and his 21-member cabinet after only six months. The parliament has yet to vote on President Jovenel Moïse’s choice to replace Céant — former culture minister Jean Michel Lapin.  “This transition will mean a significant handover of responsibility into the hands of the Haitian government and its people,” Cohen said. “Now is the time for the government of Haiti to step up and assume its responsibility.”  For the most part, Security Council members have sought to provide a positive assessment of Haiti’s progress, with the United Nations’ help, over the last 15 years. Still, some nations remain nervous about what the lack of armed foreign police officers and armored vehicles may mean for the volatile country, which will now have to shoulder the burden of its own security.  “Haiti... has moved to a fully fledged political and economic crisis that has resulted since last July in a series of demonstrations and riots against the elevated cost of living, owing to inflation and the rapid depreciation of the local currency,” said European Union Ambassador João Vale de Almeida. The country has seen more than 200 demonstrations since December, with protesters demanding the resignation of the president and denouncing the management of PetroCaribe, Venezuela’s discounted oil program with Haiti, in which the savings were supposed to be invested in social programs.  “The EU is concerned about the general situation in Haiti, “ Vale de Almeida said, adding that he worries about the ability of the Haiti National Police to conduct effective operations after peacekeepers’ withdrawal. “The persistent inability of the Haitian National Police and national authorities to control gang-related violence, with accusations of collusion and other dysfunctions, is of particular concern.”    Still, Friday’s decision did not come as a surprise. Diplomats have hinted that there is Haiti fatigue in international circles, and Haitians cannot expect the mission to stay forever. Earlier this year, a U.N. delegation visited the country to help prepare the report, which U.N. Secretary General António Guterres presented to Council members with a slew of recommendations, including the creation of a special political mission to continue some of the peacekeepers’ justice and security initiatives.  “The transition to a political mission... must be carefully managed and objectives-based,” Canada’s Ambassador Marc-André Blanchard warned last week. “The objectives that have not been achieved by [the peacekeeping mission] should serve as a starting point for the special political mission. Reducing the United Nations presence must also be gradual and carefully sequenced to minimize any negative impact and preserve hard-won gains made since 2004.”  Jean-Pierre Lacroix, U.N. under-secretary-general for peace operations, said the U.N. remains concerned about the political volatility, institutional fragility and economic stagnation that have exacerbated social tensions and adversely affected the humanitarian situation in Haiti. But, he said, “we trust in the capacity of the Haitian National Police to manage security” without international support.  Acknowledging that “significant improvements” in the professionalism of the Haiti National Police, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said “incidents of serious human rights violations, including cases of summary executions, continue to be reported, with limited accountability.”  “The national police conducts administrative investigations into the majority of allegations, yet judicial proceedings are rarely initiated against the alleged perpetrators,” she said. “In 2018, only 12 percent of cases of confirmed human rights violations were prosecuted, and no judicial measures were taken in the most emblematic cases. Perpetrators are consequently emboldened.”  While the special political mission will need to address these troubling human rights challenges, along with corruption and social grievances, Loune Viaud, the executive director of a Haitian nongovernmental organization, Zanmi Lasante, said the urgent humanitarian needs of women and girls, including sexual and reproductive health services for gender-based violence survivors, must also be addressed with the U.N.’s future presence.  “Watching a woman die because she reached us too late; seeing families devastated after losing a mother, a wife, or a daughter in childbirth are images one cannot forget,” Viaud said, noting that cancer is also an issue that primarily affects women in Haiti. “Childbirth should not be a death sentence in Haiti... No woman should die in Haiti because of lack of access to obstetric care or cancer.”<end_of_turn>

# Make a Will to aid hospice

Solicitors in Wetherby are supporting Martin House Hospice Care for Children and Young People by taking part in its Make a Will Month initiative.  Hartlaw LLP and Ware and Kay Solicitors in Wetherby, along with Switalskis in Boston Spa, are joining forces with the hospice this May. They are giving people the chance to make or update a basic will at a reduced rate throughout May – just £60 for a single will or £110 for a pair of matching wills. Lucy Pickford, head of fundraising at Martin House, said: “It’s not always easy to think about making your will – in fact 60 per cent of adults in the UK haven’t made theirs. “Our Make a Will Month gives you the chance to provide for the people and causes you care about at a discounted rate. “While there is no obligation to leave a gift to Martin House, we are incredibly grateful for any legacies people choose to leave us, as they will help us to continue to care for families who need our support for generations to come.” Martin House cares for children and young people with life-shortening conditions across West, North and East Yorkshire, and provides support for the whole family. Its care includes respite stays, community visits, end of life care and bereavement support. It costs more than £8 million a year to run Martin House, and legacies in wills make up around a quarter of Martin House’s annual voluntary income, meaning it funds one in four children receiving care. Lucy added: “We’d like to thank all our partner solicitors for supporting us during Make a Will Month by offering this special rate.” To take advantage of Make a Will Month, make an appointment with a participating solicitor during May, and complete an entitlement voucher.

# Bernhard Langer leads the way for older stars at the Masters

Bernhard Langer and Sandy Lyle lead the way for older stars at the Masters and prove why lifetime exemption for former champions is good value The lifetime exemption for former Masters champions still divides opinion Bernhard Langer is holding his own at Augusta on day two of the Masters Fellow veteran Sandy Lyle finished on a four over par 36 hole score after a 74 The lifetime exemption for former Masters champions continues to divide opinion, with some past winners clearly abusing the privilege and staying on long past their sell-by dates. Against that, it's not hard to understand the obvious pleasure that performers like Bernhard Langer and Sandy Lyle bring in holding back the years, to the considerable number of patrons who are about the same age. Langer, in particular, might be the most remarkable performer in the entire sport. In 228 events on the Champions Tour for the over 50s set, he's missed just three halfway cuts, so it's perhaps not surprising he's more than holding his own here. Bernhard Langer showed why it is good value to have lifetime exemption for former champions After shooting 71 at the age of 61 in the first round, the German birdied the 18th hole on Thursday for a 72 to give him an under par halfway total of 143. Alongside him, the highly rated young Englishman Matt Wallace - 33 years younger than Langer - needed nine shots more. What an education this must have been for the Londoner. One of the highlights of the tournament to date must have been the manner in which Langer broke par in the opening round. His hopes appeared to be literally going down the toilet when his wild drive at the 18th finished in a temporary W.C. In 228 events on the Champions Tour for over 50s set, Langer missed just three halfway cuts Fellow veteran Sandy Lyle finished day one on a four over par 36 hole score after a 74 His second shot, following a free drop, clipped a tree. From 200 yards he found the back of the green and then produced one of the loudest roars of the day when he holed from 20ft for the best par of the tournament to date. Typical Langer. The two-time former champion, who won his titles way back in 1985 and 1993, came out the next day and holed another 20 footer to birdie the first. He was now two under and placed inside the top 15. It was getting ridiculous, before he finally started acting something like his age, by dropping three shots in a six hole spell from the fifth. Would he fade away? That's hardly Langer is it? Never mind that this hilly course takes it out of everyone by the end. Langer birdied three of the last five holes for his eye-opening halfway total. Lyle, meanwhile, finished on a four over par 36 hole score after a 74, leaving him on the projected halfway cut line. What a shot in the arm the pair have given to golfers everywhere of a certain age.<end_of_turn>

# Netflix Chief Set To Leave Facebook’s Board Of Directors

Netflix Chief Set To Leave Facebook’s Board Of Directors  Netflix chief Reed Hastings will depart Facebook’s board of directors at the end of next month, according to a Friday filing with US regulators by the leading social network. Neither Hastings nor businessman and political figure Erskine Bowles, who have been on the board since 2011, will be nominated for re-election at an annual shareholders meeting on May 30, Facebook said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Hastings’ departure comes as the social network prioritizes services such as live streaming and on-demand video that compete with Netflix. Facebook said it had nominated PayPal core markets senior vice president Peggy Alford to join its board, making the tech industry veteran the first African-American woman to join its ranks. “Peggy is one of those rare people who’s an expert across many different areas — from business management to finance operations to product development,” Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in the filing. “I know she will have great ideas that help us address both the opportunities and challenges facing our company.” Facebook’s board members include Zuckerberg, investor Marc Andreessen, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, and Peter Thiel of the Founders Fund. “What excites me about the opportunity to join Facebook’s board is the company’s drive and desire to face hard issues head-on while continuing to improve on the amazing connection experiences they have built over the years,” Alford said in the filing. Facebook has been grappling with questions over its handling of personal data of its more than two billion users and protects against — as well as concerns the social network is used to spread misinformation and abuse.

# Lunch menu, school newspaper uncovered after elementary school opens 30-year-old time capsule

HORRY COUNTY, SC (WMBF) – Forestbrook Elementary School students took a blast back to the past as they opened a 30-year-old time capsule.  It was hiding behind a brick of the building.  But school officials ran into a few problems when it came to opening up the time capsule. It was sealed air tight so they had to bring in a hammer and bolt cutters to pry the capsule open.  Once it was opened, school officials found a lunch menu, writing samples, a school newspaper and a class roster.  “Forestbrook Elementary has a long tradition here of academic excellence and to be able to come here as principal now is an honor for me,” said Principal Marshall Hursey. “I was glad a lot of former teachers and administrators were able to come back today and be a part of this. They were the ones that got us started, laid the foundation for what we have today for Forestbrook Elementary School.”  Students are already collecting items for the next time capsule.<end_of_turn>

# Fifth column: An election diary

Last week I went back to Jayapur. This is one of the villages that Narendra Modi adopted when he was elected from Varanasi. I was last here three years ago. It looked then just like the other squalid little villages that surround it. But, the main road was in the process of being paved. And, there was a new bank with an ATM. Outside the bank I met a young girl with blow-dried hair who said she had just completed her training as a beautician and asked if I could find her a job. She took my number and called me a couple of times but I was unable to help. Hopefully someone else helped.  When I returned to Jayapur, the first thing I noticed was that the road is now pucca and a second bank has opened. The other thing I noticed was that compared to the villages I had driven through on my way from Varanasi, there were definite signs that Swachh Bharat had made an impact. No drains clogged with plastic. No rotting garbage.  The pradhan of Jayapur, Srinarain Patel, lives in a large two-storied house. When I asked what changes the village had seen since Modi adopted it, he said the village had been transformed. “We have two banks, a post-office, piped water in our homes, 22 hours of electricity, there are toilets in every house. But the journey of development is unending so we would now like to see more paved roads in the village.”  Later, I talked to other residents of Jayapur and can report that I did not hear the word Hindutva mentioned once. There is more Hindutva on Twitter than in rural India, and those who plan to vote for Modi again say that it is because he has delivered on ‘vikas’.  In the cities I have met many more people who feel let down by Modi. I have met very unhappy traders and small businessmen who have not fully recovered from the double shock of demonetisation and GST. But, in the words of a jeweller who was once an ardent Modi supporter, “I don’t want to vote for him this time because of the losses that my business has suffered in the past five years, but then I look at the alternatives and I think I might have to leave this country if one of those others come to power.”  There are many former believers in Modi who have lost faith in him, and their reasons for losing faith are economic. The World Bank may rank India as a country that has become one in which it is easier to do business, but on the ground this appears somehow to have got lost in translation. Luckily for Modi, even those who say they are disappointed with the absence of real change in their lives in the past five years, say that they feel compelled to vote for him because the alternative frightens them.  This is with the exception of Muslims. On my travels I have made it a point to seek them out, and to a man they believe that if Modi wins again, he will ensure that there is a Hindu Rashtra soon, in which they will live as inferior citizens. Last week, the BJP president appeared to confirm this by announcing plans to keep out Muslim ‘infiltrators’ and allow in only Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists. When I tweeted that he should explain what he meant, I was attacked both by those who love Modi and those who hate him.  Twitter is the battlefield for Hindutva warriors and Hindutva haters. In the real India, what matters are economic issues. Indian voters, whatever their caste or creed, seem more economically aspirational than they ever have been in the past. This is a good thing. We might one day see an election in which caste and creed no longer matter.  What I personally found most reassuring is that I met nobody on my travels who believes that Hindutva is the reason for Modi’s popularity. It is easy in Delhi and Mumbai to be fooled by ‘intellectuals’ into believing that Hindutva is the only reason for Modi remaining popular, but travel outside these cloistered environs and another reality becomes evident. After the Balakot attack there was for a brief moment an upsurge in aggressive nationalism. This moment seems to have passed.  What is important for Modi to remember if he becomes prime minister again next month is that many of the good things he has done are forgotten because of the hate that some of his closest associates have been allowed to spread.  What he needs to remember also is that he himself once promised that he would be the leader of all Indians with his slogan of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’. This is a promise that remains unfulfilled.

# Millionaire Shoreham crash pilot given £170,000 legal aid

Families' fury as millionaire Shoreham air crash pilot who was cleared over the deaths of 11 men was given £170,000 legal aid for his court case Andrew Hill's jet exploded on the A27 killing 11 at the Shoreham Airshow in 2015 Mr Hill, 54, was found not guilty of 11 counts of gross negligence manslaughter The ex-BA pilot, worth millions, received £170,000 worth of legal aid Victim's relatives were initially denied legal aid for the inquest, applying in 2017 The victim's relatives want to see the evidence go before an inquest jury Andrew Hill's Hawker Hunter jet exploded crashed on the A27 following a botched loop-the-loop attempt at the Shoreham Air Show on August 22 2015 A pilot who was cleared of manslaughter after his plane crashed and killed 11 people at the Shoreham Air Show received legal aid while the victim's relatives were denied support. Andrew Hill, 54, was revealed to have received £170,000 of government funding as families of the deceased were forced to battle for aid for the inquest after initially being denied. Families of the victims from the West-Sussex disaster were granted legal aid after a two year battle with the Legal Aid Agency and many MPs begging Theresa May on their behalf. Andrew Hill's Hawker Hunter jet exploded crashed on the A27 following a botched loop-the-loop attempt at the event on August 22 2015. Mr Hill was found not guilty of 11 counts of gross negligence manslaughter at his trial at the Old Bailey in London last month. The ex-BA pilots legal aid funding, which is expected to cost up to £300,000 by the end of the seven week court trial, was revealed in a freedom of information act carried out by The Sunday Mirror. Hazel Jones, the mother of personal trainer Matt Jones, 24, who died along side his friend Daniele Polito in Mr Hill's Hawker Hunter jet explosion spoke out after hearing the news last night. She told The Sunday Mirror: 'It's absolutely horrendous.' Adding: 'It was a build-up over three and a half years but we're trying not to get too concerned with all things surrounding the case. Shoreham air disaster victim Matt Jones. The personal trainer died in the Shoreham Airshow crash, when a Hawker Hunter jet ploughed into the A27 at Shoreham in West Sussex Speaking about the impact that her son's death and the following legal battle had had on the family she said: 'On the day of the verdict my husband had a stroke.' Represented by Stewarts Law firm the relatives of the victims initially applied for legal funding in March 2017 - but were denied by the government who said their was no 'public interest' in supporting the families. This decision was then criticised by Shoreham's MP Tim Loughton in parliament - with relatives only receiving the financial support earlier this year. The Legal Aid Agency called their decision to fund the families after their initial refusal 'exceptional and complex case funding'. Compensation settlements are believed to have been reached between aircraft provider Canfield Hunter Ltd and the families. At a pre-inquest hearing lawyers acting for the victim's families say relatives want to see the evidence go before an inquest jury. The stretch of the A27 became a fireball after the plane slammed down minutes into the show If the move is given the green light by West Sussex coroner, Penelope Schofield, then Mr Hill may be called to give evidence on his his role in the tragedy, before the victims' families and a jury once again. Jim Morris, who represents the family of Matthew Grimstone, said: 'It is my submission this inquest should have a jury. 'This aviation disaster was a notifiable incident and again there are going to be similar issues.' He said the actions of the pilot would be reassessed once again - including video footage of the disaster. Mr Morris said: 'It is appropriate is to treat it with the gravitas it deserves and hear it with a jury.' Gerard Forlin QC, who represents the families of six victims, called for a 'full, frank and fearless' inquest into the tragedy and said all the evidence should be put before a jury. He said a jury would be able rule on a number of possible conclusions and he did not agree that accidental death was the only possible outcome of the inquest into the August 2015 disaster. The pre-inquest hearing was told video footage of the tragedy which was made available for the trial would have to be sought once again. Handout file videograb issued by Sussex Police and the Crown Prosecution Office showing the jet Mr Hill was flying moments before the crash It is hoped the full inquest will take place in West Sussex later this year or early next year. Eleven men were killed in the incident. Mr Hill Hill, who was thrown from the cockpit wreckage, was seriously injured and told medics he had 'blacked out'. He spent months convalescing and was charged with 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence which he denied. At his trial Mr Hill of Sandon, Buntingford, Hertfordshire the prosecution claimed he had a 'cavalier attitude' to safety and had previously taken unnecessary risks during airshows. They said he was flying too low and too slow to be able to be able to safely execute the loop manoeuvre. But his defence team claimed he had been affected by the G Forces which had caused a subtle 'cognitive impairment' related to hypoxia and the jury returned unanimous not guilty verdicts. Speaking outside the Old Bailey following the verdict, Mr Hill read out the names of those who died and said: 'I'm truly sorry for the part I played in their deaths.' After the trial the families of the victims spoke outside court and said they felt 'let down by the justice system'. Leslye Polito, who lost her son Daniele in the crash, said: 'I feel extremely disappointed, very upset and primarily let down by the justice system when someone who has clearly made some very bad errors of judgment is allowed to walk free.'<end_of_turn>

# Opinion: Use Ecosia, the search engine that plants trees

By Donovan Levine 
Contributing Writer If you’ve never heard of Ecosia, it is an internet search engine exactly like Google or Bing that uses the revenue generated by ads and website traffic, measured by user searches, to plant trees in deforested areas. Founded in Berlin, Germany, in 2009, the website has promised 80 percent of all its surplus goes to different “go green” non-profits.  As someone who uses this alternative search engine as a default, I’ve been nothing short of impressed by it. The results generated are on par with Google’s and they keep track of every single search you’ve entered in the top right corner of the website, called the “Counter.”  For every 45 searches, one tree is planted. On their homepage, they keep a count of how many trees have been planted to date, which right now is sitting at 53.8 million trees altogether.  To dedicated users like myself, they send emails, videos and updates about the work they’ve done so far, showing their company’s teams taking various trips to places like Brazil, Burkina Faso, Tanzania and several other regions where deforestation has taken place. Time lapses of these regions over the course of just ten years show the impact humans have had on the environment.  Their homepage also depicts a map of every location they’ve planted trees. Their blogs share the stories of the work Ecosia has done thus far, including partnering with Kenya’s Green Belt Movement and the High Atlas Foundation in Morocco.  Years ago, someone tried discrediting Ecosia as a hoax, but since then the company’s responded by posting their financial reports and tree receipts monthly so consumers can hold them accountable. They also promise not to sell our data to advertisers. Both of these actions demonstrate their promise to be as transparent as possible.  They also collect money from fundraisers and merchandise like most other non-profits. They sell shirts online for about €22.50, around $25, and have 20 trees planted for every shirt purchased.  Ecosia Inc. considers themselves a social business but at the same time a global community actively fighting the various problems destroying our planet’s soil and safety collectively known as climate change. Approximately seven million people use Ecosia now as their default browser, which of course falls short of the global population, seven billion.  It’s an innovative resource that’s hardly talked about at all but is of no cost for anyone. All it takes is a simple search just like using Google. It takes perfect advantage of the informational age we live in, combining conscious with commerce as the experts say, and providing perhaps the easiest way for anyone across the globe to contribute to the reforestation of our earth from home.  Without having to donate, without having to plant anything yourself and without most of what other non-profits like Greenpeace will advocate, as long as you have internet access, you can help the planet. That’s Ecosia’s promise.  In light of the 49th celebrated Earth Day coming up around the corner, it wouldn’t hurt to visit ecosia.org, download the app, set it as your default browser and go green.<end_of_turn>

# View Linna Marder's Obituary on Tallahassee.com and share memories

Linna Ward Marder Tallahassee - Linna Ward Marder was born on April 16, 1945 in Orlando, Florida, to Earl G. and Elizabeth W. Ward. As a young girl she loved reading, playing cards, corralling her two younger sisters, and taking care of the family cat. She attended Winter Park High School, followed by Emory University, where she graduated in 1967 with a major in sociology. During her college years, she became keenly interested in social justice, and she joined the Peace Corps upon graduation. She trained with a large contingent of volunteers (including several lifelong friends-to-be) at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico and shipped off to Korea, where she provided health care services for two years in the village of Pyung Dong. After her Korean adventure, she moved to San Francisco, where she worked at the University of the Pacific Dental School. At a fateful dinner party one night, she met a charming young architect named Walter. They were married four months later, on September 30, 1972 at St. Mary the Virgin Episcopal Church in San Francisco. Photographic evidence shows that the wedding was a riotous success, from the bride's family heirloom dress to the wedding cake home-baked in batches and kept in the freezer at the Chinese grocery down the block. The young couple spent two years in San Francisco, living with some friends in a rambling Victorian house, before heading to Belize for another two-year Peace Corps stint. There they lived in a tiny house at the edge of the jungle, using a machete to keep the garden clear. Linna worked at the library at Belmopan Comprehensive School and at a hospital and daycare. In 1976 they moved back to the U.S. and settled in Wilmington, Delaware, where they welcomed their son Andrew in 1980. A career change brought the family to Tallahassee, Florida, where their daughter Monica was born in 1986. While raising her children, Linna also managed to earn a master's degree in Library Science from FSU, and she worked as a reference librarian for 23 years at the Leon County Library branches downtown and in Northeast Tallahassee. She retired in 2012 and turned her attention to crossword puzzles, mystery books, relaxing at Cape San Blas, and traveling - visiting Andrew in London and DC, Monica in San Francisco and NYC, two transatlantic cruises, and a return to Korea, where she reunited with her Peace Corps host family and marveled at the changes in the country. Linna passed away peacefully, surrounded by her family, on April 6, 2019. She will be remembered for her wit, her hospitality, and her generosity. She always gave of herself to others, whether it was her time, her knowledge, or her cooking (family and friends will always miss her annual New Year's open house and forgotten cookies.) She leaves behind her a lifetime of love and her surviving family members: husband Walter of Tallahassee; son Andrew, daughter-in-law Alexandria, and grandson Maxwell of Hyattsville, Maryland; daughter Monica and son-in-law Graham Sutton of Hoboken, New Jersey; sister Ann and brother-in-law Houston Wheeler of Atlanta, Georgia; sister Celia and brother-in-law Mark Broadhead of Crestview, Florida; and several nieces and nephews. Walter wishes to extend particular thanks to Taydra Eaddy and Kimberley Crumbie from Visiting Angels of Tallahassee, and the staff of the VNICU at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, for their kindness to Linna. There will be a memorial service at the Episcopal Church of the Advent on Piedmont Road at 2:00 pm on Friday, May 17. The family asks for donations to a in lieu of flowers.<end_of_turn>

# Countdown's Rachel Riley flaunts famous derriere in thigh-skimming dress

The blonde bombshell flaunted her famous behind in the skimpy ensemble, as the short hemline highlighted her long legs. Rachel's curve-hugging dress clung to her figure as the criss-cross design down her side showed off her hourglass proportions. It didn't take long for viewers to compliment Rachel on her racy choice, as one posted: "Best body on Channel 4." Another added: "You look amazing." A third chipped in: "So stunning." A fourth wrote: "Absolutely beautiful." Meanwhile, Rachel shared her excitement for the return of Game of Thrones, which came back to screens last night. She uploaded a picture of her sat on the Iron Throne surrounded by candles as she donned a clingy white lace dress with a pink floral pattern on her neckline. Rachel captioned the snap: "I know what I’m doing tonight!!!! Finally, it’s time…!" It has since been revealed one billion people tuned in to watch the season eight premiere as it was aired in 170 different countries. The hit show only has six episodes this season, but each instalment is feature length, as the story finally concludes. Countdown continues tomorrow at 2.10pm on Channel 4.<end_of_turn>

# No police inquiry into tourism boss

No police investigation into tourism boss expenses  Police will not carry out their own investigation into expenses claims made by the former chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire. Sir Gary Verity paid back £40,000 before resigning on health grounds last month. West Yorkshire Police said it would await the findings of an independent investigation commissioned by the tourism company. Lib Dem peer Lord Scriven said he was "astounded" by the force's decision. Last month the former leader of Sheffield City Council wrote to the chief constable of West Yorkshire, asking for the force to investigate expenses claims made by Sir Gary. A force spokesman said that following a meeting with Welcome to Yorkshire representatives it had agreed the full findings of an independent review will be shared with the force. It added that if any evidence was identified of criminal offences it would be brought to their "immediate attention". Responding to the decision, Lord Scriven said the force had "taken at face value the word of the very organisation who have overseen the poor governance and financial control that has led to at least £40,000 being claimed when it shouldn't have. "I feel the force haven't carried out their duties in full and I will now consider referring this matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct." Earlier this month, Welcome to Yorkshire announced it would commission two independent investigations into Sir Gary's tenure at the company, which has received millions of pounds of public funding. At the time of his resignation, it said Sir Gary resigned on health grounds but an investigation found he had "made errors of judgement regarding his expenses". Responding to the claim he repaid £40,000 in expenses before quitting, a spokeswoman for Sir Gary said: "Expenses were submitted in the ordinary course and signed off. "However, on review it was agreed that some errors had been made and Sir Gary was content to agree to voluntarily reimburse Welcome to Yorkshire for monies owed."<end_of_turn>

# Charles and Camilla to visit Germany

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are to make a four-day visit to Germany in May, Clarence House has announced. The visit, on behalf of the British Government, will “demonstrate the depth and breadth of the UK–Germany bilateral relationship and its enduring importance to both countries”, Clarence House has said. Charles’ household added: “The visit will highlight key themes in this relationship, as well as our shared history and cultural connections.” The heir to the throne will meet Germany’s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during the trip which is the latest in a string of visits, dubbed “Brexit diplomacy”, the royal family have made to Europe as the UK leaves the EU. Charles and Camilla’s trip, from May 7-10, will see them visit the cities of Berlin, Leipzig and Munich. The couple will begin their tour of Germany in the capital where the prince will meet the president and that evening Charles and his wife will be guests of honour at the Queen’s birthday party, an annual event hosted by the British Ambassador, Sir Sebastian Wood, at his residence. The following day in Leipzig the prince and duchess will explore the city’s cultural heritage and learn about the role its people played in the “Peaceful Revolution” that helped bring about the reunification of Germany in 1989. Charles and Camilla will spend the remaining days of their visit in Munich carrying out a series of engagements that reflect the themes of the tour. The prince will focus on partnerships for green growth, sustainable organic produce and economic co-operation while the duchess will meet women who have suffered domestic abuse as part of her commitment to support victims of domestic violence in the UK and overseas. Markus Soeder, minister president of Bavaria, will host a dinner for the couple at the Munich Residenz, a former royal palace, attended by key figures from politics, business, culture, science and education. Charles and Camilla will end their visit with a celebration of local produce at an organic farm, which was established to preserve traditional agriculture and crafts. The prince has visited Germany more than 30 times, both publicly and privately, while the duchess made her first official visit to the country in 2009 with her husband.<end_of_turn>

# Ex-soldier to be charged with 1972 murder

Daniel Hegarty: Ex-soldier to be charged with 1972 murder  A former soldier is to be charged with murdering a teenager, who was shot twice in the head in Londonderry during the Northern Ireland Troubles. Fifteen-year-old Daniel Hegarty was killed in an Army operation near his home in the Creggan in July 1972. Last year, the High Court ruled a decision not to prosecute, taken in 2016, was based on "flawed" reasoning. The Army veteran, known as Soldier B, will also face a second charge of wounding the teenager's cousin. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Herron, informed the Hegarty family of developments at a private meeting. He conducted a review of the case following the court ruling. Mr Herron said he believed the evidence "is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction". In reaching the decision, he added that he had taken Soldier B's ill health into consideration. An inquest in 2011 found Daniel Hegarty posed no risk and was shot without warning as the Army moved in to clear "no-go" areas during Operation Motorman. His cousin, Christopher Hegarty, 17, was also shot in the head by the same soldier, but survived. In respect of the older youth, Soldier B will face a charge of wounding with intent.<end_of_turn>

# A New Tool Developed At FAU Is Measuring Knowledge Of Alzheimer's Disease In Rural Areas

Alzheimer’s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S., impacting an estimated 5.8 million Americans who currently live with the disease. Many of them are 65 and older and live in places with limited access to health care and education, which heightens the risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Florida Atlantic University has a new 32-question survey tool called "Basic Knowledge of Alzheimer's Disease," that is working to gauge Floridians' knowledge about the disease and help connect them to resources. Dr. Lisa Wiese, assistant professor at Florida Atlantic University’s C. E. Lynn College of Nursing, recently received a grant from the Association of Community Health Nursing Educators and the Florida Department of Health to conduct the survey in rural communities. It has already been tested in Belle Glade and Pahooke. Wiese joined Sundial to talk about the survey.  WLRN: What is the challenge in reaching people in some of the rural parts of the country, especially here in Florida? WIESE: In rural areas we know that we have less providers. The transportation to get to providers, especially specialty providers, is very difficult. We often see this disconnect between people who are at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease in rural populations and getting them to these providers. What's your interest in understanding and helping people with this disease? My mother passed from Alzheimer's disease at almost age 98. I'm from West Virginia Appalachian area, but she was very fortunate that her primary provider recognized her symptoms immediately and put her on medications. We do know that an earlier start to medication, therapy and lifestyle changes can make a big difference in how effective those are. So she actually never progressed in her illness much beyond the extreme short-term memory loss that people experience. And that motivated me to try to help other people in rural areas who don't often have access. The tool that you're working on helps one to find out what people know but also to help them get that information. How does that work? This tool is available for anyone who wants to use it and it's also been translated into Creole and Spanish. It's been piloted and tested and you could take that into your community setting, senior living, churches, wherever you have a gathering of adults and find out what they know and don't know. Then we do education and correct myths. What are some of the communities you're looking at? First, I started in the rural areas of Florida and around the Glades region. And then once we had a defined version of the knowledge measure then we went to five different counties in five different states in rural areas such as Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia and so on. What have you learned so far? One thing in rural areas is that community is everything. So they have a real compassion for helping each other and they want education and they want to be included in research and what's going on. This is a whole area that we could tap into. Most of these rural residents do have a primary provider that they have a strong relationship with and that they feel confident in going to see regularly. What is not happening is that they are not being tested for memory loss. There is no cognitive screening going on even though if you asked the provider or the participants if they wanted to be screened an overwhelming 88 percent wanted to be screened, but it's not happening because either the provider is too busy or they think they can't manage the illness if they do detect it. And what's the next step in this research? The next step is getting providers to the rural areas, policy changes, rewarding practitioners for being out in the rural areas and also empowering people to reach clinics through transportation, through shared rides, through free Uber or whatever it would be to get people to those clinics.<end_of_turn>

# Bernie Sanders’ Last 10 Years Of Tax Returns Show He’s Now Among The Millionaires

BETHLEHEM, Pa. — Bernie Sanders grew up in a three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn. His father, a paint salesman, "worked hard his entire life, but never made much money." In the 1970s, as a young candidate in Vermont, he borrowed gas money from friends to campaign in his Volkswagen bug. The windshield wipers didn't work. He struggled to pay bills. In 1981, after his inauguration as mayor of Burlington, he bought his first suit. Decades later, as a two-time presidential candidate and celebrity, he talks often about his years living "paycheck to paycheck." Unlike Donald Trump, he says, "I know what that is about." Now tax returns from the last ten years, released for the first time by his campaign aides on Monday, show how much Sanders has risen, and profited, from national politics in the three years since an improbable presidential campaign made him one of the most popular politicians in America. According to copies of the returns, Sanders earned more than $2.7 million from 2016 through 2018 — an income that puts him among the ranks of the "millionaires and billionaires" he has railed against for years. “These tax returns show that our family has been fortunate," Sanders said in a statement on Monday. "I am very grateful for that, as I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck and I know the stress of economic insecurity. That is why I strive every day to ensure every American has the basic necessities of life, including a livable wage, decent housing, health care and retirement security. I consider paying more in taxes as my income rose to be both an obligation and an investment in our country.” Outside his annual salary from the US Senate, book contracts and sales account for Sanders' primary source of income. His returns also show more than $106,000 in income for a forthcoming book by Sanders’ wife, Jane Sanders. The book will be published by St. Martin’s Press, an aide said. According to his campaign, the Sanders family donated 3.4% of their 2018 adjusted gross income to charities that benefit senior centers, low-income organizations, educational entities, and environmental and housing advocacy groups. In 2018, Sanders’ adjusted gross income was $561,293. He paid a 26% effective tax rate. Sanders made the release at the tail end of a four-day, five-state tour through the Midwest, where his campaign is working to sway Rust Belt voters away from Trump. At a series of rallies and small town halls over the weekend, the senator cast the president as a false messenger on trade policy — "for once in your life,” he said at a rally in Michigan this weekend, “keep your campaign promises” — and spoke about his own working-class roots. Sanders has resisted questions about his tax returns since his 2016 campaign, even as he criticized Trump for withholding his own from the public. (During that race, he released just his 2014 returns, which showed a family income of about $205,000.) On the trail and in interviews with the press, the senator bristles at questions about his personal income and wealth. On Friday in Gary, Indiana, after touring a downtown left empty by a faltering steel industry, Sanders volunteered to take questions from the press during a meeting with community leaders. "You're a millionaire yourself now," a Daily Mail reporter noted. "Does that conflict with the message that you're pushing here today?" "I don't think so," Sanders replied from the front of the room. "I didn't know that it was a crime to write a good book. My view has always been that we need a progressive tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country finally start sharing their fair share in taxes. If I make a lot of money, you make a lot of money." "I don't apologize for writing a book that was no. 3 on the New York Times bestseller, translated into five or six languages..." "How's that?" Sanders said as the audience laughed. "And by the way — by the way — this bothers me a little bit. Maybe we might want to talk about Gary, Indiana." The subject was also at the heart of a public rift between the Sanders campaign and a prominent Washington-based liberal think, the Center for American Progress, which runs the left-leaning news outlet, ThinkProgress. After the site published a critical story and video about Sanders' wealth, Sanders accused the organization of sponsoring a "smear" campaign against progressive presidential candidates, as first reported by the New York Times. “This counterproductive negative campaigning needs to stop,” Sanders wrote in a letter to the group's board. "The Democratic primary must be a campaign of ideas, not of bad-faith smears. Please help play a constructive role in the effort to defeat Donald Trump.” Although Sanders' income puts him in the top tier of American earners, the returns were, in fact, largely what you'd expect from a 77-year-old politician and his wife of some 30 years — bucking weeks of speculation among skeptical Democrats, including former Clinton aides, that Sanders was squirrely about the release because it would reveal nefarious activity by him or his wife in the years since his campaign made the name one of the popular in American politics. The tax returns show that Jane Sanders made no income from the nonprofit she founded after the 2016 campaign, the Sanders Institute. (The policy-focused think tank is scheduled to shut down sometime in May in an effort to avoid potential conflicts of interest.) The Sanders family appeared to profit from a “small antiques business” in 2012 and 2013, according to the returns. A campaign aide did not respond to comment about the business. “Not being a billionaire, not having investments in Saudi Arabia, wherever he has investments," Sanders said last week in a reference to the president, "mine will be a little bit more boring."<end_of_turn>

# Bernie Sanders’ Fox News Town Hall – Open Thread

The Fox News town hall with Bernie Sanders begins at 6:30 PM ET today. What do you all think about it? Share thoughts and observations before, during and after in our comments section. I was somewhat ambivalent when I first posted about Sanders doing a town hall on Fox, on April 4:  I think it’s quite possible for him to do well though I hate to see him give undeserved cred to Fox News. My hope is he publicly recognizes the fact that the network is his electoral foe as much as Trump.  But since then, Fox has proven that it’s on a campaign to dangerously smear Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), with an eye toward using her to damage all Democrats, deliberately tried to scare viewers into thinking Democrats will destroy the country and more.  So why is Sanders doing an event that will give Fox News undeserved credibility and probably serve as fodder for attacking him after the fact? Sanders is currently leading or near the top of the pack of Democratic rivals. How many Democratic primary voters will he reach via this town hall? Why not wait until after he secures the nomination (if he secures the nomination) to go fishing for votes among Fox viewers?  As I said in my last post, I’m adamantly in favor of Democrats appearing on Fox but not in such a way as to give Fox undeserved prestige as a legitimate news operation. Sanders could easily do a series of interviews on Fox. I’m sure either or both of the town hall hosts, Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier, would host him on their shows. Why not go that route instead of taking part in a kabuki theater of public questions that Fox will almost surely script against him?  But since it’s all but a done deal, it’s my hope that Bernie will at least confront Fox News over the hate mongering and propaganda it spews and not just play along.  Unfortunately, my internet has been out all day (I’m writing and posting this from the library, which will close soon). I do not know when my service will be restored. But I will be watching and recording the event and hope to post about it either later tonight or tomorrow.  You can watch the Bernie Sanders town hall from 6:30-7:30 either on TV or online if you have the right television-provider subscription. If Fox News had any true public spirit, they’d make it available to all the public for free.  So share your thoughts below and I’ll catch you again later.

# The world needs more people like this ump

I first noticed him as he stood at the rear of his car, trunk open, slipping his chest protector over his head. He’s tall, slender and an athletic appearing African American man. He had white hair and a white mustache. It made a striking appearance against his dark skin. I’m guessing he was at least 6-feet 5 inches tall and slender. Maybe 65 years old. Dignified. Deliberate. Purposeful. Our little family entourage headed toward the baseball field, not giving the apparent umpire another thought. Caleb prepared for his Little League game. At 8 years old, Caleb is focused. Determined. Ready. He loves baseball. As both teams warm up, the old umpire walked onto the field, looked at his watch and bellowed. “It’s time. We gonna play ball or warm-up all night?” The two young teams casually move into place. “We can play ball, or I can go home. It’s up to you.” The ump looks at both managers. It seemed to be the casualness that the ump finds irritating. I see the managers and coaches glancing at each other. They seem caught off guard by his directness. Before taking his place behind the plate, he calls the coaches over and gives them stern instructions. “Keep the kids in the dugout behind the fence. If you are not in a defensive position or up to bat, you’ll remain in the dugout. Get the dropped bats off the field, fast. I don’t want anyone tripping or getting hurt. And I wanna see some hustle. I ain’t gonna hang around here all night.” The managers agree and walk back to their teams. I was surprised by his abrupt nature. “These are kids,” I mumble. The first 8-year-old batter cautiously approaches the plate. Head down. Shirt untucked. “You don’t walk up to this plate with your shirt untucked. You hustle up to bat and you act like a ball player. Tuck in your shirt.” The young man looks at the ump, then back to his manager. “Don’t look at him,” the ump complains. “It’s not his job to dress you. Now tuck in that shirt and step up to the plate,” the ump says, this time with a changed voice. Soft. Encouraging. Mentoring. He is old school. A bit crotchety but in his heart, I sense that he believes he’s protecting a sacred tradition. There is no question who is in control. The ump runs a very tight ship. The young ball player swings and seems surprised he made contact. He drops his bat, looks at the ump who smiles and makes a ‘shooing’ motion with his hands. The batter runs to first base. The ump nods his approval towards first, as the next young boy walks up to the plate. The ump raises his hands and bellows. “I need some hustle here!” The managers on both sides begin pushing their kids to run, not walk to the plate. There is a change in both dugouts. A sense of importance. Purpose. The ump looks down at the next batter and shakes his head, then looks at the manager. “Hey coach, don’t send these ballplayers up here with their shoes untied. Somebody is gonna get hurt!” The boy seems frightened and just stares down at his untied shoes. Frozen. The ump, three feet taller than the boy, drops to a knee and ties the youngster’s shoe. I can’t hear the conversation, but I see a smile spread across the young boy’s face as the ump stands up and pats him on his head. That gesture … this giant of a man, stooping down and tying an 8-year-olds shoes … then standing and patting him on the head … told me everything I wanted to know about him. The managers quickly began inspecting their players. They seemed unsure what to think about the umpire, but his spirit is contagious. The ump expects discipline and hustle. I said aloud to no one, “He’s teaching them life-skills.” This all took place at a Little League game in Sierra Madre, Calif. My daughter and son-in-law live there with my two grandsons. We try to visit four times a year and always during spring and fall baseball. Both my grandsons, 6- and 8-years old play. At this game I had the pleasure of meeting and watching Mr. Isreal “Dino“ Charles in action as umpire and a loving mentor to a group of kids he has never met. After the game, I introduced myself and complimented him. I asked why he volunteers. “I love baseball and I want the kids to learn to respect each other and respect the game. What I try to teach them through baseball are life skills they need on and off the field. Be on time. Hustle. Be prepared. Look sharp. Try hard and be the best you can be.” I shook his hand and thanked him. I wanted to say more but the words didn’t come out, but now they are. As I walked away, the phrases “thundering kindness and tough love” kept sounding in my head. The world needs more people like Mr. Charles. He cares enough in his retirement to spend time on a hot, dusty baseball field to help the children of strangers learn valuable life skills. He has experience he wishes to share and does. I am grateful that my grandson met and spent time with this man. Mr. Charles wants the world to be a better place and volunteers his time to make it so. I will probably never see him again, but I will never forget my encounter with “the ump,” Mr. Isreal “Dino” Charles. He is making the world a better place, one baseball game at a time. Gary W.

# The tragic number of cats dumped on Birmingham's streets EVERY week

Thirty one cats are abandoned on West Midland streets every week, with kittens in particular being “dumped like rubbish”.  Exclusive figures from the RSPCA reveal that 1,596 abandoned cats were found across the county in 2018.  Campaigners have warned that owners are underestimating the long-term commitment of caring for a cat, which can be “hard work, time consuming and costly”.  They also said that abandoned cats were usually dumped in cardboard boxes or bags, or even left in a home when owners moved out.  The number of cats abandoned in the West Midlands is at its highest level for at least three years.  Figures go back as far as 2016, when 1,405 cats were dumped across the county.  That number rose to 1,537 the following year.  Carrie Stones, the RSPCA’s Cat Population Control Manager, said: “With an average of 86 cats coming into our care every day and a peak in the number of abandoned cats reported to us in summer this clearly highlights that the UK is facing a cat overpopulation crisis with so many cats ending up in rescue centres.  “We would always urge people to think about the long-term commitment that caring for a cat entails and avoid making a snap decision about whether to take on a cat or kitten, for example from family or friends or buying online.  “Sadly, we see so many litters of kittens dumped like rubbish in the summer months because often owners have made this quick decision and can no longer cope, or the kittens have been an unplanned litter and a shock to the owner of the moggy mum.  “There is no denying that kittens look cute but the reality of caring for them can be hard work, time consuming and costly.  “We, and other cat and vet organisations, believe the solution to this crisis is to neuter cats from four months old before they can become pregnant and therefore avoiding these unwanted litters.”  Across England there were 19,233 cats abandoned in 2018.  A total of 28,986 cats - including poorly strays, those that have been signed over because of neglect or part of a prosecution - were taken in to RSPCA centres up and down the country last year.  If you think you could help, we’ve created a new gadget to show all the animals that are available at your nearest branch.

# David De Gea: The HORRENDOUS stat that PROVES Man Utd goalkeeper has been awful

Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, United were all-but out of the tie after De Gea let Lionel Messi’s long-range strike squirm under his body and agonisingly over the line. Messi had earlier opened the scoring with a superb finish into the bottom corner from the edge of the box after cutting in from the right. But the night might be remembered most for De Gea’s costly mistake. More worryingly for United fans - it was not the first he has made this season. In fact, De Gea has now made three mistakes leading directly to goals in all competitions in 2018-19. Of Premier League goalkeepers, only Bournemouth’s Asmir Begovic (five) and Everton and England stopper Jordan Pickford (four) have more. De Gea’s howler left Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side needing to score three times without reply at the Nou Camp to progress to the semi-final. And while the stat makes for grim reading for the Spaniard, Messi continues to smash records in Europe’s top competition. He has now scored 24 goals in 32 Champions League games against English clubs - more than any other player. He is also just the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to score three Champions League goals against United in three different grounds. Meanwhile, Barca became the first side to rack up 100 home goals in the competition. Robbie Savage, who was watching the game for the BBC said United only had themselves to blame for both goals. “Both goals have come from Manchester United errors after they started so well,” he said. “Ashley Young loses the ball for the first and then Fred tries to Cruyff turn 25 yards for his own goal for the second. Poor play.” On De Gea, he added: “Oh no no no. David de Gea. It was such a weak effort from Lionel Messi and it just trickles under De Gea. Game over.”<end_of_turn>

# Former lawmaker assassinated in Anambra | TODAY.NG

A former lawmaker of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Mr Anthony Igboka, was on Tuesday night shot dead by unknown gunmen.  Igboka was reportedly assassinated at his Oye Nimo village market square in the Njikoka local government area of Anambra State while returning from a meeting.  It was gathered that the incident might not be unconnected to lingering chieftaincy tussle in the community following the demise of the last occupant of the seat some years back.  Confirming the incident, Police spokesperson, Haruna Mohammed, said the deceased was shot in his car near Nimo Market.  He said the state Commissioner of Police, Mustapha Dandaura had ordered a full-scale investigation on the matter.  He said, “At about 8:18pm of April 16, there were sporadic gunshots around Nimo Market in Njikoka Local Government Area.  “Police patrol team attached to Nimo Division rushed to the scene and discovered one Chief Frank Anthony Igboka on the driver’s seat of his Chevrolet SUV vehicle lying unconscious in the pool of his blood.  “His body was riddled with bullets. The victim was rushed to Beke Hospital, Nimo, where he was confirmed dead by a medical doctor and the corpse was later deposited at the hospital morgue.”  Mohammed added that preliminary investigation showed the victim was shot at a close range by four armed men who escaped in a pickup van towards Abacha-Eziowelle road.  He revealed that 25 expended 7.62 mm ammunition was recovered at the scene.  “The state Commissioner of Police, Mr Mustapha Dandaura, has visited the scene and ordered a full-scale investigation to ascertain circumstances surrounding the incident and bring perpetrators to justice,” Mohammed added.  The spokesperson appealed to the public to avail the command with information that could help in arresting the perpetrators of the dastardly act.  Meanwhile, the state Governor, Willie Obiano, has announced a N5m reward to any person who can provide useful information on the identity of the killers.  A statement by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C. Don Adinuba, said the governor has also directed the state Commissioner of Police to personally lead a team to apprehend the killers immediately.  The statement partly read, “He has, in addition, directed the Department of State Security, intelligence officers in the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Navy as well as the Nigerian Security and Defence Corps to join the Nigeria Police Force in the task to bring the culprits quickly.  “Chief Obiano asked the intelligence and security officers to reenact the same level of enthusiasm and competence they exhibited in the arrest two weeks ago of Ikechukwu Udensi, the most wanted murder suspect in Anambra State, immediately he entered the state to collect illegal revenues.  “You have to display the same commitment and competence this time in tracing the killers of Chief Igboka, who was also a former chairman of Njikoka Local Government Area.”  Describing the killing as utterly heartless, Obiano added, “It is a shame that the killing of Chief Igboka should take place in the week leading to Easter when men and women of goodwill throughout the world are reconciling themselves with God and fellow human beings.”  Obiano emphasized that no stone would be left unturned in the effort to ensure the state remained the safest and most peaceful state in Nigeria.  “Anyone who thinks that he can spill the blood of an innocent Anambra person and go scot-free is living in a fool’s paradise.  “All the persons who have in the last five years attempted to spill blood in the state have been caught up by the long arms of the law. Chief Igboka’s killers cannot be different,” he insisted.  The deceased, until his death, was the President-General of Nimo Town Union.<end_of_turn>

# Local nonprofit helps unite the community

In 2002, Roberta Warmack discovered a need in Calhoun-Gordon County – for someone to speak for and help the Hispanic community. Later that year, she founded a nonprofit that continues to bring both Spanish- and English-speakers together. The Latinos for Education and Justice Organization was started by Warmack as an agency under the United Way umbrella to help break the language and culture barrier between Latinos and Americans. Now, almost 17 years later, the organization itself has expanded far beyond Warmack’s vision. Offering programs to develop computer skills, leadership development and financial education, LEJO serves both students and adults, and is always accepting volunteers. Belen Reyes, the nonprofit’s current executive director, said her involvement started as a volunteer. “It was in 2006 when I contacted Ms. Warmack and she said come volunteer at LEJO,” Reyes said of her start with the organization. “It was good for me.” Reyes soon was hired as a part-time employee, and volunteered when she wasn’t working, essentially spending all of her time with the organization to help facilitate programs and lead Spanish conversation clubs. Moving up the ladder over time, Reyes moved to full-time and was later promoted to director nearly three years ago. She said being a part of LEJO has helped her not only by giving her something to focus on, but by also teaching her how to invest in the community. “It’s helped me a lot with my education and with the language barrier because I was struggling a lot with English, but now I feel more comfortable,” Reyes said. “I’ve learned to be more compassionate, to be more open to helping the community.” Reyes said the organization provides student tutoring Mondays through Thursdays, and she said they have a great location for students since they are just down the road from Calhoun High and Middle. They serve both county and city school students, yet because of their location, they mostly work with the city schools. While tutoring is provided for elementary and middle school students, Reyes said she sees a lot of past students return to LEJO to volunteer with the younger children and make a difference by giving back. They also have summer programs for students, providing an educational setting for students to learn while they’re on break from school. And while their programs are aimed to help acclimate Hispanics into society, Reyes said they are open to anyone who’s interested. “We don’t only serve Hispanics and Latinos, our doors are open to anyone,” Reyes said. “Our mission is to provide Hispanics, minorities and undeserved groups leadership, educational resources and mentorship needed to improve their quality of life.” LEJO is located at 681 Pine St., and offers programs such as after school tutoring, beginner computer classes, job search assistance, document translation, GED classes in Spanish, summer kids programs and English classes.

# A.S. Senator Exceeded $2,300 Spending Limit by Over $968 in A.S. Election, Falsified Receipts - UCSD Guardian

A.S. Transfer Senator and attempted A.S. presidential candidate Joseph “Joey” Giltner spent at least $968 more than the allowed amount for candidates and took steps to conceal his spending, according to information the UCSD Guardian has obtained from multiple sources. Giltner never appeared on the ballot after being deemed ineligible to run and later disqualified, though he appealed these decisions for the duration of the election period.  According to section 4.2 of the election code, slates and independent candidates are limited to using $2,300 of their own income on the election. The official number that Giltner listed for total expenditure was $1,123.96, with $137.35 coming from donated items, but documentation indicates that Giltner underreported his spending and that the actual figure surpasses $3,200.  Prior to his current term as a senator and his presidential candidacy, Giltner was involved in A.S. Council when he first attended UC San Diego from 2013 to 2016. He left the university to “pursue a career in corporate America,” but re-entered at the start of this academic year after attending California State University, East Bay and UC Berkeley.  Giltner announced his run for president of A.S. Council on March 16 as part of the slate Tritons United, which he assembled and headed. However, after Giltner filed his candidacy, it was determined that he was ineligible to vie for the position, which he told the Guardian was a result of not meeting the 2.5 minimum GPA requirement. Giltner appealed to have his transfer grades included in the calculation to become eligible, which the Judicial Board granted on April 10.  Despite the favorable ruling from J-Board, the Elections Committee had already disqualified the Tritons United slate and consequently Giltner from running on April 8 due to multiple violations of the election code committed by Giltner. The other Tritons United candidates disassociated from the slate on April 7 and were permitted to run as independents.  According to the election code, candidates are required to provide records of all campaign expenditure to the A.S. Elections Committee, and based on an investigation of the spending report for Tritons United that was written by Giltner, Giltner doctored some of the receipts he included to deliberately conceal the true amount he spent on at least three listed expenditures and failed to report at least five other purchases for which he was required to by the election code.  In addition to numerous supposedly donated items, Giltner alleged that he purchased 115 shirts for $431, $98 for a custom Tritons United Snapchat filter, 16 2’ x 4’ banners for $156.60, 2,500 stickers for $117.23, and 2,000 rave cards for $183.83. The Guardian received the receipts he entered with the Tritons United spending report to prove his purchases for the shirts, banners, and Snapchat filter.  According to Giltner’s receipt for the shirts, although he indicated that the quantity was 115 on the spending report spreadsheet, he paid Big Frog Custom T-Shirts $240.00 for 85 t-shirts and $60 for 15 tanks, without tax. However, an employee of Big Frog wrote in an email to A.S. President-Elect Eleanor Grudin, who verified the receipt with the company, that the receipt from Giltner was actually an “estimate/quote.”  “We never received payment for that invoice,” the employee, who also responded to a quote request from the Guardian, wrote to Grudin.  A partial photocopy of an invoice and a photocopy of a receipt printed from a cash register at the store that were given to the Guardian by former Tritons United member Danielle Viviani reveal that the true cost was a total of $1,912.56 for 100 t-shirts and 50 tanks, including tax.  At a unit price of $8.95 per 2’x4’ banner with next-day turnaround, the 16 banners were purchased by Giltner from Digital Room, Inc., according to the screenshot of a receipt that Giltner provided as evidence of his spending. This receipt was fraudulent as well — using the item number listed on the receipt, the Guardian received a copy of the original invoice for Giltner’s purchase from NextDayFlyers.com, a subsidiary of Digital Room, Inc., which states that the unit price was actually $28.95, including tax, and the total was $507.20, more than three times the cost Giltner reported.  Giltner attributed the higher cost on these receipts to the fact that some of the receipts may have “a bunch of items combined.” However, he did not elaborate on what these other items would be and why they differed from the receipts he submitted This also does not account for the fact that the number and type of banners he reported buying from Digital Room, Inc. are the same as the number and type of banners on the actual invoice.  The underreported cost of the Snapchat filter was the only incident of alleged false reporting actually heard by the A.S. Elections Committee. In a grievance brought by Grudin, Grudin provided photographic evidence of the custom Tritons United filter outside Starbucks, in front of Geisel Library, by Center Hall, and inside the Guardian’s office in the Original Student Center. Grudin additionally submitted a screenshot directly from Snapchat’s website showing the cost of a custom filter throughout much of the UCSD campus to be approximately $400 instead of the $98 Giltner listed.  This evidence was accepted by the Elections Committee, which found Tritons United to have violated the election code.  While the filter map done by Grudin extends to parts of the campus beyond what she provided photographic evidence for and what Giltner himself submitted as the covered area, the Guardian found that even using roughly the same area as Giltner, which only covers part of Price Center, Library Walk, and the entrance to Geisel Library, the cost would still surpass his reported amount and actually be around $187.  According to Giltner, this discrepancy is because he used personal connections to create the filter. He declined to provide evidence of this, stating that he wants to preserve these connections.  “I do work in a nightclub, and so I was able to use professional connections that gave us really good deals,” Giltner told the Guardian, referencing the low costs of his purchases in general. Giltner did not specify which items the deals were for or how they related to the inaccurate receipts.  Without the receipts submitted by Giltner for the rave cards and stickers, the Guardian was unable to verify the costs he reported for either item.  In addition to falsifying the Tritons United spending report and some of its accompanying receipts, Giltner also failed to report purchases for 15 picket signs, 15 additional banners, three photographers, one videographer, and Tritons United shirt pins, Viviani told the Guardian. The cost of the pins, banners, videographer, and two of the photographers is unknown to the former Tritons United members, but one of the photographers disclosed to Viviani that he received $450 from Giltner for his work.  As the work from the photographers and videographer was not received until April 1, Giltner explained to the Guardian, he did not have to report it for a full week in accordance with the election code, which is why it does not appear on the report. As of April 15, there is still no entry for these services listed in the Tritons United spending report, and as early as March 11, professional photos with credits to Amanda Lam were posted of the candidates on the Tritons United Facebook page.  Giltner’s claim that he had a week to inform the Elections Committee of purchases is also false — A.S. Elections Manager Kyler Vaughn informed the Guardian that due to Tritons United’s violations of the elections code, they actually only had 48 hours to report spending.  The picket signs were $22.47 each, according to a receipt from former Tritons United candidate Karsyn Stewart. Stewart paid for seven of the signs, which appear on her receipt, and Giltner covered the remaining eight, adding an additional $179.76 to his total expenditure.  Giltner told the Guardian that both the picket signs and pins were not actually used during the course of the campaign and therefore did not need to be reported. Viviani confirmed that the signs were likely not carried, nor were the buttons distributed, and Vaughn confirmed that purchases not used do not need to be entered into the spending report.  “I would have recorded the items if we had the chance to use it, but we never had the chance to use it,” Giltner said.  Using Giltner’s listed prices for the Snapchat filter, rave cards, and stickers and not including the picket signs, Giltner definitively spent at least $3,268.87, or more than $968.87 over the spending limit, not including the price of the remaining banners, two photographers, and videographer for which the costs are still unknown.  The former members of Tritons United collectively believe $3,268.87 is likely only a fraction of the amount Giltner actually spent throughout the election.  “We are in agreement that we believe Joey spent, conservatively, $4,000-$5,000,” Viviani said on behalf of the disaffiliated candidates.  Viviani expressed that it is unclear to her why Giltner went to such lengths during his campaign.  “I may never understand why $4000+ was spent to win an AS position, but at least that same individual who falsified receipts to hide said spending from the disaffiliated members of [Tritons United] and the rest of the student body will never be able to control the $6,000,000 AS budget composed of all of our student activity fees,” Viviani stated.  Due to being held in violation of the election code for also booking a spot for Tritons United on Library Walk through his position as an A.S. senator, Giltner is set to be impeached at the next A.S. Senate meeting, Grudin told the Guardian.<end_of_turn>

# Media addicted to Mueller, 'The Five' says

“It's like the media are like drug addicts who found out there's a new cheaper drug on the street and they're getting the cravings, they got the Mueller craving. They should just quit cold-turkey," Greg Gutfeld told his co-hosts after reacting to a montage of MSNBC and CNN clips. "The problem is they can't quit cold-turkey because they sold their audience a bill of goods,” On Thursday a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia and President Trump is expected to be released. I've got the Mueller munchies! Democrats are still demanding access to an unredacted report. This, as President Trump asserts that Attorney General William Barr’s four-page summary says he's been exonerated. Former Democratic National Committee chairwoman and co-host Donna Brazile said Americans wants to see the report. "This coming Friday I have nothing to do. I don't have to cook, I ate this remarkable chicken here in Nashville. I'm on a crash diet, so I have the munchies and I'm waiting for the Mueller report,” Brazile said referencing Gutfeld’s drug-addict reference. “I'm glad we get an opportunity to finally say once and for all the country was under attack," she said. "We know what happened in 2016. And perhaps we can learn from the mistakes of 2016 and don't let them get repeated in 2020.” “We know what happened in 2016. Trump won,” co-host Jesse Watters interjected. Special co-host and country music star John Rich also spoke about the report, saying most Americans don’t care about it. “This is just a media thing that none of us really care about, honestly,” Rich said.<end_of_turn>

# FirstEnergy Solutions Testifies in Support of Energy Policy Overhaul That Could Save Nuclear Plants

The Ohio House is holding hearings on a bill that would revamp the way renewable and nuclear energy is incentivized in the state. A committee heard from FirstEnergy Solutions, the owners of Ohio’s two nuclear plants, which said this bill brings parity to energy policy.   The energy bill would give out what’s being call “clean air” credits to energy generators who don’t produce carbon emissions. It would also do away with the green energy standards that require utilities to invest in alternative sources.  FirstEnergy Solutions VP Dave Griffing said this change will put nuclear on a level playing field with wind and solar energy.  “Who the state has chosen to incentivize not only the state but the federal government as well, where they’re getting tax credits or renewable credits for the same attribute that nuclear provides and doesn’t get compensated for," Griffing said.  The bill would cost residential ratepayers $2.50 a month. There’s a debate over whether getting rid of the green energy requirements will end up costing people more or less on their electric bills.<end_of_turn>

# The story behind acid attack: Obscene posts, police complaint and elaborate revenge plot

THE bustling locality of Sadashiv Peth, located in the heart of the city, saw a series of dramatic events on Tuesday night when a man attacked a 24-year-old youth with acid and shot at him, then shot at police personnel and later, when cornered by police, killed himself. Police have identified the attacker as Siddharam Vijay Kalshetti (23), who hailed from Akkalkot in Solapur district and was an oil trader. Police probe has revealed that the mother of the acid attack victim had filed a case against Kalshetti last year, accusing him of posting obscene messages about her on a social networking website. Based on her complaint, police had arrested Kalshetti in December and he had spent three days in police custody.  Police suspect that Kalshetti attacked the youth as he wanted to avenge his arrest. The first incident, the acid attack, took place at 8.45 pm when the victim was standing in front of a residential building in Sadashiv Peth and talking to a young woman. Kalshetti, who was carrying acid in a bottle, came up to them and threw acid on the youth, said police.  When the woman started screaming and raised an alarm, Kalshetti took out a country-made pistol and fired at the man, injuring him in the back. As the firing triggered chaos, Kalshetti fled the spot and sought refuge at a residential building nearby. The victim was rushed to a hospital, where he is being treated for serious burn injuries on his face and chest, and a gunshot wound on his back.  Alerted about the incident, police started looking for Kalshetti and located the building he was hiding in. As they closed in on the building, Kalshetti fired two rounds at the police team. But as the team inched closer to him, he shot himself in the head and died on the spot. His body fell inside the lift duct and was retrieved later with help from a Fire Brigade team.  Later in the night, two separate first information reports were registered at Vishrambag police station. Senior Inspector Sunil Kalgutkar, in-charge of the police station, said, “Prima facie, the attack by Kalshetti seems like an act to avenge the case registered by the victim’s mother at our police station. Kalshetti, who knew her via Facebook, had posted obscene messages about her. He was arrested and was in police custody for three days…”.  “The pistol used by Kalshetti is country-made but is a sophisticated one…,” added Inspector Kalgutkar.  The victim, who currently lives in Sadashiv Peth, is preparing for various competitive exams. The woman who was talking to him at the time of the incident was, prima facie, not connected to the sequence of events, said police. However, she is the complainant in the one of the FIRs filed in the case. Police are trying to find out if Kalshetti had any accomplices.<end_of_turn>

# Mom allegedly had sex with both her daughters’ teen boyfriends

A California mom may serve time after she had sex with both of her own daughters’ boyfriends — who were each high school freshmen when she stole them away from the girls, officials said.  Coral Lytle, of Tulare, pleaded guilty in March to 21 sex-related charges including unlawful sexual intercourse, oral copulation and contacting a minor for sex, news station KFSN reported.  But a disagreement over the 41-year-old mom’s sentencing Monday has caused a delay in the case and could now allow her to withdraw the plea, according to KFSN.  Lytle was accused of having sex on multiple occasions with the two Redwood High School students between September and October 2017.  Prosecutors said the mom provided alcohol and cigars to the underage boys, and would drive from her home to them for the raunchy rendezvous.  “The crimes in this case committed by the defendant involved great cruelty and callousness especially considering the defendant took advantage of a position of trust to molest two boys who she met when they (were in) teenage dating relationships with the defendant’s daughters,” prosecutors wrote in recent filings.  Authorities were initially notified when one of teen boys reported the “inappropriate relationship” with Lytle.  “[The victim] stated this was the last time he had sex with [Lytle] because he felt bad shaking [Lytle’s] husband’s hand knowing what he was doing with [Lytle],” prosecutors said.  Lytle appeared in court Monday, where the initial plea agreements collapsed as multiple judges disagreed over her sentence.  A judge indicated at a hearing in early March that she would likely be sentenced to three years in prison, but then a different judge who oversaw her enter the plea last month said he would offer her one year in county jail with a suspended six-year sentence.  Then a third judge said Monday he didn’t believe the sentence was appropriate and set another hearing for the following week.  The new hearing will enable the mom to withdraw her plea, prosecutors said.<end_of_turn>

# Utah prepares to drop, cover and hold on for earthquakes

The question of a significant earthquake striking Utah, especially along the Wasatch Front, is one of “when,” not “if.”  It’s the reason more than 920,000 Utahns will drop, cover, and hold on this Thursday as part of The Great Utah ShakeOut. Local schools, businesses, organizations and individuals can all participate by signing up at shakeout.org.  The idea behind The Great Utah ShakeOut is simple. On April 18 at 10:15 a.m., participants will drop to the floor, get under a table or solid surface, and hold on — the same actions recommended in the case of an earthquake.  April is National Earthquake Preparedness Month and it’s an opportunity to remind residents of the risk of earthquakes, according to Tooele County Emergency Management Director Bucky Whitehouse.  “We try to get folks to take the annual opportunity to look at their emergency preparedness plans (and) to learn more about earthquakes, because that’s the most catastrophic problem that we can have out here,” Whitehouse said.  The Oquirrh fault line lies along the Oquirrh Mountains in Tooele County and there will be some fracturing along the fault line in case of an earthquake, Whitehouse said. Most of the damage, however, will come from liquefaction of soil in low-lying areas closer to the Great Salt Lake with high water tables.  “Tooele County, as a whole, is not suspected to sustain the same kind or level of damage as our counterparts in the Salt Lake area,” Whitehouse said. “For that reason, it is thought to be a place where people will be sheltered from the Salt Lake Valley, in the Tooele Valley area.”  With Tooele County escaping the more significant damage expected along the Wasatch fault, it will likely be a staging area for agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  “Much of the federal response to an earthquake will come into Tooele County and be deployed into the Salt Lake area,” Whitehouse said. “It’s quite possible that our population numbers could double in 96 hours.”  An earthquake in Salt Lake Valley would also mean outside relief efforts would be focused on residents there. As a result, Tooele County residents are encouraged to prepare to take care of themselves in the aftermath of an earthquake, according to Whitehouse.  “The response is going to be massive in size and scope,” he said. “The more resilient we can be as individual households, the better it’s going to be for everyone.”  Residents should store enough food for at least 96 hours, as well as a gallon of water per day for each member of the household over the same span, including pets. Homeowners should also know how to shut off their utilities such as water, electricity and gas, and the structural state of their homes.  In addition to being prepared at home, residents should be aware of alternate transportation and evacuation routes, Whitehouse said. If a significant earthquake hits Salt Lake Valley, the Interstate 80 corridor into Tooele County will likely be impassable for at least 96 hours.  With so much of the community commuting, it’s also important for residents to have plans if someone is trapped on the other side of the Oquirrh Mountains for an extended period of time.  Whitehouse said residents can also sign up for the Tooele Ready app, which contains information about planning for emergencies, contact information for first responders and links to Tooele Alerts, the county-wide alert system, and Tooele Responds, the county’s volunteer coordination system.  Residents can sign up for Tooele Alerts and Tooele Responds through tcem.org.<end_of_turn>

# Susanna Reid - Kevin Clifton's a good mate... but he didn't end my relationship

Susanna Reid has denied that BBC series Strictly Come Dancing was the reason for her split from her ex Dominic Cotton, rubbishing claims of a show curse.  The star appeared on Loose Women on Thursday and defended her former Strictly dance partner Kevin Clifton, amid claims he's enjoying a secret romance with latest celebrity partner Stacey Dooley.  Stacey and her boyfriend recently broke up, with him said to have called Kevin out and claimed something was going on between them.  Now, amid differing reports over whether the duo are dating, Susanna defended Kevin and continued to deny claims that the show was “cursed” and led to break-ups.  She instead labelled it a “coincidence” before referencing her own split in 2014, following her appearance on the series.  Susanna commented: “Kevin and I got on like a house on fire, and Strictly was not responsible for the break-up of my relationship.  "I'm still fantastic friends with my ex and I’m still really good friends as well with Kevin."  Addressing the rumours about Kevin and Stacey, she again added she thought it was more likely to be a coincidence.  She said: “I would just say that is a coincidence, unfortunately. Especially in my case. I can't talk about anybody else's case.  "Unfortunately my relationship was at that stage, and I would say if you look at Strictly overall and who's participated, the vast majority of people in relationships when they start Strictly end up in the same relationships."  Kevin is yet to speak out over the claims, and appeared to avoid a question about Stacey in a new video.  On his way back from rehearsals Kevin, 36, was all smiles as he walked back to his hotel alongside fellow performers.  He was more than happy to say that everything with rehearsals was going "great" in the Mail Online video.  However he failed to offer a response when he was asked "will Stacey be making an appearance?" at his Burn the Floor show.  Loose Women airs weekdays at 12:30pm on ITV.<end_of_turn>

# Juwan Smith Voted 2019-2020 SGA President

Ethan Smith, News Editor  The Student Government Association held their presidential election last week and Juwan Smith was declared the winner.  Smith was voted SGA President over KeyShawn Housey and Zean Lopez.  Nearly 2000 votes were cast with Smith receiving 41.6%, Housey receiving 38.17% and Lopez receiving 20.58%.  A few weeks ago, at Armstrong campus’ presidential debate, Smith disclosed that diversity and graduation were two major point of focus within his campaign but not within the limits of what he wants to do.  “Recognizing various groups on campus and creating diversity is my biggest prospective project. I want to unite the students,” said candidate Smith.  Much of Smith’s campaign was based on the 90s show “Family Matters” that hits unity and inclusion across all forms of life, or in this case, three unique campuses.  “I have the passion to make the sacrifices needed to bridge all three campuses to make one family. I will create intentional meeting spaces for all campuses to come together and discuss concerns on all three campuses. It is my hope to show each student that Family does Matter,” said Smith to The George-Anne.  Executive Vice President (EVP) Spencer Demink, who resides on the Armstrong campus, will return in the same position for the upcoming term.  It will be his second term as SGA EVP, and Demink has had success through his first term here at Armstrong.  Smith will begin his tenure as SGA President in the Fall of 2019, succeeding current SGA President Jarvis Steele.<end_of_turn>

# United South wins first title in 16 seasons

United South wins first title in 16 seasons  The District 29-6A title race just got a whole lot clearer as United South claimed at least a share of its first title since 2003. The Panthers defeated United 3-0 while Alexander lost 5-3 against Del Rio Thursday to fall in the standings. In District 29-5A, Martin once again failed to clinch a playoff spot with few chances remaining.  Entering Thursday’s games, Alexander, Eagle Pass, United and United South were all within a game of one another. But now the Panthers stand alone on top of the standings.  United South (22-6-1, 9-2 District 29-6A) got going early in its 3-0 defeat of United. The Panthers scored two early first-inning runs thanks to back-to-back RBI singles by Greg Campos and Manuel Navarro. Scoring halted for a few innings until the Panthers add another run thanks to an RBI by Alex Cerda in the fourth. United South outhit United 8-3 in the victory. The Panthers got the win despite committing four errors.  Hector Alva got the win for United South on the mound. He lasted 5.1 innings allowing three hits while striking out four. Campos threw 1.2 innings in relief for the Panthers.  Leading the way at the plate for United South was Campos as he went 2-for-3 with an RBI. Cerda (1-2, RBI) and Navarro (1-3, RBI) both drove in runs for the Panthers as well. Devin Benavides (1-3), Jonathan Hernandez (1-3), Eric Ruiz (1-3, R) and Gerardo Villarreal (1-3) rounded out United South’s eight hits.  Oscar Cuello suffered the loss on the mound for the Longhorns (15-12-1, 7-4). He surrendered three runs on eight hits over six innings while striking out three.  Alexis Bautista led United at the plate as he went 2-for-3. Derrick Christman was the only other player to record a hit for the Longhorns as he finished 1-for-4.  With the loss, United now drops to fourth place in District 29-6A. As for United South it is one win away from clinching its first district title since 2003.  The Panthers will end the regular season against LBJ at 8 p.m. Tuesday at Uni-Trade Stadium and can secure the outright title with a win. The Longhorns’ regular-season finale will open the rivalry doubleheader at 5 p.m. Tuesday at Uni-Trade against Alexander.  Alexander’s chance for a sixth straight district title took another hit Thursday as it fell to Del Rio 5-3 at Krueger Field. With the loss, the Bulldogs (18-9-1, 8-3) are now in a tie for second place along with Eagle Pass (18-10-1, 8-3). No statistics for the loss were available at press time.  Alexander can still clinch at least a share of the league title Tuesday if it beats United and if United South falls to LBJ.  Nixon closed out its first 6A district season with a 2-1 win over LBJ. Both teams collected four hits and committed two errors in the game.  The Mustangs (15-12, 3-9) jumped out to an early 1-0 lead in the first inning after Antonio Buentello hit an RBI single on a 3-2 count to bring home TJ Rogerio. Scoring would subside until the fourth when Joey Gamez grounded out but brought home Caleb Muniz.  The Wolves (4-20-1, 0-11) did mount a comeback though as Ramon Lopez scored on a wild pitch in the top of sixth inning to cut the lead to 2-1. Yet it was a little too late for the Purple & Gold to take the lead.  Gamez led Nixon at the plate as he went 2-for-3 with an RBI. Buentello (1-4, RBI) and Muniz (1-2, R, BB) were the other two to record a hit for the Mustangs. Oliver Acuna (0-1, BB), Ari Gonzalez (0-0, 2 BB) and Sergio Reyes (0-2, BB) all reached via walks.  Rogerio got the win on the mound for Nixon. He lasted seven innings allowing four hits and one run while striking out six.  Jose Mares was the losing pitcher for LBJ. He went six innings allowing two runs on four hits while striking out five.  Lopez (1-3, R), Raul Carillo (1-3), Cesar Davila (1-1) and Mario Espinoza (1-3) all collected a hit for the Wolves. Angel Apac (0-1, BB) and Adrian Sanchez (0-2, BB) both reached on walks.  Nixon aims to end the year strong as its finale will be Tuesday at Uni-Trade against crosstown rival Martin at 7 p.m. LBJ has one more chance to avoid a winless district season as it will end its year versus United South at Uni-Trade.  In District 29-5A, Martin failed to clinch a playoff spot as it fell to Alice 3-2. With the loss, the Tigers (12-12-1, 5-6 District 29-5A) will need to win their final district game next week at home against Tuloso-Midway to control their destiny as they aim to capture their first postseason berth since 2016. Martin would also clinch if Alice lost either of its final two games against Tuloso-Midway and Flour Bluff.  The Tigers fell behind early as they were down 3-0 after the fourth inning. Yet they slowly clawed back into the contest as they scored a run in the fifth and sixth to cut Alice’s lead to 3-2. But Martin’s offense fizzled in the seventh as it went three up, three down to end the game.  The Tigers were outhit 7-4 in the loss. Bryan Aguilar (1-3, RBI), Jesus Escalante (1-4), Erick Guerrero (1-3, R) and Edgar Hernandez (1-3, RBI) all collected a hit in the contest.  Hernandez took the loss on the rubber for Martin. He lasted six innings allowing three runs on seven hits while striking out five.  The Tigers will take a break from district action Tuesday when they face Nixon at Uni-Trade. Martin will wrap up the season at home against Tuloso-Midway next Friday.  Cigarroa (10-14, 2-9) was idle Thursday. It will return to action Tuesday when it faces Calallen on the road.  St. Augustine clinched a playoff spot for the first time since 2011 when it defeated Brownsville St. Joseph 14-3 Wednesday. With the victory, the Knights improved to 11-4 overall and 4-3 in league competition. Poncho Valdez was the winning the pitcher. He was also one of St. Augustine’s top hitters along with Juan Elizondo.  gkroeger@lmtonline.com  Twitter: @gkroegs<end_of_turn>

# Collier Planning Commission delays vote on proposed mixed-use project

A proposed mixed-use housing development at Immokalee Road and Collier Boulevard drew criticism from some nearby residents Thursday as Collier County planning commissioners put off a vote on the project following hours of testimony. A developer is asking for a zoning change to allow for up to 400 multifamily homes or townhomes, 140 hotel/motel rooms and 370,000 square feet of commercial space on close to 56 acres south of Immokalee Road and east of Collier Boulevard. Planning commissioners unanimously voted to continue their discussion on the proposed development May 16. The proposed development, a joint venture between Barron Collier Companies and Metro Commercial, would be located on the former Pelican Nursery site with buildings that could reach up to 65 feet tall. The current plan proposes four-story buildings with residential-only structures near the southern and eastern boundaries where the property abuts the Tuscany Cove and Bent Creek Preserve communities. Along Collier Boulevard and Immokalee Road mixed-use buildings could have residences above retail or offices, according to a county staff report. The commercial land uses are oriented away from the nearest existing communities, said Wayne Arnold, a planner representing the developer. “We think it’s a very good, compatible concept,” he said. Part of the project would include installing a traffic signal on Collier Boulevard by the Pebblebrook Shopping Center to help with access to the center and alleviate congestion there, representatives for the developer told commissioners. “We will pay our fair share to have that traffic signal put in place,” said Rich Yovanovich, a land-use attorney representing the developer, adding that county staff agree the signal will improve traffic there. However, some commissioners said they were concerned about the traffic the project would add to the roads near the proposed development and pointed to already approved communities farther east that have not been built out yet. “My main concern really is traffic on this one,” said Commissioner Edwin Fryer. Norman Trebilcock, a planner and engineer whose firm prepared the traffic study for the developer, said a planned extension of Vanderbilt Beach Road to the east would potentially help relieve traffic “significantly.” It would “make all the difference in the world,” he said. County officials have previously said they hope to start construction on the extension in January 2021. Construction is expected to take two years, depending on weather. Some residents said they worried about having tall buildings close to their community. They asked to have lakes along the border with Tuscany Cove or a wall buffering the communities. Connie Walters, who lives in Tuscany Cove, said she can sit on her lanai and enjoy watching birds, squirrels and rabbits. Pelican Nursery was in her back yard. “I will now have a four- or five-story apartment building looking into my lanai,” she told commissioners. Walters said she would like to see more trees and buffers added if the development is approved, like a wall, a berm or a lake along the whole border. “The serenity, the beauty and the charm of Naples and our county is being chiseled away and we are in danger of becoming a disaster like the east coast,” she said. Brian Gorla, who lives in the Bent Creek Preserve community, east of the proposed project, said he sees it as a “good development” and would like to have access to it from his community, either through a walkway or a road with a gate. “If it’s restaurants and things like that that’s proposed, we see that as great, we got people saying they’re going to buy golf carts … and go use this facility,” he said. However, Gorla said, the top three concerns at the neighborhood information meeting he attended were “traffic, traffic and traffic.” He also said he would like to see a wall to separate the two neighborhoods.<end_of_turn>

# ‘Bold And The Beautiful’ Spoilers For Friday, April 19: Liam’s Worried

The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers for Friday, April 19 reveal that Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton) will be concerned about his marriage to Hope Logan Spencer (Annika Noelle). Ever since Beth supposedly died, they haven’t been able to connect on a physical level. And with Hope’s attention elsewhere, it seems as if Liam has every right to be worried.  Liam recently told Hope that even though he misses Kelly (Zoe Pennington and Chloe Maria Teperman) and Phoebe (Isabelle De Armas and Redford Prindiville), he still wants to concentrate on healing together. Their marriage took a knock when Beth died, and they have not been able to recover since.  At first, Hope was totally engulfed in her grief. Later, she formed a bond with Phoebe. In fact, Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) left in part because she thought that their connection was unhealthy. She asked Liam and Hope to focus on their marriage while she was away.  After Phoebe left to Paris with her mother, Douglas Forrester (Henry Joseph Samiri) came to town. The little boy had just lost his mother. Hope has been cheering him up and they spend a lot of time together, much to the delight of Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson).   — Bold & The Beautiful (@BandB_CBS) April 19, 2019 Liam is not the only one concerned about the state of his marriage. The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers indicate that Sally Spectra (Courtney Hope) and Wyatt Spencer (Darin Brooks) are also worried about the couple. They haven’t been able to bounce back and they see how Beth’s death has affected their marriage. Wyatt and Sally will talk about Liam and Hope. Of course, they can only provide assistance if the couple asks them to step in.  The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers tease that Liam will stop by Wyatt’s place. He needs someone to talk to and his brother has always provided sound advice. B&B viewers saw how Hope repeatedly rejected Liam’s physical advances. She later told him that she wasn’t ready for that part of their marriage yet.  He is worried that he and Hope will eventually split. After all, statistics prove that marriages don’t last when a child dies. In fact, Wyatt’s own marriage to Hope is a testament to this. After Hope lost Wyatt’s baby, she couldn’t cope. She then fled to Europe and they had their marriage annulled.  However, The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers promise that Hope and Liam will make love next week. Apparently, it’s the first time that they will be intimate since their daughter passed away.  The Bold and the Beautiful airs weekdays on CBS. Check back with The Inquisitr for the latest spoilers, recaps, and casting news.<end_of_turn>

# INPS official hospitalized for stress after comments outcry

NEWS DALLA SEZIONE  i più visti della sezione  NEWS DALLE PROVINCE  Crotone 19 Aprile 2019  Crotone, April 19 - The head of the Italian pensions and social security agency INPS said Friday that a female official who had prompted a furore by responding impolitely to comments on the agency's Facebook page had been hospitalized due to stress from the incident. "She is an official who just couldn't stand the pressure and not - as a newspaper reported this morning - a badly paid intern," INPS president Pasquale Tridico said. "Yesterday evening I called our official, who had spent the day in the hospital due to the stress she suffered from the incident. She has my complete sympathy and solidarity." "Our colleague had a difficult day and I felt it was the right thing to support her and to invite her to continue her work in serenity. "Of course one must respond appropriately and I am sure that this employee does so. INPS is open to social media because we want transparent and direct communication with citizens. Often, however, it happens that there is pressure on our officials and employees as occurred yesterday. "Of course there is the need for training and to develop our skills to an appropriate level, but the point is that the stress that we are subjected to leads to reactions lacking in composure."<end_of_turn>

# Workers rush to secure Notre Dame's weakened structure - live updates

Notre Dame fire: What we know A major fire erupted at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on Monday. The cause of the blaze remains unclear, but officials do not suspect terrorism or arson. About 40 people have been questioned by investigators. So far, about a billion dollars have been pledged to help restore the landmark. Construction workers hurriedly secured key sections of the fire-weakened Notre Dame Cathedral Thursday, including an area above one of its famed rose-shaped windows. Fire officials warned that the massive cathedral still remains very fragile and extremely dangerous for construction workers and other specialists.  Workers were using a crane to remove some statues to lessen the weight on the cathedral's fragile gables, or support walls, and to keep them from falling, since the section lacked the support of the massive timber roof that burned up in Monday evening's devastating blaze. They were also securing the support structure above one of Notre Dame's rose windows with wooden planks. The island in the Seine River housing Notre Dame at the heart of the French capital remained largely empty Thursday and closed to everyone but residents. Businesses were shuttered and the usual tourist throngs were nowhere to be seen.  The lack of tourists was a significant concern for neighborhood merchants. A large swath of the Ile de la Cite is currently inaccessible, with numerous bridges linking it with mainland Paris closed. Dozens investigating cause of massive Notre Dame fire  Authorities are still trying to piece together exactly what happened before Notre Dame caught fire, which officials believe was an accident. About 50 investigators are involved with the probe, and some 40 people, including those involved in the cathedral's restoration work before the fire, had been questioned by Thursday, according the Paris prosecutor's office. French newspaper Le Parisien reported that a fire alarm went off at Notre Dame shortly after 6 p.m. Monday but a computer bug showed the fire's location in the wrong place. The paper reported the flames may have started at the bottom of the cathedral's giant spire and may have been caused by an electrical problem in an elevator. Officials had said a fire alarm was triggered at 6:20 p.m., but no fire was discovered. Then, at 6:43 p.m., another alarm sounded. At that point, fire spread quickly from the roof near the rear of Notre Dame. In less than an hour, it engulfed the spire, which -- just 13 minutes later -- collapsed as onlookers watched in horror.  Photos show damage to Notre Dame  Notre Dame stands damaged but defiant after the fire that raged for at least 12 hours. Inside, where the spire collapsed, the altar was buried in debris, but its cross was almost shining, and pews were still in place, CBS News correspondent Roxana Saberi reports. Paris' City Hall released pictures of the inside of the 850-year-old church Wednesday, showing the soot-filled sanctuary covered in debris. The roof, with its 800-year-old wooden beams, is gone. Light shined through gaping holes in the intricately carved vaulted ceiling. Bertrand de Feydeau, vice president of the preservation group Fondation du Patrimoine, told the AP that the roof's wooden beams cannot be remade because "we don't, at the moment, have trees on our territory of the size that were cut in the 13th century." Even though the flames swept over the cathedral so intensely, much of the interior was saved, CBS News correspondent Ian Lee reports. Notre Dame's two medieval bell towers were still intact, and its stained-glass rose windows appeared mostly unscathed. Officials said it will be at least another day before scaffolding from the earlier restoration work is stabilized so the rubble can start to be cleared away.  "She was so beautiful, and now the sky is sad"  Bells tolled at cathedrals across the French capital Wednesday exactly 48 hours after the fire began. Cecile Deleville can hardly look at the destruction -- she has worshipped there for 44 years. "She was so beautiful, and now the sky is sad," she said. "This is such a shock to me."  Notre Dame was undergoing major renovations  The fire may potentially involve renovation work that was being carried out at the cathedral, Paris' fire service said. Extensive scaffolding covered a portion of the roof as part of the $6.8 million project before the fire broke out. Hundreds of millions raised for restoration  Deep-pocketed wine lovers in London raised nearly a million dollars Wednesday morning for the rebuilding of Notre Dame. Sotheby's auctioned off 25 five-bottle cases from one of the world's most prestigious wine producers, Château Mouton Rothschild. The sales were originally meant to raise money for the restoration of the Palace of Versailles, France's opulent former royal residence. About a billion dollars have been promised to help restore Notre Dame.  Bookstore owners urge "Hunchback of Notre-Dame" publishers to donate  Two bookstore owners are calling on publishers of Victor Hugo's iconic book "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" to join the funding campaign, according to BBC News. BBC News said Amandine Ardouin and Antoine Bonnet, whose bookshops are based in Paris, are asking other sellers and publishers to do their part.  A share of their income from sales of Hugo's novel, first published in 1831, will be pledged to the restoration project, they told French media. Notre Dame Cathedral's history  Construction of Notre Dame began in 1163 during the reign of King Louis VII and was completed in 1345. The cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a worldwide Parisian icon and the location of some of the most important moments in the history of France. Henry VI of England was crowned inside the cathedral in 1431 and Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned emperor of France inside the cathedral in 1804. The cathedral receives nearly 13 million visitors a year and is home to exquisite religious artifacts, paintings, sculptures and other priceless works of art. It had been undergoing renovations after cracks began to appear in the stone, sparking fears the structure could become unstable. CBS News' Roxana Saberi reported in March 2018 that years of rain, snow and pollution had eroded the flying buttresses that prop the cathedral up. James Shepherd, director of preservation and facilities at the Washington National Cathedral, spoke with CBSN on Monday about Notre Dame's epic history. "That's 800 years of history, of people pilgrimaging there and worshiping there, and the accumulation of culture," Shepherd said by phone. "All of that will have to be taken into consideration as they try to repair this church and save it after this devastating fire."  Shepherd spoke of Notre Dame's "stunning and exclusive stained-glass windows," which the cathedral's heritage director said Tuesday don't appear to have been destroyed in the fire. Shepherd called them "absolutely priceless and some of the best examples of European stained-glass windows."<end_of_turn>

# The 9:01: Challengers look to unseat Memphis Council's embattled Berlin Boyd

The 9:01 is your morning blend of Memphis news and commentary Good morning from Memphis, where the two Congressmen who represent Memphis have very different takeaways from the Mueller report. But first... Although the most expensive Memphis City Council race this year could be the one for outgoing member Kemp Conrad's seat, the most interesting one could be in District 7. Memphis City Council member Berlin Boyd, who has recently come under fire again for his potential conflicts of interest, could face four challengers in the Oct. 3 election, according to the latest, first-quarter campaign finance reports. Although they can't pick up petitions to officially join the race until May 20, the candidates filing reports are teacher Michalyn Easter-Thomas, insurance property claims adjuster and musician Jerred Price, teacher Catrina Smith, and management consultant Thurston Smith, who unsuccessfully ran for the same council seat in the previous election. During his tenure, Boyd has become a key swing vote on the council, often but not always siding with a council faction that is characterized by fiscal conservatism and the backing of powerful, well-heeled leaders in the local business community. Some of his stances have angered activists, particularly his sponsorship of a controversial resolution in 2016 to give control of most of the Overton Park greensward to the Memphis Zoo. But Boyd has the financial advantage heading into the campaign, raising $31,000 and $64 in the first quarter to give him an on-hand balance of $72,051. His list of contributors includes several heavy-hitters, including FedEx chief executive Fred Smith and his son, Greater Memphis Chamber president Richard Smith; Memphis Grizzlies president Jason Wexler; First Horizon chief executive Bryan Jordan; and many of the city's most prominent developers and architects. Of Boyd's challengers, Thurston Smith, who is well-known in Democratic Party circles, leads in fundraising with $19,800 in contributions. After spending $10,231, he ended the first quarter with an on-hand balance of $9,569. Behind him, Jerred Price — who is known locally for his popular Elton John impersonation concerts — raised $7,430 and spent $5,712, leaving him with a balance of $1,020. Catrina Smith raised $1,500 to end the quarter with $5,242 in the bank. Easter-Thomas raised no money. Boyd was recently under scrutiny for his role in bringing his employer, FedEx Logistics, to the old Gibson Guitar Building, which is partly owned by his partner in a Midtown multifamily development, Shelby County Schools board member Billy Orgel. After The CA's story on the potential conflicts, Boyd amended his state-required disclosure of interest statement to include his employment at FedEx Logistics. FedEx Logistics is relocating to the Gibson Guitar Building, Gov. Bill Lee and local officials announced Tuesday at the former guitar factory off Beale Street. Brad Vest, Memphis Commercial Appeal Boyd also caught flak in 2017, when he was heading up a task force on Beale Street security, after he said he "forgot" to recuse himself from a vote that could have benefited his then-client, the Beale Street Merchants Association. In the same meeting, he didn't recuse himself from another vote benefiting a cell phone tower development company belonging to Orgel. Another race to watch is in Super District 9 Position 1. Businessman Chase Carlisle, whose family company is developing the One Beale mixed-use project in Downtown Memphis, and University of Memphis' University District development officer Cody Fletcher are facing off for the seat of the term-limited Kemp Conrad. In the first quarter, the well-connected Carlisle raised $120,000 — the most of any council candidate in the quarter. The also well-connected Fletcher raised $51,615, setting up what will likely be the most expensive council race of the year. SCS investigates superintendent Ray Shelby County Schools interim superintendent Joris Ray was investigated after the district received two unverified, semi-anonymous complaints about alleged sexual harassment, our Jess Rollins and Sarah Macaraeg report. From the story: "Through our investigation, we have been unable to substantiate the sexual harassment claims made in M. Jones letter against Dr. Ray," Andre B. Mathis, a member of Glankler Brown, wrote in an investigative summary. The revelation of the investigation, which had not previously been disclosed, comes as the board prepares to vote April 30 whether to abandon a search for a new superintendent and hire Ray outright. The question now is whether the allegations — which are, again, unsubstantiated — will sway any school board members toward continuing a national search for a superintendent. Ray has expressed interest in the permanent position. Speaking of schools:Gov. Bill Lee could limit his school vouchers proposal to Shelby and Davidson counties, our Joel Ebert reports from Nashville. Memphis lawmakers react to Mueller report U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen talks with media about the Mueller Report while in his office Thursday afternoon. Brad Vest, Memphis Commercial Appeal U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, the Memphis Democrat at the forefront of a push to impeach President Donald Trump, is calling on the House of Representatives to censure Trump for interfering with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian collusion. If you haven't read the 448-page report (here it is in full), Mueller decided not to bring charges against the president for collusion but also didn't exonerate him. The report also delivers a searing indictment (in the non-legal sense) against Trump's many attempts to derail the investigation, leaving open the question of whether he's guilty of obstructing justice. Here's Cohen's take, as reported by our Katherine Burgess: “This illegal, unethical and immoral conduct by Donald Trump and misleading information by Attorney General (William) Barr needs to be sanctioned by our legislative bodies, and the way we can do that is through a censure resolution," Cohen said. “There’s too much there not to see there’s a connection between Trump and Russia that is not healthy for the United States of America." U.S. Rep. David Kustoff, R-Germantown, had a different take, releasing a statement saying Barr "made it very clear that there was no collusion and no obstruction of justice." “As a former United States Attorney, I believe Attorney General Barr handled the legal requirements with the public’s need for full transparency extremely well,” Kustoff said. “I hope the (Democratic) party can finally move on and end their politically motivated investigations against President Trump. I look forward to thoroughly reading the full report in the coming days.” Speaking of the Mueller report:The report also looked at the activities of a fake Tennessee GOP Twitter account linked to Russians.

# Navy Lt. says forget Notre Dame, donate to Puerto Rico

STAFFORD, Va. — After the world watched Notre Dame go up in flames, $1 billion was raised within two days to repair it. Inspired by this effort, a local Navy lieutenant who grew up in Puerto Rico started a GoFundMe page in the hopes of replicating the cathedral's success for poorer communities across the globe. “I was surprisingly kind of emotionally impacted by that, because…I love architecture…so I fell in love with the building, with the cathedral, so when I saw that, I had a visceral reaction to it," said LT. Siul Rivera, who currently serves in the Navy Reserves.  That moment brought Rivera across the ocean back to 2017 when Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico. “I felt a little bit uncertain about the status of my family there and my friends, because you could not get in contact with anybody," he said. While some expressed anger on social media that people were funneling their money to the cathedral, the generosity inspired LT. Rivera. “If you can do it in two days, you can certainly do it for other buildings and other infrastructure…so that’s why I created a GoFundMe…I’m hoping that people can see the need in infrastructure repair in poor communities as a flame as well," said Siul. He wants to raise $1 million to repair infrastructure in the poorer communities he's visited across the globe, ranging from his homeland in Puerto Rico to Thailand.  “So my appeal is to everybody’s hearts…and even though that might not be a flame on fire, I hope that people can take a moment and look at that picture and see themselves living in there and think should that be the case?” said LT. Rivera. He hopes that others agree that it should not be the case. LT. Rivera has a three step plan to dole out the $1 million: Work with local organizations like Habitat for Humanity Work with local group of pro bono architects and engineers Work with local government to get permission to access location<end_of_turn>

# Spring drills underway, Vikings still trying to lose ‘bitter taste’ of 2018

When the Vikings arrived this week for offseason workouts, they still had last season’s finale on their minds  To make the playoffs, the Vikings needed a win or a tie Dec. 30 at U.S. Bank Stadium against Chicago, which had clinched the NFC North and didn’t have much on the line. But Minnesota lost, 24-10, and finished a season that had begun with Super Bowl aspirations 8-7-1.  “We left a lot on the table,” running back Dalvin Cook said. “The main goal is to go win the Super Bowl, and we left that on the table. We didn’t achieve our goal, so we have a bitter taste in our mouth.”  Not making the playoffs gave players three extra weeks before the start of spring drills than they had in 2018, when Minnesota advanced to the NFC Championship Game. So, they’ve had plenty of time to contemplate what went wrong.  “For me, it feels super long, especially if you don’t make the playoffs,” safety Harrison Smith said this week. “It gets boring. You’re trying to find things for you to stay busy. So, it’s great to be back in the building and have some semblance of preparing for something and working towards a goal together.”  The Vikings failed to make the playoffs despite ranking fourth in the NFL in total defense, their third straight season in the top four. But they were without middle linebacker Eric Kendricks for the final two games of the season because of a hamstring injury.  “I thought if we made a little run, I’d be able to come back and contribute,” Kendricks said.  Instead, Kendricks and teammates cleaned out their lockers the day after losing to the Bears.  “It’s definitely hard when you see everybody in the playoffs, chasing the Super Bowl,” Kendricks said. “That definitely sucks. But it also gives you a chance to reflect on yourself, your own performance a little bit. What you could have done a little bit better, what the team could have done better.” The defense hasn’t changed much. The most major difference is the absence of defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson, who left for Cleveland as a free agent and will be replaced by Shamar Stephen, who returns after being with Minnesota from 2014-17.  On offense, departures included backup running back Latavius Murray, who signed with New Orleans, and starting guards Mike Remmers and Tom Compton moving on. Remmers was released and Josh Kline was signed as his likely replacement on the right side. Compton joined the New York Jets after not getting an offer to return, and the Vikings eventually signed Jets free agent Dakota Dozier as a candidate to replace him at left guard.  There also were changes on offense with the coaching staff. Gary Kubiak, who coached Denver to a win in Super Bowl 50, was named assistant head coach/offensive adviser and Rick Dennison offensive line coach/run game coordinator. Kevin Stefanski was retained as offensive coordinator after serving in that role for the final three games of 2018.  “Just getting back to work, building a foundation,” quarterback Kirk Cousins said. “We’re learning football all over again, if you will.”  The Vikings are moving forward, but can’t help but look back.  “It’s always hard when you don’t meet expectations,” tight end Kyle Rudolph said. “Everyone knows how our expectations were this time last year, coming off playing in the NFC Championship Game. … We have to earn our way back.”<end_of_turn>

BRIDGEWATER — Bridgewater Public Library Director Sean Daley has quietly left the job amidst a lawsuit against the library for banning an East Bridgewater man with autism. Daley had served as director of the library since May 2010. Library staff confirmed Friday that Ann Gerald is the current acting director and referred questions to Town Manager Michael Dutton. Dutton declined to comment Friday whether Daley is still employed by the town, the circumstances surrounding his departure and exactly when he left, simply stating that he does not comment on personnel matters. He also did not comment on whether Daley’s departure was related to the ongoing lawsuit. However, Daley’s town email is no longer active, yielding an automatic reply: “Thank you for contacting the Town of Bridgewater. This account is no longer active.” Gerald is also listed as the “Library Director” on the SAILS Inc. website, a non-profit that provides online catalog and circulation systems for 72 libraries and branches in the Southeastern part of the state, including Bridgewater. The lawsuit, in which Daley is named a defendant, was first filed in U.S. First District Court in Boston in April 2018. The complaint alleges that library officials violated the Americans with Disabilities Act after banning East Bridgewater resident Brandon Fisher, who has been diagnosed with autism, in August 2016. Along with Daley, the Bridgewater Public Library, the library’s Board of Trustees and the town of Bridgewater are also named as defendants. The case stems from an incident in August 2016, when Daley called Bridgewater police to issue a “no-trespass” order against Fisher, as confirmed by court documents, alleging inappropriate behavior with patrons and staff. Fisher’s father, Clem Fisher, met with Daley in November 2016 to discuss the no-trespass order. In a transcript of that conversation, included in court documents, Daley said that Brandon was “following the girls around the library” as well as commenting on their clothes repeatedly and staring for “inappropriate amounts of time.” Clem Fisher fought back, repeatedly requesting that the ban be lifted, saying that the library misinterpreted his son’s actions because his son has autism. Because of Fisher’s autism diagnosis, the lawsuit complaint states, he has difficulty with social awareness as well as social and communication skills. Individuals with autism often “stare” while processing information and Fisher’s attempts to socialize with staff and patrons were misconstrued, the complaint states. Fisher has never been reported as violent or aggressive, the complaint states. The defendants’ denied that in court documents. At a Jan. 17, 2017 library Board of Trustees meeting, Clem Fisher once again requested that the no-trespass order banning his son from the library be lifted. He was informed that his request was denied, according to the minutes from the meeting. He subsequently went to the home of then-library trustee Amy Braga to discuss the situation. The next day, Daley emailed Clem Fisher, informing him that his actions regarding the situation with the library were “reckless and alarming.” Daley ended the email warning him that he, too, was no longer welcome at the library. As part of the complaint, plaintiffs are suing Daley for defamation for comments he made in a September 2017 Boston Globe article about the situation. Daley was quoted in the article as saying Brandon had been “harassing and stalking underage women” and “was seen lurking around the children’s program multiple times.” According to the article, Fisher said he did not believe that, saying his son is a “very docile, friendly person ... he’s not a threat.” The lawsuit remains ongoing, with the next court date scheduled for May 10. Gerald did not respond to an email inquiry about assuming the role of acting library director by Enterprise deadline.<end_of_turn>

# Nazareth victorious in 'unbelievable' experience at Wrigley Field

It was the little things that made for a big-league experience for the Nazareth baseball team April 17 in its win against rival Marist at the Friendly Confines. Yes, that’s Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs. Nazareth continued its impressive run by beating Marist 12-2, which was important, but then there was everything else. “Just having a Gatorade (cooler) with water in the dugout was so big-league to me,” senior catcher Andrew McKenna said. “And then being able to take full (batting practice) on field with the turtle, which is the batting cage, I thought was really cool. The padded seats in the dugout … it was the little things that the big-leaguers have that makes you want it even more.” Senior shortstop Zach Carmignani, who went 1-for-2 that day, has been a Cubs fan since birth.  “We got there about two hours early, so we got to see the whole field, and then we got to take BP under the home dugout, which was insane,” he said. “We hit first, but then afterwards, we ran onto the field. “It was just unbelievable, just seeing everyone who came to support us. This is where I usually watch people play, and now I’m playing here.” Playing at Wrigley Field had been in the works since December. Local Cubs scout John Pedrotty helped organize the event to showcase the talents of a couple players who could be selected in the upcoming MLB draft. Those players include Nazareth senior pitcher Michael Prosecky and Marist senior outfielder Jason Hodges, who are committed to Louisville and Arkansas, respectively. Prosecky was solid in his appearance at Wrigley Field. He earned the win after throwing five innings and striking out five, while allowing just one earned run. He got plenty of help from his offense, as the Roadrunners (12-2, 2-2 East Suburban Catholic Conference) put up five runs in the fourth and sixth innings.  Junior Teddy Olander did the most damage with a two-run triple in the sixth that rolled all the way to the wall. McKenna had a pair of hits, while senior outfielder Troy Siranovic had two hits and two RBIs. There was a lot of pressure on Prosecky, considering the venue, the opponent and the fact that there were an estimated 40 MLB scouts in attendance, along with about 500 spectators from Nazareth alone. “I was just trying to go out there and compete and hope to give us a chance to get a win, because that would have been just awesome to say we won at that field on that kind of stage,” Prosecky said. “With all the scouting stuff, that’s not really stuff that’s in my control, so I just tried to compete with my guys and have fun with it and embrace the moment.” But an important question remained: Is Prosecky a Cubs fan?  “My mom is a die-hard. She has the (memorabilia) and stuff in our basement, but my dad and I, we tend to side with the White Sox,” he said with a laugh. The players weren’t the only ones who enjoyed the day. So did Lee Milano, who is in his 20th season as the Roadrunners’ head coach. Milano said that in his 24 years of coaching, the Wrigley Field experience was probably in his top five moments. Still, it was an important conference game. “We tried to compartmentalize everything for the week,” Milano said. “There was a task at hand, and we had to compete. There was nothing different about the dimensions, the diamond we were playing on. We had to play our brand of baseball.” Gregg Voss is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.

# Endurance advocacy group welcomes reform proposals for discipline - Horsetalk.co.nz

Clean Endurance, a group which has pushed for reform to rein in cheating, doping and horse abuse within the discipline, says it welcomes the findings of the Endurance Temporary Committee (ETC).  The ETC was appointed by the FEI in October last year in a bid to find solutions to ongoing welfare issues and reputational damage to the discipline, much of it arising from the fast-style desert racing centred on the Gulf region.  It presented its extensive findings this week, on the second day of the FEI Sports Forum in Lausanne, Switzerland.  Clean Endurance said in a statement that it was heartened by the FEI’s expression of its intent to move Endurance to a better place.  The group said cheating, welfare issues and drug use were still rife in Endurance.  “Clean Endurance applauds the emphasis on horsemanship and horse welfare the various members of the ETC made the centre of their respective presentations.  “Ensuring these values come back to form the foundation of Endurance is the only way the sport can survive and thrive in the future.  “Nearly all of the proposals brought forward by the ETC have in the past been suggested to the FEI by Clean Endurance, albeit often in more stringent versions.  “These include qualifying as a combination, imposing minimum weight limits to reduce speeds, limiting the number of starters, imposing longer minimum loop lengths and more phases in the competition, limiting the number of crew members, shortening presentation times and lowering maximum heart rates, not allowing second presentations at vet gates, the introduction of tack and blood rules, extending the time limit for reporting rule violations, and increasing sanctions for horse abuse.”  It said it encouraged and supported the FEI in taking forward the proposals as they stand today, with one caveat: It believes the completion-rate based qualification is potentially cumbersome for organising committees and officials, making it vulnerable to fraud.  “Regrettably, there are already many recorded examples of falsified qualifying results in our sport,” the group noted.  It recommended that the FEI examine the French ranking system for lower-level national rides, which incorporates speed and heart-rate recovery.  “This system has worked on set speed rides in France for over 20 years, can be easily adopted for free speed rides, and rewards strategic riding and horsemanship without the need for capping speeds.  “Clean Endurance has also asked the FEI to be mindful of the unintended potential negative consequences of extending the Mandatory Rest Periods (or “Mandatory Out Of Competition Periods” as the current proposal names them) as they can potentially penalise amateur riders who compete only one or two horses, as well as the organising committees which put on technical, ‘old school’ rides to cater for this group.”  The group would also like to see the re-introduction of the two-hour mandatory waiting period for invasive treatment after a horse has placed at an event.  “Far too often today, horses are in the clinic hooked up on drips while their ‘victorious’ riders are on the podium receiving their awards. Not allowing immediate invasive treatment will encourage riders to slow down and thus protect the horses.”  The details of the many rule change proposals still needed to be worked out by the ETC before the consultation process with national federations starts in early July.  “Clean Endurance urges anyone with an interest in the sport to provide their comments and suggestions to contact.cleanendurance@gmail.com, to the FEI at endurance@fei.org, and to their respective national federations, who will ultimately vote on these proposals at the FEI General Assembly in November 2019.”  Clean Endurance is a global collective committed to restoring the traditional values of the discipline. It has an informal working relationship with the FEI. Indeed, several recent FEI rule changes, procedures as well as sanctions, have been developed from matters the group has raised.<end_of_turn>

# Business owners seek taskforce to tackle unpaid bills

Outgoing Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) national chairman Kiprono Kittony has called for the formation of a taskforce on unpaid bills. Mr Kittony said the team should be mandated to collect data on unpaid bills in national and county governments as well as by the private sector. “This is a huge problem that has remained unaddressed for years and continues to hurt many companies and individuals making Kenya a costly place to do business. Let us analyse the amount of debt owed as well as age of the debt,” he said. Mr Kittony said the probe should be extended to State corporations and multinationals. “We must seek a lasting solution to this problem that has disrupted the trust needed to do business in Kenya. Billions of shillings are held by unscrupulous businesses while the government agencies owe payments for years with no recourse offered to traders,” he said. Last February, the National Assembly’s Committee on Implementation (CoI) received a report from the Treasury indicating Sh32.5 billion was yet to be paid by government to local traders as at November 12, 2018. Among the biggest defaulters are the Ministry of Defence that owes Sh8.93 billion, Ministry of Health Sh7.1 billion, State Department of Interior Sh5.4 billion and State Department for Broadcasting and Telecommunications at Sh3.2 billion. Last January, Treasury Secretary Henry Rotich said counties risked losing up to half the share of funds from the national government over Sh108.41 billion owed to contractors and suppliers at the end of the last financial year in June 2018. Mr Rotich said the national government may be forced to intervene in cases where counties had defaulted on payments amounting to more than Sh1 billion for more than 90 days. On the private sector front, Kenya Association of Retail Suppliers has said retail chains owe them about Sh40 billion, with many counting losses after market giant Nakumatt went under receivership, closing most of its flagship and once profitable stores.<end_of_turn>

# Winnie Harlow says she's not 'suffering' from vitiligo

“I am conquering, I am living, I am living my best life in the way that I can and thriving.”  Winnie Harlow is here to set the record straight: she isn’t “suffering” from vitiligo.  During an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, Winnie got real about what it’s like to be a public figure with the condition, which results in the loss of pigmentation from certain areas of her skin.  The Canadian model expressed her frustration over seeing articles that frame her experience with vitiligo as weakening, adding that she doesn’t think it is another person’s place to tell her whether or not she is “suffering.”  “I don’t feel like I am suffering,” Winnie said. “I am conquering, I am living, I am living my best life in the way that I can and thriving.”  This isn’t the first time that Winnie has spoken out about this topic. Last year she took to Instagram to highlight the issue after being referred to as a “vitiligo sufferer” in a British newspaper.  “I AM NOT SUFFERING!” Winnie wrote. “If anything I’m SUCCEEDING at showing people that their differences don’t make them WHO they are!”  We couldn’t love that message more. Winnie is proof that a person’s differences do not limit their potential.  From walking in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, to appearing on countless magazine covers, to landing a spot as an SI Swimsuit 2019 rookie, it’s safe to say Winnie is definitely thriving.

# The shocking, weird, and wonderful: 6 moments from the Saftas to remember

The shocking, weird, and wonderful: 6 moments from the Saftas to remember  Between the top billing walks, weird sounds that kept interrupting the broadcast and awkward speeches from people who have no business being in front of the camera (I’m looking at you the people announcing Prince Kaybee’s mixtape at the end. Why?), there were other moments that really made the Saftas worth watching.  There was the political, the weird and the simply beautiful. Here are some of those memorable moments.  Let’s bow our heads for moments of noise  Audience members and viewers at home were called to moments of silence on Saturday to honour those who had died. First, it was by Vincent Moloi, who wanted to honour his mother when he won the Golden Horn Award for Best Achievement in Directing in a TV Drama for Tjovitjo. Then it was host Thomas Masinga, who led the moment of silence for the tragic death of Sibusiso Khwinana.  However, both moments were marred by noise. Warren Masemola spoke into the microphone to support Moloi who was bowing his head for the moment of silence, which led to the audience laughing at the irony. Then during Khwinana’s moment of silence, Pearl Modiadie could be heard backstage talking and possibly trying to fix audio issues. It was a mess.  Literally La La Land…all puns intended  It was a mess when Jill Levenberg was announced as the winner for the Best Supporting Actress in a Feature Film when in fact it was Ilse Klink who won the award. Levenberg was in fact also a winner but for the Best Actress award for her role in Ellen: The Ellen Pakkies Story.  But 2018 Best Actress winner Crystal-Donna Roberts was amazing at handling the slumbering debacle that also involved an awkward moment of waiting for an announcement card. But in the words of Klink, “Hulle sê drama by die drama,” which can be loosely translated to mean there is "drama at the drama".   The @nfvfsa's #SAFTAs13 marred by winner envelope mistakes as actress Crystal Donna Roberts and @McDonalds_SA boss Greg Solomon were awkwardly left struggling on stage with first no envelope, and in the next category the wrong envelope:https://t.co/yee4a7AlVs pic.twitter.com/ZGBTy60YI8 — TVwithThinus (@TVwithThinus) March 4, 2019 The EFF will bring free education in May apparently  When Vuyani Pambo went on stage to accept the award for Best Documentary Feature, he saw it as an opportunity to support FeesMustFall activists Khaya Cekeshe, Mlungisi Madonsela and Katlego Monareng, who were still in jail for their activism for a “free decolonised quality education”.  But he didn’t stop there. With arts & culture minister Nathi Mthethwa right there in the audience, Pambo called him out for having been police minister during the killing of the 32 Lomnin mineworkers during the Marikana massacre and stating that their children will get to experience a free education. He then left the audience shocked when he declared that the EFF will win the elections on May 8 and bring about free education for all.  “We beat Bonang Mom”  SivNgesi’s mom apparently did not have much hope that her son could beat Queen B for the Favourite Presenter award. In fact, judging from the bro-hugging he did with his fellow presenter “boys” from the Man Cave, Ngesi was just as shocked to have won, prompting him to scream “We beat Bonang Mom”.  Lorcia Khumalo is a proud coloured woman and demands more stories that show this  She was nominated and won as Lorcia Cooper in the Best Supporting Actress category for her role as Tyson on the drama series, Lockdown, but she publicly declared that she is now Lorcia Khumalo.  The actress, dancer, dance teacher and choreographer was supported by her children on stage as she emotionally read out a speech she had written on her phone. She did not mince her words during her acceptance speech for her first nomination and win, calling out the industry for not creating enough diverse roles for coloured people which don’t fall into stereotypes. “Awe ma se kind. Awe ma se kind,” she proudly declared as she dedicated the award to coloured people.  Moshidi calls to her ancestors as she comforts her mother  When Moshidi Motshegwa won her Safta award for Best Actress in a Telenovela, you cannot be blamed for thinking about the drama around her axing from the show she won the award for.  Yet, instead of bringing attention to that negativity, Motshegwa brilliantly recited her clan praises, then went on to comfort her mother, grieving the loss of the love of her life, in the most tear-inducing but beautiful description of a mother-daughter bond.  But it was when she proclaimed “...to every black mother in the township who ever raised that kid on hope and prayer, I am a product of hope and prayer...” that she truly hit a home run and pulled at many a fan’s heartstrings.

# Survey: Majority of Hoosiers believe in climate change, support efforts to address it

Survey: Majority of Hoosiers believe in climate change, support efforts to address it  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – A statewide survey released Monday found that a majority of Hoosiers believe in climate change.  The survey, commissioned as part of the Indiana University Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative, revealed that four out of five Indiana residents believe in climate change and three out of four support efforts to address its impact.  Additionally, three out of four respondents believe that climate change will have a negative impact on Indiana’s economy.  A majority of those surveyed report more frequent observations of flooding, agricultural damage, unpredictable weather patterns and infrastructure deterioration in the form of potholes.  While the survey indicated some differences by political affiliation (41 percent of Republicans think there is scientific uncertainty about climate change versus 17 percent of Democrats), both Republicans and Democrats offer majority support for measures to improve the state’s resilience in the face of climate change.  Researchers say the results provide further evidence that community-based strategies are needed if Indiana is to effectively respond to, mitigate and adapt to the threats posed by climate change.  “These survey results suggest that Hoosiers know we must act now to protect the environment we have, while we have it,” said Janet McCabe, assistant director of policy and implementation for IU’s Environmental Resilience Institute and a former assistant administrator at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “As we continue to experience the consequences of a changing climate — historic flooding, record-setting cold — the challenge is hitting close to home. That’s especially true for a pillar of our state’s economy: our farmers and all of us who depend on them for our food.”  More than 1,000 Indiana residents participated in the survey from April 3 to April 10. IU says the margin of error fell within plus or minus 3 percentage points, with a confidence interval of 95 percent.<end_of_turn>

# On Campus: Lipinski helps Edinboro win 4 straight

Villa Maria grad Osiecki claims honor for Carlow softball  Fairview graduate Roni Lipinski had a memorable two days Wednesday and Thursday when she helped the Edinboro softball team claim four consecutive wins. In fact, she hit home runs to end back-to-back games over consecutive days. On Wednesday, Lipinski started the Fighting Scots' two-day run by hitting a two-run single in the first inning to open the scoring in the first game of a doubleheader against Mercyhurst. The Scots led the rest of the way in a 7-4 win. The senior catcher then turned in the biggest game of her career during Game 2. She hit a grand slam in the first inning, and her solo home run in the fifth inning ended an 8-0 Edinboro victory by mercy rule. Against Slippery Rock the next day, Lipinski capped Edinboro's comeback from a 9-3 deficit by hitting a solo home run in the bottom of the eighth to give the Scots a walk-off 10-9 win. She singled and scored earlier in the game. Lipinski capped the four-game stretch by hitting a single and scoring in Edinboro’s five-run sixth inning as the Scots beat SRU 5-0 in Game 2. In the four games, Lipinski went a combined 7-for-15 with three homers, five runs scored and eight RBIs. She entered the week with no home runs and four RBIs on the season. • Villa Maria graduate Annamarie Osiecki of Carlow University was named the United States College Athletic Association softball pitcher of the week after she went 2-0 from the pitcher's circle. Osiecki, a sophomore pitcher/first baseman, pitched a complete game and struck out 10 while earning the victory in a 7-1 win over PSU-Beaver on April 9. She allowed four hits and walked one. On April 13, Osiecki allowed just one run while pitching another complete game in a 4-1 victory over WVU Tech. She did not have a strikeout, but she scattered seven hits and had just one base on balls. Osiecki entered the weekend with a 5-5 record and a 4.29 ERA, but during a recent four-game stretch she went 3-0 while giving up just one earned run in each game. She was hitting .274 with 12 RBIs. • Two Gannon softball players earned PSAC weekly awards as Madi Beining was named PSAC Western Division pitcher of the week and Rachel Tanilli was awarded athlete of the week honors. Beining picked up two wins by posting a 0.00 ERA over 14 innings. She struck out 16 and scattered 10 hits and a walk. In wins over Slippery Rock and Mercyhurst, Tanilli hit .417 with a home run, four RBIs and three runs scored. • Penn State Behrend's AJ Nichols was named AMCC pitcher of the week after strong performances in three contests. Nichols tossed a pair of complete games to lead the Lions to wins over D'Youville and Mt. Aloysius. During her three appearances, Nichols piled up 21 strikeouts, including a season-high 12 against Mt. Aloysius, and allowed just 10 hits and three runs. BASEBALL • Penn State Behrend shortstop Scott Sada was named AMCC player of the week after he became the NCAA Division III leader in career doubles and piled up five extra-base hits and six RBIs to lead the Lions to a 2-2 record in doubleheaders against Medaille and Alfred State. Sada, a senior from Saegertown, set the career doubles mark with 82. He added four more doubles since then, padding his career total to 86. He now has 20 doubles on the season, giving him at least 20 in each of his four seasons with the Lions. He is hitting .354 with five homers, 17 stolen bases and 24 RBIs this season. • Behrend pitcher Phil Myers reached a career milestone by getting his 150th strikeout when he struck out four in a 9-8 win over Pitt-Bradford on Thursday. FOOTBALL • Former Edinboro standout Jake Sisson has gotten off to a good start at quarterback for the Kragujevac Wild Boars in the CEFL, the European Football League. Sisson has completed 40-of-58 passes for 895 yards and nine touchdowns without throwing an interception through his first three games of the season. He has also piled up 177 yards and three touchdowns on the ground while helping the Wild Boars move to 3-0. • Edinboro played its annual Red & White Spring Game on a rainy Friday night as the Red emerged with a 49-20 win. Points were awarded for defensive play as well, and Tarique Smith, a transfer defensive end from Lackawanna College, started the scoring with a 30-yard return of a fumble that was caused by Myles Turner. The top offensive highlights came from redshirt junior quarterback Andrew Tomko (Sharon) and freshman wide receiver Jon Long on a 75-yard drive. The two connected on a 37-yard pass and capped the drive with a 23-yard pass play for a touchdown. Long finished with three catches for 69 yards. Jordan Castelli, a transfer from Cal who will be a redshirt sophomore in the fall, completed 6-of-12 passes for 61 yards, and Andre Dowdell Jr. had five receptions for 80 yards. Maurice Sims and Sirvantis Dennis II had interceptions. TENNIS • Mercyhurst's Arseniy Sklyarov was named PSAC athlete of the week after posting a 4-0 record to help the Lakers to wins over Bloomsburg and Kutztown. The junior won both of his singles matches and teamed up with Ruaridh Fraser for a pair of doubles wins. TRACK AND FIELD •Edinboro's Stefanie Parsons and Corey Wefing were selected as PSAC outdoor track athletes of the week after strong performances in the 1,500-meter run against competitors from Division I, II and III at the Bison Outdoor Classic. Parsons, a sophomore, finished 12th with a personal best and school-record time of 4:25.91. Wefing finished 11th with a time of 3:46.84, finishing behind eight Division I runners while posting the top time in the Atlantic Region this season. • Penn State Behrend's Matt Michael, Emily Mischen and Riley Crissman were named CSAC athletes of the week after their performances at the Westminster Invitational. Michael, an Iroquois graduate, was named men's field athlete of the week after placing fourth in the shot put with the second longest throw in program history (14.61 meters). Mischen was the women's field athlete of the week after breaking the school's longest-standing track and field record with a heave of 11.11 meters in the shot put. Crissman earned women's track athlete of the week following her second-place finish in the 5,000 with a personal best of 18:27.11.<end_of_turn>

# The Latest: Hearing about missing boy's brother continued

CHICAGO – The Latest on the missing suburban Chicago 5-year-old boy (all times local):  7:20 p.m.  A custody hearing involving the brother of a missing suburban Chicago boy and their parents has been continued.  JoAnn Cunningham and Andrew Freund Sr., the parents of missing 5-year-old Andrew “AJ” Freund, appeared Tuesday in McHenry County Circuit Court. They are seeking custody of their 4-year-old son, Parker. He was taken into custody by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services on Thursday after Andrew was reported missing by his parents.  A new attorney is expected to be appointed to the 4-year-old on Wednesday after a conflict of interest was found with the boy’s current lawyer Tuesday.  The judge may determine who should have custody of the child on Monday.  Cunningham’s attorney, George Kililis, said Tuesday that the state made numerous allegations in its petition that “requires a lot of work for us.” He wouldn’t comment further.  ___  3:15 p.m.  Police reports indicate the 5-year-old boy who went missing from a suburban Chicago home had been living in squalor as recently as December when an officer dispatched to the scene said the “smell of feces” in a bedroom where children slept was overwhelming and that there was “dog feces and urine” throughout the home.  On Tuesday afternoon, the Crystal Lake Police Department released more than 60 pages of reports regarding several police visits to the home from which Andrew “AJ” Freund was reported missing last Thursday. The reports that were released in response to a Freedom of Information request are heavily redacted but the officers write that the house is “cluttered, dirty and in disrepair.”  In one case, police called for state child welfare workers after an officer notices a large bruise on the body of one of the children but the children were not removed from the home after the case worker is unable to determine what caused the bruise.  Police on Tuesday continue the search for the boy. They have said the boy’s mother has not cooperated with investigators.  ___  12:15 p.m.  Police have released a recording of the 911 call a suburban Chicago man made when he discovered his 5-year-old son was missing.  In the call made last Thursday, Andrew Freund Sr. tells a dispatcher that he arrived home from a doctor’s appointment to discover his son, Andrew “AJ” Freund, is gone. He says he searched the Crystal Lake house, garage, a park, and other locations but can’t find him. Police released the recording Tuesday.  Crystal Lake police meanwhile announced they are still searching a nearby park and using sonar equipment to search ponds in the area. Police have asked neighbors for surveillance video in the hunt for clues about the boy’s disappearance.  Police say they boy’s mother, JoAnn Cunningham, is refusing to cooperate with detectives.<end_of_turn>

# Alexa Chung finds 'brushing' eyebrows 'relaxing'

Alexa Chung finds ''brushing'' her eyebrows ''really relaxing'' and keeps them thick by not having them ''threaded''. Alexa Chung finds ''brushing'' her eyebrows ''really relaxing''. The model-turned-designer shapes her own brows rather than visiting a salon and though she religiously uses a spoolie tool on them, she admits that could be what ''stimulates'' their growth and makes them bushier - but still doesn't care. She said: ''I find brushing my eyebrows really relaxing. I don't know if brushing them is stimulating their growth and giving me a Frida Kahlo situation, but I'm really happy with them. I don't get them threaded, I just do them myself. ''Suqqu has this khaki green coloured brow pen. Apparently, it's really good because it doesn't look like you've actually coloured in your brow. It's more of a shading.'' And Alexa, 35, chooses to wear ''foundation less'' when the weather gets warmer and opts for a La Mer concealer to keep her complexion looking bright and flawless. She added: ''I'll get rid of some of last night's make-up, with some La Roche Posay make-up remover and a cotton bud. Then it's moisturiser - Augustinus Bader is my new thing, but it's hideously expensive. When that runs out, it's a bit of whatever is in the cupboard. Maybe Kiehl's Ultra Face Cream. And then I think I'm like a lab technician and I'll drop fancy oils in it, like Rodin Body Oil or whatever. And then I put it on. ''Then as we're going into spring, I wear foundation less - I like it to be natural. I like Glossier, or RMS Concealer or La Mer Concealer. Then I'm curling my eyelashes and putting Dr Paw Paw Balm on my mouth. I have little tiny iron filings for eyelashes. Blusher I'm a little wayward with - I'm not a faithful lover. But it will be a blush over a bronzer, usually a cream type one, and always coral one. For mascara, I like Charlotte Tilbury for night and Glossier for the day.'' The brunette beauty is devoted to hairdresser George Northwood, admitting using the services of someone else for a cut doesn't ''work out'' for her. She told Vogue UK: ''I was working recently with longer hair, and they asked me if I'd ever had a bob. And I thought, 'Isn't that my thing? I think that's my thing', and it reminded me to get it cut again. I only see George. I might need to go to couple's therapy with that. I did try and see other people, we were in an open relationship for a while because we were doing long distance, but it didn't really work out for me cut-wise. I don't mind seeing other people style-wise, but cut-wise I've had too many a dodgy thing done to it to trust again''<end_of_turn>

# Eagan man would “lose his cool” if he had to change child’s diaper. Pleads guilty in toddler’s beating death.

An Eagan man accused of fatally beating his girlfriend’s foster child after having to change the boy’s diaper pleaded guilty Tuesday to second-degree murder.  Charles Wayne Homich, 28, was indicted by a Dakota County grand jury in December with four counts of first-degree murder and two counts second-degree murder in connection with the 2017 death of 3-year-old Zayden Lawson.  On Tuesday, Dakota County District Judge Christopher Lehmann set sentencing for Aug. 13, and ordered that Homich remain in custody.  Lawson’s foster mother, 32-year-old Zeporia Dionn Fortenberry, was charged in April 2018 with two counts of manslaughter, according to a separate criminal complaint. The case against her is still pending.  Fortenberry’s babysitter, who is identified in the charges as “LB,” told investigators that Fortenberry regularly asked LB to care for the kids while she was at work because “she did not trust Homich with Lawson,” and that “Homich would ‘lose his cool’ if he had to change Lawson’s dirty diaper,” according to the criminal complaint against Homich.  Homich told investigators that he changed Lawson’s soiled diaper the night before the boy died, according to the complaint.<end_of_turn>

                     A 6.4 magnitude earthquake rocked the central Philippines on Tuesday, one day after another quake killed at least 16 people. Schools and offices in San Julian in Eastern Samar province suspended activities and officials cut off power as a precaution. No deaths were immediately reported in Tuesday’s quake. Monday’s quake struck near the town of Bodega on the Philippine island of Luzon. It brought down a supermarket and damaged other buildings, including an international airport terminal. Rescue workers searched the rubble for any survivors overnight. Since the initial quake, seismologists have recorded more than 400 aftershocks.

# Was Taylor Swift Promoting New Music With Her Outfit to Gigi Hadid’s Birthday Party?

Swifties, do you smell that? The mercurial aroma of an artist perpetually in flux who’s preparing to unveil new music (or something similar) on Friday, April 26? Why, yes, that is Taylor Swift trotting down the streets of New York City, ostensibly attending her good friend Gigi Hadid’s birthday party but in fact engaging in a blatant act of self-promotion. Let’s analyze, shall we? On Monday evening, the supermodel threw herself a denim-themed 24th birthday bash at L’Avenue in Manhattan, but Swift showed up looking decidedly prim in a fluttering floral slip dress, a red double-breasted houndstooth overcoat and soft pink velvet heels. Her baby blue purse was emblazoned with a picture of a cat on it, because of course it was. But the devil is in the details. Swift, as Observer has previously reported, has been teasing the date of April 26 on her Instagram by posting tantalizing visual clues regarding what she might be up to. These social media images, which have swelled to include an aesthetically coherent cover of Time magazine, a snapshot of an aquamarine bicycle and a picture of pastel-suited figures clutching cheerful briefcases, were mirrored in the decidedly twee outfit Swift chose for Gigi’s soiree. Even the dipped ends of her hair, like her Instagram posts, were pink. Swift’s bald-faced disregard for party etiquette and supermodel authority is particularly fascinating when you consider her history. Only a couple of years ago, you may recall, Swift’s messaging was fully focused around the idea of ride-or-die female friendship in large packs. In 2015, you couldn’t look at Instagram or the gossip press without being inundated with images of her “girl squad,” and back then, Swift probably would have leapt at the idea of adhering to the dress code at a buddy’s themed party. In 2019, it seems, not so much. While exchanging DMs last night with a friend, I summed up Swift’s new aesthetic as that of “a cake shop run by Pussy Hat moms.” I stand by this, but would like to add that I will gladly and willingly listen to whatever music she drops at her audience’s feet at the end of the week. The singer already knows this. I suspect she’ll make up for her lack of visual acumen with absolutely fire lyrics.<end_of_turn>

# Sachin Tendulkar Birthday Special: Reminiscing Desert Storm in Sharjah that stands the test of time- Firstcricket News, Firstpost

Editor's Note: This story first appeared on 24 April, 2018. It is being republished to mark Sachin Tendulkar's 46th birthday as well as the 21st anniversary of the second of his twin Desert Storm innings in Sharjah.  Twenty years is a long time. People age, governments change. Employees retire, marriages break. And yet, certain moments stand out like lone flagposts in an arid desert. Dust the memories, sift through crumbs, ransack the brain and swirl the cerebral space. You could be in college, or in secondary school, or getting married, or giving birth. You could be sitting in a job interview, or jumping off a cliff. You could be going through a myriad of emotions, but chances are, when you look back 20 years to this day, you can afford a wry smile. Nostalgia, you little beast.  1998 was a year of delicious possibilities. The headiness of being at the turn of a millennium, the gravity of leaving behind a legacy, a nation having just completed 50 years of freedom, the turgid incompleteness that the number itself holds — a gigantic figure that is two steps from fulfillment.  Reams have been written about sport’s power to blur boundaries. But ask an average sports fan, and more than diminished distances and political amity, it is sport’s less-celebrated trait to serve as a tool to measure time with that would leave you befuddled. Where were you when Bjorg-McEnroe happened, or when Ali’s cross floored Liston, or when the baton was passed from Sampras to Federer? Those who watched it, or know of it, can justifiably pose a similar query: What were you doing on 24 April, 1998?  It was a Friday, and India were playing in Sharjah. Word had it — so often and so ferociously was it repeated that one took it for truth — that India rarely win on a Friday, more so if it was a jumma in Sharjah. Word also had it — and this one was more compelling in its conviction, statistics be damned — that India rarely won when Sachin Tendulkar scored a century. 24 April, 1998 sought to change all that.  With Sourav Ganguly, Mohammed Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja and VVS Laxman in the team, India were hardly light on batting arsenal. The tragedy was, all the opposition needed to do was to get rid of one man, before others reduced themselves to nervous-wrecks. Tendulkar knew it. So for two days in the deserts of Sharjah, he held court in all his pomp. Like a victorious king who had felled an empire, Tendulkar floated in the humid Middle-East air, except that the ravages he looked over were of his own doing, for the emperor was an army in himself.  The destruction he designed, the carnage he created, the opposition he slayed and the ambitions he engendered were to be the coronation of all coronations, and in a career spanning 24 years, he did have quite a few of them.  Watching from the other end was another great, a magician himself who was reduced to a bedazzled artist as bedlam ensued. Shane Warne stood mid-pitch in crying disbelief. He swatted a fly across his face, but his eyes barely blinked. All his sight, all his mind, all the magic in his fingers, and the entire expanse of his experience stood defeated and dissected by the man standing in front of him, who had just ran at him, made room outside his leg-stump, took his leg-break on the full and deposited it over deep mid-wicket. Sixes had been hit off Warne before, but never had he run into a zoned-out, curly-haired birthday-boy with psychotic fury who had virtually held him by the collar and threw him off the precipice.  “I am sure, as a champion leg-spinner, Warne would have known how the ball left his fingers. Then he would have seen Sachin leave his crease, and he would have thought that his plan to draw Sachin out has worked. Except, Sachin hit him for a six. I think that’s why he stood perplexed,” says Hrishikesh Kanitkar, who hit the winning runs in that match.  Two days before, Tendulkar had hit his then career-best 143 in a losing cause against the same opposition, but India had scored enough to edge out New Zealand for a place in final. Then, in the virtual semi-final, as he hit a straight six after securing India’s passage to the final, the late Tony Greig had shrieked in his redoubtable screech, “Sachin Tendulkar is playing for victory.” In India, they nodded with a know-it-all grin. After all, it was nine years after national selector Naren Tamhane had told his colleagues of the 16-year-old boy-wonder with chilling finality, “Gentlemen, Tendulkar never fails.”  And he didn’t, not on the sweltering jumma of 1998. 134 runs flowed from his bat out of a team total of 275. Fourth of his nine hundreds against Australia, 14th of the 49 he would eventually hit, eighth of the 17 tons while chasing.  “I think he entered the zone that only musical genius are capable of. Think of Pink Floyd and AR Rahman, and the trance they enter. It’s a very special space to be in if you are a cricketer. It’s one thing to get into the position and play a stroke after the ball has been bowled, but watching Sachin bat that night, I can say he knew where the ball would be bowled even before it was delivered. I am sure he had the formula to enter that space at will, and that’s truly brilliant,” says Kanitkar.  In Damien Fleming, Michael Kasprowicz, Shane Warne, and Tom Moody, Australia had an enviable bowling attack. Tendulkar began with a tentative defence off Fleming that took the inside edge for the boundary. No other chances arrived for the next three hours. Steadily, he eased into his stride as stray notes fell into a rhythm before a thundering crescendo gobbled a nation in its vortex.  “We knew it was a good pitch. I just told the boys that if it (pitch) is good for them, it will be good for us too. In the mid-innings break, all I told Tendulkar was, ‘tere ko rukna nahi hai’ (You don’t have to stop). I’d say he played his best innings that night. I had never seen anyone bat like that before,” recalls then India coach Anshuman Gaekwad.  “Sachin completely demoralised the Aussies. One could see that they have lost all their confidence. After the final, I met Kasprowicz in the hotel, and he asked me how to get Tendulkar out. I simply told him, you can’t. Considering the form he was in, it was beyond any bowler to get him out, unless Tendulkar himself committed a mistake,” he adds.  The dressing room, Gaekwad says, was confident after a robust start from the top three.  “We had other good batsmen too, and if Sachin would have got out early, Ganguly would have looked to play through the innings. But I can tell you, Tendulkar wanted to do it on his own. He used to psyche himself. On the way to the stadium, in the team bus, he held my hand, and his palms were all sweaty. I told him to relax, and he said it was a good sign.”  Kanitkar recalls an emotionally-charged lot that watched the innings unfold in hypnotic disbelief.  “Adrenaline was running really high in the dressing room. We could see that he knew what the bowler was trying to do. I think we were in awe of his batting, because we knew how easy it looked from the outside and how tough it actually was in the middle,” he says.  “The best part about those two innings was that he never played a bad shot. It wasn’t as if the bowler had to bowl straight and Sachin would eventually miss an across the line shot and get out. All his strokes were well-timed and well-placed to the extent that even if he had mishit some, they would have landed safely,” Kanitkar says.  Two matches, two innings. It does take a while for a legend to be written, for a suitable sobriquet to be sought, for a fitting description to be forged. By the time the sweaty Friday night of 1998 gave way to dawn, two words had entered the cricketing lexicon: Desert Storm.  Where were you when it arrived?

# Desperately Seeking Lalu

RJD leaders and workers miss Lalu's rustic charm and unique campaigning style. M I Khan reports from Patna. Lalu Prasad Yadav's presence is being missed during the current Lok Sabha election campaign in Bihar.  It is the first time in three decades that Lalu is missing from campaigning in an election in Bihar.  Though the Rashtriya Janata Dal founder is convalescing at the Ranchi prison hospital -- recovering from a heart ailment -- the 'Lalu Phenonenon' is visible in several parliamentary constituencies. Dozens of RJD supporters, mostly youth, carry placards at election meetings, saying, 'Laluji we miss you, we need you'.  Sensing that RJD workers miss her husband's homespun humour and physical presence, former chief minister Rabri Devi declared recently that 'All RJD workers have become Laluji!'  Though her younger son Tejashwi Yadav is the RJD's campaigner-in-chief -- his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav is sulking and has mounted a revolt of sorts -- Rabri Devi is also campaigning in support of party candidates and Mahagathbandhan nominees.  She is intriguingly active on social media, tweeting regularly and requently interacting with the media.  "Tejashwi has learnt the tricks of politics fast," says a senior RJD leader, "he is articulate, attracts crowds, addresses four to five election meetings a day, but party workers and supporters are still searching for their leader, Lalu."  "Lalu's witty repartee and rustic mannerisms were the main source of attraction during his election meetings," explains another RJD leader. "This time it is missing and that has resulted in a dull campaign."  Tejashwi, adds this RJD leader, is no match for his father. "He has to learn a lot and also lack experiences," he says.  "Laluji could have made the task easy for the Mahagathbandhan to consolidate its social support base," says another RJD leader, "his absence is not good."  Though he is missing in action, Lalu still controls his party and decides the Mahagathbandhan's strategy from his prison hospital room.  Ignoring his elder son Tej Pratap's divorce petition, Lalu nominated his daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai's father as the RJD candidate from the Saran Lok Sabha seat.  Lalu also fielded Subhash Yadav from Chatra in neighbouring Jharkhand, ignoring a party revolt that led to the RJD Jharkhand president Annapurna Devi joining the Bharatiya Janata Party in protest.  Lalu also nominated his eldest child Dr Misa Bharti from the Patliputra seat, ignoring unhappiness in the RJD over his decision.  Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has questioned Lalu's ability to control political activities from his prison hospital bed. Prison authorities in Jharkhand twice conducted raids on Lalu's room, but found nothing objectionable.<end_of_turn>

# KKR vs RR Dream11 Prediction & Dotball Picks, Playing XI Updates & Fantasy Cricket Tips for Today's IPL Match - April 25th, 2019

KKR vs RR Dream11 Prediction & Dotball Picks, Playing XI Updates & Fantasy Cricket Tips for Today's IPL Match - April 25th, 2019  Two former IPL Champions currently fighting to keep their 2019 campaigns alive take centrestage as Kolkata Knight Riders look to arrest their losing streak at the expense of a depleted Rajasthan Royals side at the iconic Eden Gardens on Thursday. With the departure of their star opener, Jos Buttler, Rajasthan Royals have lacked the firepower in the first six overs which isn't the case with their opponents who have relied heavily upon Andre Russell and his blistering cameos. The previous KKR vs RR 2019 encounter was a merely a cakewalk for Dinesh Karthik and his men with Chris Lynn and Sunil Narine blazing their way to a comfortable win. While the IPL Points Table scenario bared a different look back then, this match holds a lot for both sides looking to bounce back into winning ways with the business end of the IPL 2019 fast approaching. Here are a few tips to help you pick your KKR vs RR Dream11 team. Squads to choose from: Kolkata Knight Riders: Dinesh Karthik (C), Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Shubman Gill, Andre Russell, Carlos Brathwaite, Piyush Chawla, Kuldeep Yadav, Prasidh Krishna, Prithvi Raj, Sandeep Warrier, Shrikant Mundhe, Harry Gurney, KC Cariappa, Joe Denly, Lockie Ferguson, Rinku Singh, Nikhil Naik, Matt Kelly Rajasthan Royals: Steve Smith (C), Ajinkya Rahane, Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Ashton Turner, Liam Livingstone, Prashant Chopra, Shashank Singh, Shubham Ranjane, Mahipal Lomror, Riyan Parag, Jofra Archer, Manan Vohra, Aryaman Birla, Rahul Tripathi, Stuart Binny, Shreyas Gopal, Krishnappa Gowtham, Ish Sodhi, Jaydev Unadkat, Dhawal Kulkarni, Varun Aaron, Oshane Thomas, S. Midhun  Playing XI Updates: Kolkata Knight Riders: After a lacklustre performance on Sunday in Hyderabad, KKR might be pondering the inclusions of Kuldeep Yadav, Robin Uthappa and Aussie, Matt Kelly. Harry Gurney was adjudged Man of the Match in the first KKR vs RR 2019 encounter but hasn't been able to sustain the same form over the next few matches which could see him drop out for Matt Kelly and his blistering yorkers. Shubman Gill hasn't been in the best of forms but could be persisted with ahead of Robin Uthappa. Possible XI: Lynn, Narine, Gill, Rana, Karthik(C&WK), Russell, Rinku, Chawla, Kelly/Gurney, Kuldeep and Prithviraj Rajasthan Royals: With this being the last game for the likes of Ben Stokes, RR would love to the get a win under the belt with Ajinkya Rahane also looking in sublime form at the top of the order. Steven Smith has led from the front with two fifties since taking over the reins as captain although he should be genuinely worried about the lack of wicket-taking options apart from the usual suspects, Shreyas Gopal and Jofra Archer. Ashton Turner's debut IPL hasn't gone according to plan but could be persisted with as he could play a major role in the coming days with the Englishmen leaving. Possible XI: Rahane, Samson(WK), Smith(C), Stokes, Turner, Binny, Parag, Kulkarni, Gopal, Archer and Unadkat. Match Details: Kolkata Knight Riders vs Rajasthan Royals, Indian Premier League 2019, Match 43 25th April 2019, 8:00 PM IST Eden Gardens, Kolkata Total Matches Played: 20 KKR: 10 RR: 9 No Result: 1 Matches in Kolkata: 7 (6 KKR 1 RR) Last 5 Matches: 4 KKR 1 RR Previous Encounters: Last Match: 7th April 2019: KKR (140-2, 13.5 overs) beat RR (139-3, 20 overs) by eight wickets, Jaipur Man of the Match: Harry Gurney (2/25) Last Match in Kolkata: 23 May 2018: KKR (169-7, 20 overs) beat RR (144-4, 20 overs) by 25 runs Man of the Match: Andre Russell (49 off 25) Fantasy Tips and Suggestions: Wicket-keeper: Sanju Samson is the preferred choice over KKR captain Dinesh Karthik and should put in a good performance on Thursday against a decent KKR bowling line-up. He wasn't able to trouble the scorers in the previous game but expect him to come good at the top of the RR batting unit. Batsmen: Chris Lynn and Steve Smith scored fifties in the previous outings for their respective teams and hold key on Thursday. Along with them, Nitish Rana is also a viable candidate with his ability to shift gears in the middle overs well known. One of Ajinkya Rahane or Ashton Turner should suffice as the fourth and final batting option in the KKR vs RR fantasy team. Allrounders: Andre Russell, Sunil Narine and Ben Stokes are three of the best all-rounders in T20 cricket and are must haves in any fantasy team regardless of the format. Although Ben Stokes has been subdued for the Royals over the past two seasons, he cannot be ignored given his unparalleled ability to make an impact in all three facets of the game. Bowlers: Jofra Archer and Shreyas Gopal have been threatening with the ball and should be considered for the fantasy team while the likes of Jaydev Unadkat and Piyush Chawla are also in the running. Kuldeep Yadav is all set to return to the playing XI and should be backed to come back strong for KKR. Captain: Chris Lynn is slowly but steadily coming back to his supreme best and should be backed to come up with a match-winning performance in the second KKR vs RR 2019 clash of the season while the likes of Steven Smith and Sunil Narine are also viable options for captaincy. Fantasy Suggestion for Dotball and Dream11 #1: Sanju Samson (WK), Chris Lynn, Nitish Rana, Steven Smith, Ashton Turner, Sunil Narine, Ben Stokes, Andre Russell, Kuldeep Yadav, Jofra Archer and Jaydev Unadkat. Captain: Chris Lynn Fantasy Suggestion for Dotball and Dream11 #2: Sanju Samson(WK), Chris Lynn, Shubman Gill, Steven Smith, Ashton Turner, Ben Stokes, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Shreyas Gopal, Jofra Archer and Piyush Chawla. Captain: Sunil Narine<end_of_turn>

# Oregon underclassmen have a strong start at men's golf Pac-12 Tournament

Oregon men's golf competed in the first day of the Pac-12 conference tournament in Eugene on Monday. The Ducks have a rare home course advantage in this year’s tournament, and they took full advantage in the first round on Monday with especially strong early showings by freshman Craig Ronne and sophomore Donald Kay. After the end of the first day, the Ducks are tied at sixth place with Colorado. The Ducks took 364 strokes in the first round and 353 strokes in the second round for a combined round score of 717 strokes. The day one leader was No. 17 Stanford, who ended the day with a score of 705 strokes. Oregon racked up a total of 124 pars, 40 birdies and one eagle. The second round of the tournament went noticeably faster than the first round as players of all teams settled into the course.  “The day went smoothly we stayed patient,” Kay said. The Ducks' underclassmen stole the show on day one. Kay and Ronne were the top two finishers for the Ducks. Ronne is currently tied at eight place in the tournament and Kay is tied for twelfth. “I wanted to contribute to the team and get some solid scores," Ronne said. "I got a lot of great advice from my teammates. There is going to be nerves, embrace it.” Kay added that home course advantage would be a good opportunity for the young players on the team. “This is the best tournament for us (underclassmen) taking the next step.” This tournament is a good opportunity for the young Ducks to springboard themselves to the next level, especially since the underclassmen had a strong showing at the Western Intercollegiate Tournament last week. This tournament was a large jump for Ronne, who played high school golf this time last year. “The level of competition has skyrocketed since high school golf.” Head Coach Casey Martin was pleased with the team’s results especially the young players. “Craig and Donald were in and out of the lineup all year and it's very encouraging that they are playing well. ... Hopefully we can get on all cylinders tomorrow.” Other notable finishers include Yin Ho Yue at 26th place, Tom Gueant at 32nd place, Ryan Gronlund at 35th place and Edwin Yi at 49th place.  One reason that the more junior Ducks players had a strong opening day was because they are familiar with the course. “I’ve played this course so many times,” said Kay when asked about how his knowledge of the course affected his game. Ronne added, “The intimidation factor isn't as present for us.” Indeed the Ducks' home course advantage could serve them well especially against strong competition such as Stanford, UCLA, California, USC, Arizona, Oregon State and Arizona State, who are all ranked opponents. The Sun Devils are currently the second-ranked team in the country, but are eighth after the first day in Pac-12s. Pac-12 conference tournament action continues Tuesday as the Ducks will have a full day of golf ahead of them.<end_of_turn>

# Tootsie | Marquis Theatre | Theater in New York

Time Out says  Broadway's Tootsie is great for a laugh.  Theater review by Adam Feldman  The most glorious words in the English language, the director of the show-within-a-show in 42nd Street once declared, are musical comedy. But few musicals on Broadway these days live up to the second part of that term: They evoke fond chuckles of appreciation, but they don’t suck the laughs from your belly. Enter Tootsie, all dolled up in a red sequined gown, to drag out the real comic goods. Let other shows mope or brood or inspire, as some of them do very well. This one is out to give you a good time, and that’s just what it does. Tootsie rocks. Tootsie rolls. Tootsie pops.  Santino Fontana, in the performance of his career to date, stars as Michael Dorsey, a talented but difficult actor whose professional clock is ticking. Broke, unemployable and newly 40 years old, he feels increasingly desperate: “Caught in the gap between ‘What the hell just happened’ and ‘What the hell is gonna happen next.’” Through a neurotic ex-girlfriend, Sandy (the magically amusing Sarah Stiles, in Bernadette Peters curls), he learns of an open role in an ill-conceived musical sequel to Romeo and Juliet called Juliet’s Curse. Disguised in glasses, a blue dress, a teased-out wig and a clipped Southern accent, he reinvents himself as an actress named Dorothy Michaels, auditions for the show—and lands the part.  Robert Horn’s crackerjack script, the funniest book of a Broadway musical since The Book of Mormon, evinces uncommon finesse in its approach to updating the revered 1982 movie to a modern-day setting, maintaining the material’s farcical core while massaging aspects of the film that have aged less well than others—including the fact that its central arc is, unavoidably, a straight-white-guy learning curve. A second-act shift in Michael’s relationship with his costar and love interest, Julie (Lilli Cooper), is just one of the cocktail’s twists.  This is the rare musical in which the book outshines the score. At their best, David Yazbek’s songs are densely wordy and nervy; elsewhere, they are merely agreeable, and sometimes a skosh underbaked. But Tootsie is packed with great zingers and character jokes, and director Scott Ellis’s bright, snappy production has assembled a murderer’s row of actors to put them over: the wonderfully comfy Andy Grotelueschen as Michael’s sardonic roommate; John Behlmann as a handsome reality-TV hunk with washboard abs and a washout brain; the priceless Julie Halston as a rich producer; Reg Rogers as a slimy director; Michael McGrath as a fed-up agent. Though it pokes a lot of fun at them, Tootsie is a show that loves actors. They love it right back, and they lift it to glory.  Marquis Theatre (Broadway). Music and lyrics by David Yazbek. Book by Robert Horn. Directed by Scott Ellis. With Santino Fontana, Lilli Cooper, Sarah Stiles, Andy Grotelueschen, John Behlmann.<end_of_turn>

# NBCUniversal Has ‘Begun Internal Discussion’ Over Taking ‘The Office’ Off Netflix

NBCUniversal Has ‘Begun Internal Discussion’ Over Taking ‘The Office’ Off Netflix  “The Office” might not be on Netflix much longer.  The Wall Street Journal wrote the following Wednesday:  Netflix Inc. may soon have to contemplate life without its No. 1 show. It’s “The Office.”  NBCUniversal, which owns the show, licensed reruns of the comedy to the streaming-video giant years ago. Now NBCUniversal is launching its own streaming service, and has begun internal discussions about removing “The Office” from Netflix when the contract expires in 2021, according to people familiar with the situation. My friends, smash the panic button as hard as you can. Smash it immediately. The year of 2021 might sound like it’s far away, but that’s under two years.  That’s pretty much the blink of an eye from being over. It’ll be 2021 before we even know what happened. We simply can’t stand for the hit show from leaving Netflix. We won’t allow it!  If NBCUniversal thinks I’m buying their streaming service, they’ve got another thing coming. It’s just not going to happen. If they pull the show off of Netflix, then it will just disappear into the darkness of the internet. That’s a tragedy on an epic scale. (RELATED: Netflix Streams 164.8 Million Hours Of Video Every Day)  What will I watch after work? What will I watch during lunch? What will I watch when enjoying a beer on the weekend?  What will we do without “The Office” on Netflix? Don’t let this happen, Netflix. Do whatever it takes. Do literally whatever it takes to stop this disaster from becoming our reality.<end_of_turn>

# BOJ to paint bleak inflation outlook, keep policy steady

BOJ to paint bleak inflation outlook, keep policy steady  By Leika Kihara  TOKYO, April 25 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is expected to keep monetary policy steady on Thursday and predict that inflation will fall short of its 2 percent target for three more years, signalling that its massive stimulus will stay in place for the foreseeable future.  Given their dwindling policy tool-kit, BOJ officials have made clear that subdued inflation alone won't trigger additional easing, and that the central bank will act only if risks threaten to derail Japan's economic recovery.  But slowing global demand and simmering trade tensions have hurt Japan's exports and business sentiment, putting the test to the BOJ's projection the economy will keep expanding moderately.  With uncertainty over a scheduled sales tax hike in October also clouding the outlook, some analysts expect the BOJ to change its forward guidance in coming months to give markets more clarity on how long interest rates will remain very low.  "If the BOJ were to downgrade its inflation forecast, changing the forward guidance could be among options," said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.  "But the BOJ likely won't do it this time," because markets already expect any rate hike to be some time away, he added.  At a two-day meeting ending on Thursday, the BOJ is expected to maintain its short-term rate target at minus 0.1 percent and a pledge to guide long-term yields around zero percent. It is also expected to reiterate it will keep buying assets such as government bonds and exchange-traded equity funds.  In quarterly projections also due on Thursday, the BOJ may slightly cut its growth and price forecasts for the current fiscal year ending in March 2020, sources have told Reuters. It will also project inflation to move above 1.5 percent but fall short of 2 percent in fiscal 2021, they said.  Such projections will underscore a dominant market view that heightening risks and soft inflation will keep major central banks from whittling down crisis-mode policies any time soon.  Under forward guidance adopted last year, the BOJ pledged to keep rates very low for an "extended period" given uncertainties such as the impact of this year's sales tax hike on the economy.  Some analysts say the BOJ could tweak the language to reassure markets that rates will stay ultra-low long after the tax increase takes place.  "The BOJ could extend its forward guidance and commit to maintaining current monetary easing at least through 2020," said Hiroshi Ugai, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Securities.  Ugai said the BOJ could make the tweak on Thursday, though most analysts expect any such change to happen later this year.  Despite some government steps to soften the tax blow, analysts polled by Reuters expect it will briefly knock the economy into contraction in the fourth quarter.  Years of heavy money printing have failed to fire up inflation to the BOJ's 2 percent target and left it with little ammunition to fight the next recession.  Prolonged easing has also added to stresses on regional banks, already facing slumping profits due to an ageing population and an exodus of borrowers to big cities.  Under current projections, the BOJ expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.1 percent in the year ending in March 2020 and accelerate to 1.5 percent next year. That is much higher than projections in a Reuters poll of 0.7 percent inflation this fiscal year and 0.8 percent the following year.

# Netflix Swears Everything’s Fine As a Future Without The Office Looms

Break out your sweaty Michael Scott GIFs, because Netflix is staring down a significant threat to its business—whether the streamer wants to admit it or not. According to The Wall Street Journal, licensed content from WarnerMedia, Disney, and NBCUniversal draw 40 percent of viewing time on the platform—which foreshadows quite the predicament as all three companies plan streaming services of their own. When they launch, each company will likely remove their shows from Netflix—or, at best, agree to share the content rather than licensing it exclusively. Netflix has long been preparing for this inevitability, putting together a bursting slate of its own originals. (The streamer has also been biding its time by making massive investments where necessary to hold onto series like Friends for as long as possible.) But according to the Journal, those shows garner only a fraction of viewing time that the old reliables do. In total, the Journal, citing Nielsen data, reports that the streaming service’s non-original “library programming” comprised 72 percent of the minutes people spent watching Netflix as of October. Eight of the platform’s 10 most-watched shows in the U.S. for 2018, in terms of minutes spent, were reruns as well. Among those top 10 shows were The Office, the platform’s current No. 1, and Parks and Recreation, both of which belong to NBC. WarnerMedia’s Friends, which originally aired on NBC, also placed in the top 10, as did Disney’s Grey’s Anatomy, which airs on ABC. A contributing factor could be that most Netflix originals have far fewer episodes than library series made originally for broadcast, which have both more seasons on average and more episodes per season. Netflix has clearly been preparing for this moment not only on the business side, but also on the P.R. side. The company’s Twitter account fired off a breezy tweet soon after the Journal report’s release, writing, “Hello it’s me with your regularly scheduled reminder that The Office will be on Netflix until 2021—at least!” In the article itself, a representative for Netflix said that the company doesn’t comment on third-party data—but added that viewership time on specific shows is a flawed metric, both because originals have fewer episodes and because such measurements discount film performance. “Focusing on the individual shows and films members choose and watch is more valuable than how much time they spend on one series vs. another,” the representative said. On an earnings call last week, the Journal reports, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said Netflix’s originals are “the shows that our members most value us for, and the things that we really pay a lot of attention to.” Subscribers’ time spent on originals, Sarandos added, is consistently growing. But none of Netflix’s explanations do much to allay the concrete fact that at this moment, it appears that licensed content makes up a huge amount of its business—and that well seems likely to run dry within the next few years. Netflix can hope that those striking out on their own will choose to share shows like The Office and Friends—a decision that’s not completely out of the question, since, as the Journal notes, those companies must consider the shows’ profit participants (including their cast and creators) while making licensing decisions. (If, say, the creators of The Office were to see a nosedive in their take-home pay after The Office moves from Netflix to NBC, exclusively, the Journal notes they could possibly sue—and such a decline could also dissuade creators from partnering with NBC in the future.) Either way, in the words of Michael Scott, “Oh my God, it’s happening.” A spokesperson for Netflix did not immediately respond to V.F.’s request for comment.

# Former Aston Villa boss still in frame for return to management

Former Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood remains in the frame for the QPR managerial position, despite ruling himself out.  The club are yet to replace Steve McClaren as manager, and it seems Sherwood could still have a role to play.  The former Tottenham boss had been strongly linked with the position following McClaren’s sacking on April 1, but was understood to have pulled out of the race to take over.  However, QPR director of football Les Ferdinand told Sky Sports News that Sherwood was still a candidate, along with Mark Warburton and Darren Moore.  Sherwood on Grealish  Jack Grealish should be playing for England and would be by now if he had signed for Tottenham Hotspur, according to Tim Sherwood.  But the bid they made in the final week of the window was rejected, with Villa's owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens not prepared to sell the 23-year-old after their takeover.  Grealish missed a period of the season with an ankle injury but has been in scintillating form since making his return in March.  Dean Smith’s side have won nine matches in a row since then as they aim to go one better than last season in their bid to return to the Premier League.  Sherwood has raved about Grealish’s talent before and the former Villa and Spurs boss has he-iterated his belief that the midfielder needs a top-flight platform on which to impress.  He told Sky Sports: "There's a player there in Jack Grealish who should be playing for England in my opinion.  "I've said it time and again if he went to a Premier League club or got that move to Tottenham that fell through at the last hour, he'd be playing for England no doubt."

"So, he’s a player we know all about, he’s a player we track.  "But that last bit of evidence that could give you confidence to pick him at the moment we won’t see. But as an ex-Villa man I hope it’s not too long before we do see it.”  Spurs have continued to track Grealish with reports they could try to sign him again amid doubts over the future of Christian Eriksen.<end_of_turn>

# How prison closures would affect small NY communities

PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (WCAX) Gov. Andrew Cuomo plans to close up to three New York state prisons.  He says the crime rate is going down and fewer people are being locked up, so the state doesn't need as many prisons.  Criminal justice reform is a big part of Cuomo's focus and he has said many times that prisons are not a jobs program. But communities that have prisons have other thoughts.  Prison jobs make up a large sum of North Country salaries. Most of the state prisons are located in small, rural towns. So, how would a prison closure impact these communities? Our Kelly O'Brien went to one town to find out.  Sixteen miles northwest of Plattsburgh, you will stumble upon Altona.  "Picturesque, I guess you'd say," Altona Town Supervisor Larry Ross said.  The town spans 100-square miles with a population of just 2,900.  "Nice little community, everybody is kind of close, everybody pretty much knows each other," Ross said.  One of the largest employers in the area is the Altona Correctional Facility, a medium security state prison. What was once the school for Altona is now the home to 500 inmates.  "There are employees from everywhere just about in the area, of course, that's how prison systems work," Ross said.  In his latest State of the State address, Governor Cuomo announced up to three state prisons will close. Three prisons have already closed in this district in the last nine years.  "I suppose you're always on the radar when they start looking to close," Ross said.  "We just can't continue to take this hit and I will continue to fight tooth and nail to make sure prisons in my district are spared from that," said Assemblyman D. Bill Jones, D-Chateaugay.  It's unknown if Altona will be on the chopping block, but if it is...  "It would be a ghost town, everything would be closed," said Jeff Forkum of Peru, New York. "It would be like the depression."  Ross says the prison has many benefits to Altona. Not only do those employed spend money locally for lunches, but the inmates also work to spruce up the community.  "They help us out, have work crews come out and clean the park," Ross said.  Community members fear a closure would lengthen their commutes or force them to move altogether.  "That created a life for people here. You take their life away, then they need to travel somewhere. It will cost them more money to live," Forkum said.  The governor says the Department of Corrections has until Sept. 1 to announce which prisons will close and relocate all employees and inmates.<end_of_turn>

# It shouldn't matter when you file for Social Security in theory, but in reality, it does

If you're planning on relying solely on your social security check for retirement, you may want to reconsider. Here's why. USA TODAY Chances are, Social Security will wind up playing a huge role in your retirement finances. Such is the case for many seniors, which is why recipients are advised to act strategically and file at the right time. Though your Social Security benefits are determined based on your top 35 years of earnings, the age at which you file for them could cause that number to go up, go down or stay the same. If you claim Social Security at full retirement age, or FRA, you'll get the exact monthly benefit your earnings record renders you eligible for. Here's what FRA looks like: That said, you certainly don't have to file for Social Security at FRA. You can start collecting benefits as early as age 62 and reduce them in the process, or you can delay benefits past FRA and boost them by 8% a year up until age 70. Many seniors rack their brains trying to land on the right age to file for Social Security, because they know how much it'll affect their benefits. But in theory, you actually shouldn't have to worry about when you file. Social Security's break-even setup One lesser-known fact about Social Security is that the program is designed to pay you the same total lifetime benefit regardless of when you initially file. The logic is that filing ahead of FRA will reduce your benefits, but that reduction will be offset by the greater number of individual payments you collect in your lifetime. On the flipside, filing after FRA will raise your benefits, but you'll collect fewer individual payments to counteract that boost. As such, it technically shouldn't matter when you file for Social Security. In reality, however, it does, and here's why: This break-even formula works only when you live an average life expectancy. If you expect to die sooner than the typical senior, then it generally pays to claim Social Security as early as possible, because in doing so, you'll come away with a larger lifetime payment. And if you expect to outlive your peers, then it usually pays to do the opposite – file for benefits as late as possible. Here's how that might play out in terms of actual numbers. Imagine you're entitled to a $1,500 monthly benefit at an FRA of 67. Filing at 62 will reduce your monthly benefit to $1,050, but you'll collect 60 more payments. If you live until roughly 78½, you'll pretty much break even with about $209,000 in lifetime Social Security income. If you die at 75, however, you'll come out about $20,000 ahead by filing at 62 instead of 67. Social Security's survival: Program faces a cash crunch in the years ahead When waiting won't work: 3 scenarios for claiming Social Security early Now let's run the opposite scenario, where you delay benefits until age 70, thereby increasing each monthly payment from $1,500 to $1,860. You'll break even with $279,000 in total Social Security income at age 82½. But if you live until age 85, you'll come out about $11,000 ahead by filing at 70 instead of 67. And if you live until 90, filing at 70 will allow you to come out more than $32,000 ahead. That's why your health must play a role in your decision to file for Social Security. If it's great, you might consider delaying benefits as long as possible. If it's poor, you might think about filing as soon as you're eligible. Or, you might land somewhere in the middle. The key, however, is to run different scenarios to see which ones allow you to come out ahead. Even though Social Security is designed to pay you the same total lifetime benefit regardless of the filing age you land on, many seniors ultimately find that the program doesn't actually work that way in practice.

# 3 Suspects Arrested With 21 Hand Grenades, 6 Swords In Sri Lanka

Police in Sri Lanka on Thursday arrested three suspects during a raid in Colombo and seized 21 hand grenades, six swords and a van. The raid was carried out by the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) and the Special Task Force (STF) personnel in the city's Modara area, the Daily Mirror reported. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan police spokesman, Ruwan Gunasekera told CNN that more than 70 suspects have been arrested across the country since the Easter Sunday bombings that claimed the lives of 359 people and injured over 500 others. He said the suspects have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism, aiding and abetting and conspiracy to commit terrorism. Ruwan Gunasekera added that the four most serious cases are in the custody of the Terrorism Investigation Department (TID). A further 33 suspects are in custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). All remaining suspects are being held by local police. The majority of the suspects were arrested in Colombo, four of which are women. All of the suspects are from Sri Lanka and most are family members and friends of the suicide bombers that carried out the carnage.

# Seidman: The solution to climate change, from the Veggie Van man

New College of Florida alum and environmental activist Josh Tickell has an answer for curing global warming ... and it doesn't even require you to give up eating meat  New College of Florida alum Josh Tickell returned to his old stomping grounds this week for Earth Day, bringing a message of hope and optimism to counter climate change doomsayers: Global warming is not only stoppable, it’s reversible. “The real option for moving forward is regeneration,” said the author, filmmaker and 20-year veteran of the environmental movement whose 2017 book, “Kiss the Ground,” promotes the potential of soil to reverse climate change. “We don’t just want to sustain where we are now, we want to draw down the carbon and balance the climate. Regenerative agriculture is really the only option for stabilizing human civilization moving forward.” If you’re thinking that sounds a little out there, it wouldn’t be the first time Tickell has raised eyebrows. The 1993 grad became a “green” celebrity as the creator of the “Veggie Van,” a Winnebago painted with sunflowers that converted used French fry oil to clean-burning biodiesel fuel, based on a theory in Tickell’s senior thesis. He and a friend spent two years traversing the country smelling like a mobile McDonald’s, while appearing on the Today Show, Good Morning America, NPR and in countless publications. Now the longtime advocate of cutting-edge ecological techniques has turned his focus to climate change, insisting the path to saving civilization can only be found in adopting a global ideology, where the environment, people and the culture are linked and simultaneously nurtured and improved. “When you look at the huge threats we face as a planet now, they are all ecologically related,” he said. “When a society outstrips its resource base and leadership fails to imagine new ways, it crumbles. So how we play this game is going to determine where we end up.” His solution — slightly dumbed down for those of us whose forte is not science — goes like this: Modern petroleum-fueled agriculture, focused on industrial efficiencies and profits, has pumped up to 70 percent of the soil’s carbon into the atmosphere. That’s left us with a “legacy load” of 1,000 gigatons of CO2 in the air that would linger even if all emissions stopped today. All that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere overheats the planet, whereas CO2 in the ground is beneficial, increasing the fertility of the soil, feeding plants, nurturing bigger and better crops and decreasing ocean acidification. So if we can “draw down” the carbon in the atmosphere and sequester it in the soil, we can solve two problems at once — stopping the warming and feeding the masses. The best way to make that happen, Tickell said, is through regenerative farming, which is based on the simple and ancient principle that if you nurture and protect the soil, it will reciprocate with bountiful crops. Using methods like composting, biodiversity and perennial plants rather than tilling, monocultures and overuse of chemicals, those harvests will not only produce more food for a growing world population but keep CO2 in the ground, where it belongs. “Problem solved,” Tickell said, smiling. “This is the ‘do less harm’ idea. The majority of CO2 is in the soil, and if we remove it, we’ve reduced the amount of land available to make food. Where does it go? The majority goes into the air. Yet every year, the soil almost sucks down all the CO2 we put in the atmosphere. We can’t put more of our legacy load in oceans or the atmosphere, we can only put it in the soil. And the soil is very large place to put the load because plants take in CO2.” Researchers have estimated we could sequester 6 gigatons of carbon dioxide a year just by planting the right kind of crops, more than compensating for the 4.3 gigatons humans are currently emitting. So we could not only stop temperatures from rising, we could even make a dent in the damage we’ve already done. “We’re not just looking at the changing of a desert into an ecosystem,” Tickell said, “we’re looking at reversing global warming.” Is all of this realistic? Only if farmers and governments get on board and people change the way they eat, shop and live. For the average Joe it would mean buying local, composting, reducing waste, planting trees and supporting governmental changes in food production. It doesn’t, however, mean you have to go vegan; healthy soil and sustainable ecological farming are compatible with raising animals, when cattle graze the natural landscape rather than bulk up on grain in feedlots. Tickell is finishing a film, “Life After Carbon,” due to be released before the 2020 election (“I promise”). It focuses on members of the Millennial and Gen Z generations now entering politics who he believes will “seize the moral authority” and force a change in approach. It’s up to them to “do everything possible to make it happen,” he said, while it's up to the rest of us to mentor, get out of the way and “not be negative about it.” Tickell’s talk began against a backdrop projection of the famous “Earthrise” photo, the first color image of our planet taken from space during the Apollo 8 mission in 1968. He called the reaction to the picture a “pivotal moment.” “Before this time, we had no context of all being together on one blue ball hurtling through space,” he said. “Then, suddenly, there was the immutable proof that no matter who we are, we are together.” Just as we couldn’t conceptualize that global connection until we saw the photo, Tickell said, so has the post-war generation been unable to grasp the idea of a regenerative society that can be holistic and synergistic rather than territorial and compartmentalized. But younger generations can — and do. “We don’t have a term for it yet — it’s aspirational beyond capitalism, beyond socialism, beyond border,” he said. “We want sustainability, to be done with the destructive economy. But what we’re talking about now is an economy of abundance, something so hard to conceptualize because we’ve never had it. Allow yourself to believe there is the possibility that the future might just work out.” Contact columnist Carrie Seidman at 941-361-4834 or carrie.seidman@heraldtribune.com.

# That Avengers: Endgame Post-Credits Tribute is Subtle and Perfect

This post contains frank discussion of the most crucial plot points in Avengers: Endgame. If you’re looking for a spoiler-free, risk-free review, you can find it here. But if you’re about to wander into the article below, it means that you have either already seen the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or that you really, truly don’t mind knowing what’s to come. We’re going to give you one last chance to bail out—but after this GIF, the gauntlets are coming off. There is no traditional Marvel end of credits scene or teaser in Avengers: Endgame, but there is a little treat for patient fans who sat through the movie’s very, very, very, long credits sequence. Listen closely and you’ll hear some clanging. Does it sound familiar? Disney has confirmed that the sound you hear is Tony Stark building his first makeshift Iron Man suit in the M.C.U. movie that started it all. Speaking of which, do you ever go back and look at movie trailers after you’ve seen the film itself? This Avengers: Endgame trailer is an especially fun one. Notice just how much of the film is actually teased in this promo. First of all it starts, as Endgame finishes, with a nod to Tony, that armor, and the cave it was was forged in. We even get a shot of the arc reactor emblazoned with “Proof Tony Stark Had a Heart” that acts as his funereal token in Endgame. The entire premise of the trailer—a tour back through previous installments in the M.C.U.—is, obviously, a nod to the “time heist” plot of Endgame. It’s also worth paying attention to the snippet of elderly Peggy Carter’s speech from The Winter Soldier that they decided to include here. “The world has changed,” she tells Cap. “None of us can go back. All we can do is our best and sometimes the best we can do is start over.” Well, isn’t that exactly what Steve did? Go back and start over? “We owe this to everyone who is not in this room to try,” Natasha says as Clint puts his hand on her shoulder. If that’s not a nod to the circumstances around her death, then I don’t know what is. The whole thing ends with a chorus of the Avengers saying “whatever it takes” and the last voice we hear is Tony’s. Another nod to the film’s most significant death. Trailers are supposed to tease what’s to come but the secrecy around Avengers: Endgame was through the roof and there were plenty of complaints from eager fans that too much was being held back. How much fun, then, do you think the Marvel publicity team had in cutting this trailer together which gives both everything and nothing away at the same time?<end_of_turn>

# Chargers select DT Jerry Tillery in first round | WTOP

COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) — The Los Angeles Chargers addressed their need at defensive tackle in the first round, selecting Notre Dame’s Jerry Tillery with the 28th overall pick.  Tillery was a second-team selection to The Associated Press All-America team after leading the Fighting Irish in sacks (eight) and forced fumbles (three). He had 30 tackles, including 10½ for loss, and five quarterback hurries to help lead Notre Dame to the College Football Playoff semifinals.  The 6-foot-7, 305-pound Tillery played in 50 games during his collegiate career and recorded 13½ sacks. He had shoulder surgery in March but is expected to be ready by the start of the season. Los Angeles tied for the best regular-season record in the AFC last season at 12-4, but depth on the defensive line has taken a hit during the offseason. They released Corey Liuget prior to the start of free agency while Darius Philon and Damion Square departed as unrestricted free agents. The Chargers have one of the better defensive end combinations in the league in Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram and they re-signed Brandon Mebane to man one of the defensive tackle spots.  This is the third time in the past four years that general manager Tom Telesco has taken a defensive player in the first round. He selected Bosa with the third overall pick in 2016 and took safety Derwin James 17th overall last year.  The Chargers still have needs at linebacker, free safety and guard, which they are expected to address on Friday and Saturday.  ___  Follow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy  ___  More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL  Copyright © 2019 The Associated Press.

# IPL 2019: KKR still have a healthy dressing room, says Brathwaite

IPL 2019: KKR still have a healthy dressing room, says Brathwaite  Kolkata Knight Riders practised without Dinesh Karthik on the eve of their IPL match against Rajasthan Royals and may look like things are falling apart for SRK franchise, but Carlos Brathwaite said they that the team environment is still good  KKR have lost 5 matches on the trot under Dinesh Karik and it may look like the team confidence has been cracked and the team room atmosphere is not positive as KKR are on the verge of elimination with five losses in a row, the latest coming against Sunrisers Hyderabad at Eden Gardens on Sunday. The KKR teams think tank decided to give the under pressure and underperforming Dinesh Kartik a few days off to rejuvenate himself and come back stronger than ever.  Skipper Dinesh Karthik, along with the middle order duo of Robin Uthappa and Shubman Gill who were training in Mumbai, checked in late in the evening but KKR all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite said the mood in the camp was absolutely fine and there is nothing to worry about.  "I think the mood in the camp is good. We are still teasing each other. As a professional player, you cannot allow results to alter your demeanour or your mindset," Brathwaite said.  "If you allow that then the remaining four games will be even harder. We still laugh out at each other. We are still a healthy dressing room. I feel privileged to be part of it. I still enjoy coming to work practising and realising the game better."  The main team regular players were not to be seen in the match-eve practice sessions, and the Windies T20 skipper, who has played just one match this season, was sent for the media interaction on the eve of their game.  Brathwaite said the KKR team do not have a leadership group per se and anyone who is a born-leader can contribute.  "If you are a leader by nature, then that will come on in whatever you say, and do, and how you say things and how you do it. I've been speaking in team meetings, speaking to the coach, to the captain to the manager. I think a leader is natural, it's something that happens. I see myself as one.  KKRs biggest letdown this season has been their bowling department as they have not been able to give regular breakthroughs.  "I just don't want to single out bowling unit because as a team we haven't played cricket collectively that we want. I don't think we batted as well as we want. It will be unfair to single out the bowlers," he said.  KKR have to win all their remaining four matches from here on and the Windies all-rounder said they're in search of the win and then carry forward from there on. "We just need to find a spark from somewhere either individually or collectively to arrest the slide and maintain that momentum in the business part of the tournament.  "I prefer to have six losses, rather than having them in the last six games and then being knocked out. So as a team, we haven't been good enough. Full stop. It's a matter of getting better and putting out the perfect game together," he said.  West Indies are yet to select their World Cup squad and Brathwaite said he's a bit nervous but the focus for him is only on KKR at the moment.  "I am a little nervous. It's a privilege to represent your nation whenever you get the chance to. In a World Cup, it's even more prestigious occasion. So if selected looking forward to being given my best but for now, my job is with KKR.  "As a franchise, they selected me to come and do my best, so it would be disrespectful of me to be looking too far ahead at the World Cup when we still have four games potentially seven looking to win a Cup.".  Kolkata Knight Riders will look at tonight's match against Rajasthan as an opportunity to bounce back and shrug off the poor run of form they have had this year.    Here's how Sachin Tendulkar continues to enjoy life post retirement<end_of_turn>

# Asia: Markets mostly down after mixed lead from Wall Street

You are here  Asia: Markets mostly down after mixed lead from Wall Street [HONG KONG] Asian markets mostly fell on Friday with investors treading carefully as global slowdown worries return to the fore, with analysts pointing to an economic divergence between the US and the rest of the world.  Traders have been cheered by a string of better-than-expected earnings from corporate titans this reporting season, with Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon adding to the positive mood on Wall Street, but were unable to fuel broad gains.  However, there have been a couple of misses from other top firms, while crucially a series of downbeat data and central bank caution have dampened spirits.  Central banks in Japan, Sweden, Turkey and Ukraine, with an eye on the global outlook, on Thursday took a dovish turn and flagged softer policy in the near future. That came after a growth forecast cut by the Bank of Canada. Meanwhile low inflation has led to speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia could soon cut borrowing costs, while the European Central Bank is battling weak eurozone growth. On top of that, a drop in German business confidence fanned worries about the bloc's biggest economy, while South Korea saw its worst performance in 10 years during the first quarter.  But while the Federal Reserve has said it will not likely raise interest rates this year the US economy continues to outpace its peers and the jobs markets is flourishing, with Wall Street hitting new records this week. Eyes are now on the release of US growth data later Friday.  "While positive earning numbers have lent massive support to US equities, it's hard to ignore the inescapable fact that we are back to the divergent economic narrative where the US economy is on fire while ice water continued to pour over the rest of the globe," said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management.  Shanghai dropped 0.5 per cent in the morning, extending losses of more than two per cent Thursday as investors fret that a run of market-supporting stimulus measures aimed at supporting the economy could be coming to an end.  Tokyo ended the morning down 0.7 per cent, Seoul shed 0.4 per cent and Singapore added 0.1 per cent.  There were also losses in Taipei, Wellington and Jakarta.  However, Hong Kong rose 0.3 per cent after suffering five straight days of decline.  The broad losses come at the end of a tough week for markets, which have enjoyed a blockbuster start to the year, thanks to hopes for China-US trade talks.  On oil markets both main contracts continued to fall after this week, hitting six-month highs as traders await the response from Opec and Russia after the US said it would not extend waivers that allow certain countries to buy crude from sanctions-hit Iran.  Observers said that after the jump in prices, selling was to be expected owing to a number of factors including the China-US trade talks, unrest in Libya, Venezuela's political crisis and the Opec-Russia output caps.

# Tallmadge approves Tobacco 21 legislation

TALLMADGE — Those wishing to purchase tobacco products at city retailers must now be at least 21 years of age. Council on Thursday voted 6-1 in favor of legislation raising the minimum legal sales age for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and vaping products, from 18 to 21. Council member James Donovan cast the dissenting vote. The legislation, nicknamed “Tobacco 21,” is being promoted through an initiative by Summit County Public Health. The legislation makes it illegal for businesses to sell cigarettes, tobacco products and other tobacco product paraphernalia to anyone under 21. Donna Skoda, health commissioner for Summit County Public Health, said she was thrilled that council approved the legislation. “This is really an issue around protecting health,” said Skoda, who attended Thursday’s meeting. “It’s my job as health commissioner to bring these issues forward ... We’re happy because anything we can do to protect and eliminate the next generation of smokers, I’m all about.” Even though he mostly cited several reasons against the new law and said, “I don’t support growing government,” Councilman Dennis Loughry said he supported the legislation. He noted he learned from the school resource officer and school district administrators how addictive vaping products are. “I know how hard the nicotine addiction is to kick and the harm it does to your body over time,” said Loughry. “I truly believe that if parents aren’t going to parent, then government needs to do what it can to help protect children. Even if the gesture is mostly symbolic ... It is our job to try and protect those who can’t protect themselves.” While noting he understood the concerns about health issues, Donovan said he felt the law was penalizing people who are considered adults and are purchasing a legal product. “We’re targeting people who are using something legally,” he said. “We’re taking the rights of somebody who now is not banned from using a product. They’re considered adults. ... We’re infringing on their rights.” He added he was also not in favor of “patchwork laws,” where people can drive to a neighboring city to purchase an item that they are unable to buy in their home city. Mayor Dave Kline said he supported the legislation and was glad to see Council backing it. The mayor added the state is looking at the possibility of adopting legislation. Skoda noted statewide legislation is being developed by Gov. Mike DeWine and Dr. Amy Acton, director of Ohio Department of Health. “I believe this legislation targets the wrong entities for punishment,” said Loughry. “In my opinion, the purchaser must be held accountable.” A business would not face a penalty for a first violation, according to the legislation. A second violation would result in a $500 civil fine, and subsequent violations would prompt a $1,000 civil fine. The fines will go toward efforts to prevent those under 21 from smoking or to promote smoking cessation. Summit County Public Health will enforce the rule and issue the fines, with inspections and undercover purchases. Law Director Megan Raber said there are not any retailers in the Portage County part of Tallmadge that sell nicotine now, but if that changed, she said they would have to determine what entity would enforce the age restriction because Summit County Public Health would only have jurisdiction in Summit County. The law has been approved by Summit County Council, Akron, Kent, Twinsburg, Mogadore, Green, Richfield and Norton, but was rejected by Cuyahoga Falls, Hudson and Stow. County Council’s approval affects Bath, Boston, Copley, Coventry, Northfield Center, Richfield, Sagamore Hills, Springfield and Twinsburg townships.

# E-bikes of Southern New Mexico offers a more enjoyable, faster way to commute

Alexia Severson 
Las Cruces Bulletin Roberto Trigo, a Las Cruces dentist, finds joy in being able to pass by the long line of cars stuck at the stoplight on his bicycle – especially in construction-ridden areas. He also enjoys the ease of pedaling his bike, reaching a speed of 22 miles per hour, without breaking a sweat.  He can do this because he has an e-bike, a bicycle that can be run on electric power (allowing the rider varying levels of assistance), as well as by pedaling with no assistance.  “You have to try one to understand how it feels and how much more enjoyable getting around town can be because you have the assistance of the electric motor,” Trigo said. “It feels like you get a lot more use out of the bicycle – you’re more likely to get on it and go than a regular bike for everyday things.”  Trigo said he uses his e-bike to run errands and to commute to work daily, something he only did on occasion with a regular bicycle. He rides an EG Oahu electric cruiser bike, which he bought in November 2018 from E-Bikes of Southern New Mexico in Las Cruces, just one month after buying a smaller, foldable e-bike from the same business. He was hooked.  E-Bikes of Southern New Mexico is owned by Jim and Barbara Toth, who opened for business in January 2018. The couple sells a variety of e-bikes, geared toward all types of cyclists, out of their home garage. Customers can make an appointment to stop by and try out several models; all they have to do is sign a waiver and wear a helmet.  Jim Toth, an avid cyclist since 1974, said last year they sold 16 e-bikes, which he thinks is good start. The couple hopes to sell more this year.  “If our business takes off, we’d like to move to a brick and mortar store,” he said. “But at the same time, we’re fine with our garage.”  Toth said thus far, all their customers have been pleased with their e-bike purchases.  “Our youngest customer is 22 and our oldest customer is 81 years old,” Toth said. “We do keep in contact with our customers and haven’t found anyone who isn’t satisfied with their bike.”  Toth explained there are three classes of e-bikes:  • Class 1: A bicycle with a motor that provides assistance up to 20 miles per hour while you pedal. 
• Class 2: A bicycle with a motor that provides assistance up to 20 miles per hour while you pedal, but also has a throttle mode that can be used to propel the bicycle. 
• Class 3: A bicycle with a motor that provides assistance up to 28 miles per hour while you pedal.  “Those three classes are the only ones legal in the U.S.,” Toth said. “The way Las Cruces and the state of New Mexico handles things is it’s treated just like a bicycle, so you can ride it anywhere you would a regular bicycle.”  In addition to the different classes, customers can choose among different models, with the motor attached to the front wheel hub, in the middle, at the crank or on the rear wheel hub. 
The size of the motors and batteries attached to the bike also vary.  E-bikes sold by the Toths range from about $1,000 to $3,500. Sales are also offered on occasion. The couple said some e-bikes sold in the U.S. can cost as much as $10,000, but that they try to keep prices as affordable as possible.  Along with making a daily commute easier, Barbara Toth said e-bikes are great equalizers.  “People who like to ride with people they think they can’t keep up with are able to join those rides with people they couldn’t initially and are able to ride faster and farther than they could,” she said.  Being able to manage the degree of assistance you get from an e-bike also makes them ideal for people who have health concerns, Barbara Toth said.  In addition to selling e-bikes, the Toths provide e-bike repairs and offer the service of turning a regular bike into an e-bike.

# Mystery unravelled: Stolen Hyderabad bus found in Maharashtra

HYDERABAD: The mystery of the stolen bus from Hyderabad was solved in the late hours of Thursday, after the missing Metro Express RTC bus was found 300 km away, in Nanded, Maharashtra. The six-year-old bus, which had served the city for 8 lakh kilometers worth of travel time, was stripped to it’s tyres and the chassis. It was last seen at the CBS bus station was found amidst a lot of rubble along with the name board of the bus, ‘3D from Afzalgunj to Ambedkar Nagar’ found lying around.  In pictures circulating online,it was show that the blue seats of the bus were dismantled, removed and kept aside. The leftover scrap,was then dismantled by the crooks and sold off for a sum of Rs 50,000, reportedly.  Previously, the police officials had noted that the bus bearing the registration number - AP11Z6254- was found near Toopran, 55 km from Hyderabad at 1 am on Wednesday early morning. It scaled the rest of 300 odd kilometers in next 4 hours and landed in Nanded, possibly in the early hours. It eventually took the crooks little time to dismantle the bus and sell off its parts. It may be mentioned that a bus usually lives out 1-15 years before dismantled by TSRTC only after it is certified unfit for the road.  The possible route it took was via Kamaraeddy, Nizamabad, Bodhan. Police officials however noted that until all investigations are over, information can’t be divulged.<end_of_turn>

# Opinion | I Can’t Jump Ship From Facebook Yet

In 2009, a study found that the mothers of children with autism experienced a level of chronic stress similar to that of combat soldiers. Two and a half years after I read about that study, I was told that my son had autism. He was about to turn 2. A few months after his diagnosis, he started doing something I didn’t understand. He was looking out of the corner of his eyes and flapping his hands in front of them. It was self-stimulatory behavior, or stimming, common in kids on the autism spectrum, and he did it intensely. Putting him in his crib at nap time during this stage was hard. I would stay by his side and sing to him, often for 30 minutes or more, because it was the only way to distract him from flapping and get him to fall asleep. One day, my energy was flagging. Instead of sticking around to sing at nap time I quietly left the room. Maybe he would flap himself to sleep? It seemed worth trying. I went back to check on him 10 minutes later and there he was, awake and waving his hand. And I thought, there is no one on earth who knows how I feel, exhausted and scared, watching my child flap and flap in the dark. But I was wrong. There are people like me around, stumbling through caring for a child who isn’t “neurotypical,” and it’s comforting to know they exist. They helped me learn to accept him, stimming included. Other parents’ frustrations, questions, honest and sometimes funny tales — all provide a balm on hard days. It hasn’t been that fashionable to be into Facebook lately, and with good reason. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder and chief executive, was called before Congress last week to discuss troubling reports about its data gathering and advertising practices. Yet I am still on it. It has become a convenient tool to stave off a bit of the isolation that can come with the special-needs parent territory. For me, user-created Facebook groups for special-needs parents function like a very convenient support group you can check in with as your time-crunched life permits. People share recommendations and advice. They vent about schools, health insurance and daily life. I am not even that active in these groups, but it’s reassuring to hear from other parents, even just online. I asked some parents in a couple of my Facebook groups for their thoughts about what the social network means to them, particularly with the latest news and the calls to delete it. Here’s some of what I heard: “This group makes me feel less alone.” “I felt rescued by a connection made here.” “I did delete Facebook and found myself sort of unraveling. I feel so alone without it. I’m actually tearing up as I type this.” Autism is often misunderstood (and it doesn’t help that a weird puzzle piece has been used to symbolize it). But its prevalence means that most people have heard of it. Facebook might be even more valuable for individuals with very rare conditions and their families. Emily Wilkinson told me about her 5-year-old daughter, who was the first person given a diagnosis of Xia-Gibbs syndrome, caused by a genetic mutation, when she was 20 months old. Since then, about 70 people, mostly children, have been found to have the condition worldwide, and it is thought to lead to both physical and intellectual disabilities. Ms. Wilkinson says the Facebook group that parents and caregivers formed has been life-changing. Members are far-flung, and some of the parents have met in person. There were times when Ms. Wilkinson wanted to delete Facebook, or take a break, but she couldn’t go through with it partly because of the group. Rivka Einy-Biton has a 3-month-old son who was recently found to have megalencephaly-capillary malformation syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by tissue overgrowth that affects brain development. There are under 300 reported cases of the condition. Joining a private Facebook group for those affected by the syndrome has helped her gain clarity and strength. Her fellow members share advice, resources and pictures of their own children. “In certain ways,” she noted, “this group has been more helpful than many of the specialists we have seen.” Another parent, Juliet Ross, has a 7-year-old son with eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic digestive disorder that requires him to use a feeding tube. She said the members of the Facebook group devoted to the condition refer to each other as “our EoE family.” Halloween is difficult for the children because restricted diets leave most, if not all, candy off limits, so the families join forces and mail each other cards instead. It’s useful, too, that they know the details about providing this specific type of medical care at home. “When I have a feeding tube question in the middle of the night, it’s really helpful that there might be another mom awake, maybe in Australia, who knows the answer,” she noted. The kids themselves can get lonely as the only person in their circle with a feeding tube. It has become common for parents to reach out on Facebook, asking for pictures, so that their children can see that they are not alone. Of course, it’s not just special-needs parents who find support on Facebook. There are lots of other important groups connecting there, including adults with disabilities. What should we all do? It’s not that I care about my personal privacy. I’m boring. It is about what Facebook is allowing to happen with the data it has on millions of boring people like me. There is evidence that it allowed advertisers to discriminate by targeting housing and employment ads to white users only. Then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which raised concerns that data and “dark ads” were used to manipulate voters. In Myanmar, Facebook has been accused of facilitating violence against Rohingya Muslims by permitting anti-Muslim hate speech to spread on its platform. These stories should start pricking the conscience of us all. I hope Facebook and lawmakers can change this trajectory — move fast and fix things! — and win back people’s trust. But if things don’t get fixed, there is something every boring person still on Facebook should start thinking about doing, in particular those who have formed vital support groups. Recognize the powerful thing you have created. Start figuring out the best replacement where your group can congregate — a lifeboat, if you will. Once that lifeboat is in place, take a stand, band together and jump ship. It’s not that we need Facebook. We just need one another.<end_of_turn>

# San Diego synagogue shooting: Suspect arrested after one killed and three wounded

A 19-year-old man armed with an assault-style rifle opened fire inside a synagogue near San Diego on Saturday, killing one woman inside and wounding three others in a hate crime on the last day of Passover.  The 19-year-old man, whose name was not released, fled in a car and called 911 shortly afterward to say he was involved in the shooting at Chabad of Poway, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said.  When an officer reached the man on a roadway, "the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody," Mr Nisleit said.  The officer found an AR-type rifle in the front passenger seat.  Poway Mayor Steve Vaus characterised the shooting as a "hate crime," saying his assessment was based on statements uttered by the gunman when he entered the synagogue.  At the White House, US President Donald Trump said: "My deepest sympathies go to the people that were affected." He added that "it looks like a hate crime" and that authorities will "get to the bottom of it."  Authorities say they were reviewing copies of his social media posts.  San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said four people were struck by gunfire and taken to Palomar Medical Centre, where one of the victims, an "older woman," died. The three other patients - "two adult males" and a "female juvenile" - were listed in stable condition, Mr Gore said.  There was no known threat after the man was detained, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship as a precaution, Mr Nisleit said.  The shooting came exactly six months since a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue killed 11 people in the deadliest attack on Jews in US history.  An off-duty Border Patrol agent inside the synagogue in the city of Poway, just over 20 miles north of San Diego, opened fire as the shooter fled but didn't hit him, Mr Gore said.  Minoo Anvari told CNN that she's a member of Chabad of Poway and her husband was inside during the shooting. She said he called to tell her the shooter was shouting and cursing and she called the shooting "unbelievable" in a peaceful and tight-knit community.  "We are strong, we are united, they can't break us," she said.  Christopher Folts, a nearby resident, said on CNN he heard six to seven gunshots, then a man yelling, followed by six to seven more shots.  Cantor Caitlin Bromberg of Ner Tamid Synagogue, down the street from the shooting scene, said her congregation learned of the shooting at the end of their Passover services and that they were heading to Chabad of Poway to show support and help.  "We are horrified and upset, and we want them to know we are thinking of them," Ms Bromberg told The Los Angeles Times, adding that she has not heard from Chabad of Poway leadership because they would not normally use the phone during the Sabbath.  "They would only do that on emergency basis, if they do it at all," Ms Bromberg told the newspaper.  Passover began on April 19 and was ending on Saturday.  In Pittsburgh, a truck driver who authorities say expressed hatred of Jews has been charged in the October 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue. He's pleaded not guilty.  Saturday's Passover violence followed a recent spate of deadly attacks on houses of worship around the world. Suicide bombings during Easter Sunday services at several churches in Sri Lanka killed more than 250 people. Weeks earlier a gunman who opened fire at two mosques in New Zealand left 49 people dead and more than 40 wounded, some as they knelt in prayer.<end_of_turn>

# 3 things to know about Titans defensive back Amani Hooker, including how Iowa practices shaped him

Here are three things to know about the defensive back out of Iowa: He’s pumped to work with Kerry Coombs When the Titans hosted Hooker for a pre-draft visit, the team’s secondary coach made an impression on him immediately – as he does with everyone he meets. "Fire, energy guy," Hooker said of Titans secondary coach Kerry Coombs. "Loves the game of football. Loves to learn the game of football. And he expects the same out of me, to have that same energy. He’s not going to need to motivate me. I’m going to come in motivated and ready to make plays and ready to impact the team and help the team win games." And as for the prospect of playing alongside guys in the Titans’ secondary such as Kevin Byard? "Kevin Byard’s a dog," Hooker said. "I mean, two years ago, he led the league in interceptions. Every time I turned on ESPN, there he is making a play. They have a great defense over there. They run a similar defense that we ran at Iowa, so it shouldn’t be too tough of a transition for me to understand what’s going on. And obviously it’s exciting to be back there in the secondary."  He faced top-tier tight ends at Iowa Every practice was another battle. In that way, Hooker leaves Iowa as something of a tight end-covering guru. Facing George Kittle, T.J. Hockenson and Noah Fant on a regular basis will have that effect. Hooker overlapped with Kittle at Iowa in 2016, before Kittle was drafted by the 49ers and became one of the top tight ends in the NFL. Hooker is in the same class as Hockenson and Fant, who both were drafted in the first round on Thursday. "So I think I’m really good at guarding (tight ends)," Hooker said. "They set the standard for tight ends, and every time I go against them in practices, it’s a battle, and hopefully I do the same for them. It definitely prepared me for going against tight ends as well."  Hybrid defensive back Hooker, who grew up modeling his game after Ed Reed and Jamal Adams, is described by NFL.com as a hybrid safety who "could thrive in a 'robber' role or as a big nickel where he can match up against pass-catching tight ends." Hooker said he divided his time about evenly playing safety and nickelback in college. "I’m not really particular or have a specific position," he said. "I feel like whatever the need is for the team and whatever way I can help the team out, I feel like Kerry Coombs is going to put me in the right position to make plays and help the team out, whether that’s back in safety or up in the nickel and the slot. Whatever he has planned for me, I’m ready to take on the opportunity." The positions have their own challenges, but Hooker said he's equipped to handle both. "Safety, that’s where you’re in the middle, get the picks, being able to read the quarterback's eyes and make plays from there," he said. "The nickel spot’s a little different; you’re more man-to-man, a little more zone concept to the curl, to the flat area, and you might be pressed man-to-man playing against the slot receiver who runs a 4.3. So it’s definitely challenges, but I’m ready to take those on." Reach Erik Bacharach at ebacharach@tennessean.com and on Twitter @ErikBacharach.<end_of_turn>

# Heavy rains lash Mozambique after Cyclone Kenneth; 4 dead | WTOP

PEMBA, Mozambique (AP) — Heavy rains lashed northern Mozambique on Saturday in the wake of Cyclone Kenneth as aid groups warned of possible flooding and mudslides in the days ahead.  At least four deaths had been reported. Mozambique’s disaster authorities said one person was killed in Pemba city and another in hard-hit Macomia district, while residents on Ibo island said two people died there. A large number of homes in parts of northernmost Cabo Delgado province were destroyed, with electricity cut and at least one key bridge collapsed.  Cyclone Kenneth arrived late Thursday, just six weeks after Cyclone Idai ripped into central Mozambique and killed more than 600 people. This was the first time in recorded history that the southern African nation has been hit by two cyclones in one season, again raising concerns about climate change . Kenneth, packing the power of a Category 4 hurricane, tore into a region that had never seen such a fierce storm during the age of satellite observation. Its remnants could dump twice as much rain as Idai did last month, the U.N. World Program has said.  Aid groups warned that flooding remained a danger after Kenneth, just as flooding caused most of the deaths after Idai. Some forecasts warned of as much as 250 millimeters (9 inches) of torrential rain, or about a quarter of the average annual rainfall for the region.  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies on Saturday reported heavy damage to Cabo Delgado province, with the communities of Macomia, Quissanga and Mocimboa da Praia of highest concern.  Communications remained challenging in some areas as authorities and aid groups scrambled to assess the damage, especially in more far-flung communities in the largely rural region. Mozambique’s disaster management agency has said nearly 700,000 people could be at risk, many left exposed and hungry as flood waters rise.  “The situation wasn’t worse thanks to awareness-raising work by local authorities,” the agency said on Saturday while posting photos of buildings where metal roofs had been crumpled or ripped away. Other photos from Macomia showed a mud-walled home that had disintegrated, a bus that appeared to have slid off the road and a toppled electrical pole, its wires straining.  ___  Follow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa  Copyright © 2019 The Associated Press.

# Charles Leclerc: Ferrari star CRASHES OUT of Azerbaijan Grand Prix qualifying

The starlet lost control of his car and made his first mistake of the 2019 season. He was in fifth place during the second session in qualifying when the incident happened and the session was stopped. It means Leclerc could start as low as 15th or as high as 10th depending on how other cars go in the remainder of the session. "I am stupid, I am stupid..." Leclerc said following the mistake. The 21-year-old has impressed so far this season but he was clearly distraught after the incident which means he faces a tough afternoon tomorrow. Sky Sports F1 reporter Ted Kravitz also revealed how Ferrari felt in the immediate aftermath of the crash. He explained: "Ferrari are shell-shocked. I don't think they can quite believe what has happened." The incident caused quite a delay to the qualifying session with the Ferrari needing to be lifted from the crash area and debri swept away. Paul Di Resta revealed he felt grip would be a problem for the remainder of the session and would cause Sebastian Vettel quite a problem compared to his rivals. "That is going to impact the grip there quite a lot," he said on the turn eight area following Leclerc's crash. "That won't clean up very quickly. It will take a good bit into Q3. That will hamper Vettel who will have to run again on the softs. "Red Bull and Mercedes will be quite happy because they have a lap time that is probably good enough to see them through already." Another F1 pundit Karun Chandhok believes Ferrari were to blame for the crash. "Yes Leclerc made a mistake, but I don't think Ferrari helped him by putting him on that tyre," he explained. The Azerbaijan Grand Prix gets underway at 1.10pm BST tomorrow.<end_of_turn>

# CFI to host event to honor child abuse survivors

MADISON — A local agency is holding an event at the Boone County Courthouse on April 30. According to Cornerstone Family Interventions, Inc., this is a time when disclosures of sexual abuse and harassment are becoming mainstream, child sexual abuse still lives in secrecy and shame. In Boone County alone, about 10 percent of over-18 population adult survivors live as testament both to the damage of child abuse—and as the substance of hope for children experiencing abuse today.  Members of the public are invited to attend an event on April 30 at the Boone County Courthouse at 12:30 p.m. for the annual Children’s Memorial Flag Day Ceremony that will be followed by something new. Through a new national campaign—the SHINE Campaign—the staff at Cornerstone and the Multi-Disciplinary Investigative Team, are changing the conversation around child sexual abuse and raising up stories of hope, offering survivors and advocates the chance to pledge their support to other survivors and victims of child abuse, and connect the public with resources. Through this campaign, they are encouraging everyday people to SHINE in support of survivors—to be the light that survivors can turn to—making it easier to become an advocate, and helping kids shine again. The Children’s Advocacy Center (CAC) movement in our state is at the heart of the effort to bring hope to survivors. Our CACs served 4,106 children last year and provided 1230 people with the healing mental health services that help children and families recover from trauma. Also, Organization/CACs in West Virginia provide abuse prevention education to 18,276 children and 6650 adults each year.  "April is a time to celebrate the important role that communities play in protecting children and strengthening families," said Monica Ballard-Booth, Executive Director, Cornerstone Family Interventions, Inc. "Everyone's participation is critical. Focusing on ways to connect with families is the best thing our community can do to strengthen families and prevent child abuse and neglect." In support of these efforts, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau, Office on Child Abuse and Neglect, its Child Welfare Information Gateway, the FRIENDS National Center for Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention and over 30 national prevention partners have created 2019 Prevention Resource Guide: Strong and Thriving Families. The resource guide, designed for service providers who work throughout the community to support families, is available online at childwelfare.com/topics/preventing/preventionmonth/resources/resource-guide/. For more information about child abuse prevention programs and activities during the month of April, and throughout the year, contact Cornerstone Family Interventions, Inc. at (304) 369-5283 or visit facebook.com/CFIINC.<end_of_turn>

# Crikey Worm: Announcements abound ahead of leaders' debate

PROMISES, PROMISES  Ahead of early polling this morning, The Courier-Mail ($) reports that Bill Shorten has followed up $6 billion-worth of announcements for subsidised childcare and senior dental care with plans to extend a $75 million mapping program for Queensland commodities. And with the first leaders’ debate in Perth tonight, Shorten has coincidentally topped up $2 million in funding for the annual Channel Seven Perth Telethon.  For the Prime Minister’s part, The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Scott Morrison will announce $156 million for cyber security recruitment. This is in addition to yesterday’s announcements of a three-year cap on Australia’s refugee intake and a promise of $260 million to remove a rail crossing in Josh Frydenberg’s Melbourne seat of Kooyong.  POLL DANCE  United Australia Party preferences have pushed the Coalition’s TPP vote a point to trail Labor just 49-51 in the latest Newspoll ($), with Clive Palmer’s mass advertisements apparently grabbing 5% of the primary vote at the expense of both the ALP (37, from 39) and Coalition (38, from 39). However, as the Poll Bludger William Bowe argues, the new two-party-preferred result could could come down to how UAP preferences have been distributed assuming a 60-40 split.  EXHAUSTION KILLS 270+ ELECTION WORKERS IN INDONESIA  In Indonesia more than 270 election staff have reportedly died due to fatigue-related illnesses 10 days after counting millions of ballot papers by hand during for the world’s largest single-day election.  The Sydney Morning Herald reports that, while the elections that returned President Joko Widodo to power were mostly peaceful, the April 17 elections were the first time the country of 260 million people combined the presidential vote with national and regional parliamentary ones as a cost-saving policy.  THEY REALLY SAID THAT?   He’s no monster.  Kirilly Dutton The childcare centre owner and wife of Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton insists he’s a great dad ($).  CRIKEY QUICKIE: THE BEST OF YESTERDAY  “What a fickle master politics can be. Until recently, One Nation was the star attraction of politics’ idiot fringe, the group set to disrupt the plans of the major parties in Queensland. Now, based on one poll, Clive Palmer’s ad spending and his relentless self-promotion, it’s his United Australia Party, or whatever it is called this week, that has been deemed the new disruptor set to dictate terms to the major parties and even secure the balance of power.”  “When Australians talk about having the oldest surviving culture on Earth, Susan Moylan-Coombs wants you to really think about what that means. Indigenous Australians prospered on this continent for what we now estimate to be roughly 80,000 years before the colonial project arrived and, in her words, ‘took just over 230 years to fuck it up’.”  “War is human history’s hardest labour and to every worker ever drawn or forced to do it, my sincere and sober respects. I offer these because, goodness me, Anzac Day just keeps on ballsing up its one job of the year. The day is set aside not to honour brutal human sacrifice, even if it says so on the box. It is, I suggest, both the tool and the effect of control. Of course, that’s not news — even if reported that way anew each year.”  READ ALL ABOUT IT  THE COMMENTARIAT  Treasury signs off on budget fantasy forecasts — Ross Gittins (The Sydney Morning Herald): “While we were preparing for the Easter-Anzac super long weekend, the secretary to the Treasury and the secretary of the Finance Department released the PEFO – pre-election economic and fiscal outlook – their official, once-every-three-years licence to tell us anything the government hasn’t told us but should have. And what was that? Not a sausage.”  Preference deal with UAP looks likely to pay off for Coalition ($) — David Briggs (The Australian): “With one in four voters now ­selecting a minor party or independent, the task of allocating preferences becomes increasingly difficult when we calculate the two-party-preferred vote from our estimates of the primary support for the parties.”  Medivac missteps rack sick refugees — Behrouz Boochani (The Saturday Paper): “According to this law, all sick refugees on Manus and Nauru now have the opportunity to be transferred to Australia for medical assistance. Although there was opposition, in the end it was a success for those refugees. In fact, this was the first time in six years that the Australian parliament passed a law that could be considered somewhat humane.”  HOLD THE FRONT PAGE  WHAT’S ON TODAY  Perth

Baltimore Center Stage Artistic Director Stephanie Ybarra Appoints Two to Senior Artistic Staff by BWW News Desk Baltimore Center Stage is excited to announce two additions to its leadership team and artistic staff. Chiara Klein has been appointed Director of Artistic Producing and will join Center Stage from New York's Public Theater. Adena Varner has been promoted to Director of Learning and Social Accountability.  In her role as the Director of Artistic Producing, Klein will oversee the facilitation of artistic processes connected to all Baltimore Center Stage productions. She will work closely with Artistic Director Stephanie Ybarra throughout the season to ensure the alignment of values and resources within Center Stage producing structures. Klein joins Baltimore Center Stage following a stellar run at The Public Theater where she led the Mobile Unit program's national expansion. The initiative included a five-state tour of Lynne Nottage's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, SWEAT, as well as customized artistic activities designed to center conversations most alive in each community.  Complementing Klein's appointment, Baltimore Center Stage has promoted Baltimore native Adena Varner to Director of Learning and Social Accountability. In addition to overseeing all education, family and civic programming, Varner will drive the organization's social accountability practices, through which Center Stage will build on its commitment to respectfully and responsibly facilitate storytelling of, by and for all communities. Varner's previous role at the theater was Education Director, where she spearheaded the expansion of the student camp program, Teaching Artist residences and the Young Playwrights Festival.  "Adena and Chiara each bring their own unique vision for the American Theater and for Baltimore Center Stage," said Baltimore Center Stage Artistic Director, Stephanie Ybarra. "Within minutes of arriving in Baltimore, it was clear to me Adena Varner would be key to the future success of this organization - she wears her love of this city readily on her sleeve. Chiara Klein is a tremendous addition to the Baltimore community, having witnessed firsthand her ability to facilitate an artistic process with integrity, rigor and an over-abundance of laughter, I think she's going to fit in juuuuust fine. I feel like the luckiest artistic leader in the land to have these women working alongside me. Individually, they are formidable in their talent, intellect and creativity, but together they are utterly unstoppable."  CHIARA KLEIN is an artistic producer, most recently at The Public Theater where she led the creation of the first national Mobile Unit initiative which launched in the fall of 2018 with a five-state tour of SWEAT by Lynn Nottage. In partnership with local leaders, Mobile Unit National included both a tour of a play and a customized program of artistic activities designed to center issues and conversations most alive in each community. A native New Yorker, Chiara began her professional theatrical career at the age of 14 by producing/directing/designing/conducting musicals at her synagogue. After earning a BA in Theater and Psychology from Dartmouth College, she founded MaineStage Shakespeare, an outdoor repertory company and youth theater camp in Southern Maine, which she ran for seven years as Artistic Director. Her other professional experiences include roles at Yale Repertory Theatre, Berkeley Repertory Theatre, Marvell Rep, and the New York Musical Festival. She is the producer and emcee of the annual Ms. New York Senior America Pageant for women over 60. Chiara holds an MFA from Yale School of Drama and an MBA from Yale School of Management where she was the recipient of the George C. White Prize.

# CAPITOL STEPS Returns To Poway

CAPITOL STEPS Returns To Poway by BWW News Desk The Poway Center for the Performing Arts welcomes the reliably irreverent Capitol Steps, Washington DC's political satirists extraordinaire, for an 8 p.m. performance on Friday, May 3, 2019. This perennial favorite promises to tackle both sides of the political spectrum and all things equally foolish. What more would you expect from the troupe that puts the "MOCK" in Democracy? 
 
Capitol Steps is a lively political comedy show blending song and standup. It lampoons today's political leaders with equal fervor. Capitol Steps does not shy away from the major issues of the day. In fact, it's been called A machine gun of comedy, firing one joke after another it demands that you keep up! 
 
Reflecting the intensity of the post- 2016 political climate and mid-term elections, Capitol Steps runs headfirst into controversy, political incorrectness on both sides, bombast and hearty ridicule. From Kavanugh to North Korea, few are spared. The New York Times calls Capitol Steps Irrepressible satirists . . .they puncture the powerful with their latest scattershot onslaught of comedy. D.C. Theatre Scene asked, Who's funnier Democrats of Republicans? 
 
Capitol Steps began in 1981 as a group of Senate staffers who set out to satirize the very people and places that employed them. Staffers for Senator Charles Percy were planning entertainment for a Christmas party. Their first idea was to stage a nativity play, but in the whole Congress they couldn't find three wise men or a virgin. So, they decided to dig into the headlines of the day, and created song parodies with skits conveying a special brand of satirical humor. Although not all of the current members of the Steps are former Capitol Hill staffers, taken together the performers have worked in a total of eighteen Congressional offices and represent 62 years of collective House and Senate staff experience. 
 
Since they began, the Capitol Steps have recorded more than 30 albums, including What to Expect When You're Electing, and their latest, Make American Grin Again. They've been featured on NBC, CBS, ABC, and PBS, and can be heard twice a year on National Public Radio stations nationwide during their Politics Takes a Holiday radio specials. 
 
Their show is constantly changing in order to reflect the current political climate. It is strenuously bi-partisan, and includes songs about the mid-term election madness, as well as other things in the news, such as Happy Days are Here for Dems, Are You Suffering from Electile Dysfunction? (regarding claims of voter fraud), Hang Down Your Head , Paul Ryan, and Calendar Girl, sung as Brett Kavanugh's best defense.

# Seattle judge spat taints reform effort

The Puget Sound region is counting on Seattle to fix its criminal-justice problems.  So it’s deeply disappointing that the repair process is starting with City Attorney Pete Holmes publicly attacking a judge seeking reforms.  Presiding Municipal Court Judge Ed McKenna perhaps strayed into a gray area by raising concerns about repeat offenders cycling through courts with little consequence. His perspective added credibility to reports — including our recent editorials — on failures of Seattle’s justice system to protect residents and businesses from rising crime in some neighborhoods.  But that did not warrant a public attack by Holmes and Department of Public Defense Director Anita Khandelwal, alleging that McKenna was tainting the court and should step down as presiding judge. In an April 24 letter provided to the press even before McKenna saw it, they demanded he change his behavior and said their departments won’t participate in bench-bar meetings until he gives up his leadership position.  This was a political hit. Coming after McKenna publicly voiced concerns about justice-system failures, it looks like retribution for McKenna threatening the status quo. It also sent a message to other judges that they best not speak out of turn.  One question is whether McKenna was seeking “harsh” sentences, or inquiring about a general dearth of jail sentences sought for crimes committed. A recent study of prolific offenders found Holmes’ office often agrees to little or no post-conviction jail time for repeat offenders, even if they violated terms of a prior release. Perhaps McKenna was asking prosecutors if they had forgotten something.  This spat bodes poorly for the task force Mayor Jenny Durkan formed to address concerns about prolific offenders repeatedly victimizing residents and businesses in some neighborhoods.  Will any member dare question the orthodoxy, which basically calls for diverting all but heinous offenders away from jail and into Seattle’s tangle of private, publicly funded social-service organizations? Of course, jails won’t fix the broader homeless and addiction crises, and courts play an important role connecting people to treatment. These social problems need more attention but don’t excuse serious, persistent criminal behavior by offenders competent to stand trial.  Will any other elected official dare speak the forbidden words that McKenna uttered, acknowledging that Seattle’s leniency and generous social services are attracting criminals from around the state and nation? He forgot the script saying it’s the fault of Jeff Bezos and evil homeowners who should make way for more apartments.  Between the time Durkan formed the task force and its first meeting last week, it was branded in a way that appears to soften focus on prolific offenders and increase emphasis on social problems. It’s now the “High Barrier Individuals in our Social Services & Criminal Justice System Policy and Planning Working Group.”  Durkan also created a parallel working group of elected officials including Holmes and McKenna. Both want to improve the system but can they cooperate after Holmes and Khandelwal blindsided the judge?  Especially noxious were insinuations that McKenna was wrong to invite a resident advocating for public safety and a journalist to observe sentencing. Holmes and Khandelwal had this wrong — the journalist issued a statement saying he came of his own accord. Either way, judges should invite journalists and citizens into their courtrooms. If the media and public were more aware of what happens in municipal court, there would be more accountability for all involved.  Public confidence in Seattle’s criminal-justice system is at low point and not because McKenna is discussing problems from his vantage point, presiding over the state’s busiest courtrooms.  The Washington code of ethics for judges calls for them to act in ways that build confidence in the independence, integrity and impartiality of courts. All are equally important, according to Appeals Court Judge Linda Lee, chair of the state judicial ethics advisory committee.  To act with integrity, should a judge speak out about system failures affecting community safety, even if it risks raising concerns about impartiality? More details are needed about specific cases to know whether harm was caused.  But in going out on this limb, McKenna is building confidence that his court is independent from the City Hall political machine that’s failing too often to provide safety and civility.<end_of_turn>

# Scott Disick Reveals How He Keeps Sofia Richie’s Trust While Staying Close With Kourtney

Seeing how close Scott Disick is to his ex, Kourtney Kardashian, can’t be easy for Sofia Richie, and on the April 28 episode of ‘KUWTK,’ Scott dished on how he manages BOTH relationships at the same time.   Scott Disick joined the Kardashians on a family vacation to Bali during the April 28 episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, which meant he spent a lot of quality time with ex, Kourtney Kardashian, while his girlfriend, Sofia Richie, was thousands of miles away. During the trip, Scott and Kourtney even found out they were ‘soulmates’ who knew each other in another life! “If I was Sofia, I would be so insecure,” Khloe Kardashian told Scott. “I don’t care how confident you are. It’s weird if you’re Sofia.” However, Scott revealed that his 20-year-old girlfriend actually had a much different attitude about how close he is with Kourtney.   “Sofia knew going into this that I was extremely close with Kourtney,” he explained. “She was like — Listen, I will never get in between you and your family and your children. Just speak to me and make me comfortable.” Khloe and Scott both admitted that they didn’t know if they could be so mature if the roles were reversed, and Scott made it clear that he wasn’t going to end things with Sofia just because he learned he and Kourt were soulmates. “I thought for a very long time that I was going to live a very miserable life,” he said. “I didn’t think I was going to have happiness again. I definitely don’t want to disrespect my relationship with Sofia, because it means a lot to me.”  However, at the end of the day, he also vowed to ALWAYS be there for Kourtney and their three kids, Mason, Penelope and Reign. “Whether Kourtney and I are soulmates or not, I feel like I owe a lot to Kourtney for the times I missed when I wasn’t the best partner to her,” Scott admitted.”So I feel like I will forever be making up for that lost time for the rest of her life. At the end of the day, I don’t want to hurt anybody. Sofia knows we’re raising three kids together and until our kids are 100, I’ll still be making sure that Kourtney and our kids are a priority in my life.”  By the end of the episode, Kourtney and Scott came to the agreement that they are ‘soulmates,’ just not in the general sense most people think of the word. “I don’t know what the definition of soulmate is, but Scott and I, we’re going to be in each other’s lives forever,” Kourtney explained.”We are soulmates, in a sense. No matter what, we’re forever, together or not.”  Scott and Sofia first got together at the end of summer 2017, when things were not in a great place between Scott and Kourtney. The new relationship led to some tension between the trio after Scott introduced Sofia to the kids without telling Kourtney first. However, as the months passed, things got much better, which is why Kourtney agreed to let Scott go on the Bali trip in Oct. 2018. By December 2018, Sofia was joining in on other family trips and events, as well. She even attended Kourtney’s 40th birthday party earlier this month!<end_of_turn>

# Google Play Store purges popular Chinese developer's apps on account of ad-fraud- Technology News, Firstpost

tech2 News StaffApr 29, 2019 13:49:39 IST Ad-fraud is a big problem that Google has to constantly deal with on the Play Store. Developers often have a tendency to design apps which contain code for users to fraudulently click on ads which can drain the battery and also use unnecessary mobile data. Chinese firm DO Global, which makes Android apps, has been deemed by Google as a creator of fraudulent ads on its apps and the Mountain View-based giant has purged most of DO Global's apps.  As per a report by Buzzfeed, DO Global, which is partially backed by Chinese search engine giant Baidu, has had up to 46 apps removed from Play Store and many more could bite the dust.  “We actively investigate malicious behaviour, and when we find violations, we take action, including the removal of a developer’s ability to monetise their app with AdMob or publish on Play,” a Google spokesperson told Buzzfeed.  DO Global's apps have about 600 million installs worldwide and have 250 million active users on its apps. As per the report, apps such as Selfie Camera and Total Cleaner apps contained "code that could enable app attribution ad fraud". This would enable the app to gain false rewards points for enabling the downloads of other apps.

# Van carrying Alanyaspor footballers overturns, killing forward Sural, injuring 6 others

A private van carrying seven players of the Aytemiz Alanyaspor football team overturned early Monday, killing Czech forward Josef Sural and injuring six other players.  The private luxury van hired by players departed from the central province of Kayseri after Sunday's Turkish Süper Lig match against Kayserispor and went off the road near the Alanya district of southern Antalya province, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) outside of the city center.  "According to the info I received from the police chief, there were two drivers and both fell asleep," Alanyaspor's chairman Hasan Çavuşoğlu said. Police detained the driver at the wheel after both were questioned.

The injured players were rushed to a nearby hospital with Sural in critical condition. Doctors operated on Sural but he later succumbed to his injuries at the hospital. Ismail Yetkin, the team doctor for Alanyaspor, told reporters that Sural, 28, died due to hemorrhage and hypothermic shock.  Among the football players in the van were Steven Caulker, Djalma Campos, Wanderson Baiano, Papiss Demba Cisse, Isaac Sackey, Welinton Souza and Sural. Yetkin said they are in stable condition and survived the accident with minor injuries. Çavuşoğlu said that the squad and technical team were given two days off as next week's match was scheduled for Monday, and foreign players decided to hire the van.  Born on May 30, 1990, in Czechia's Hustopece, Sural launched his football career in Zbrojovka Brno, where his 22-year-old brother Jakub Sural is currently playing. He then played for two important Czech clubs, ​Slovan Liberec (2011-2016) and Sparta Prague (2016-2019), before joining Alanyaspor in January on a 2.5-year contract. The forward made his debut for the Czech national team in 2013. 
 
He was married and the father of two daughters, including 2.5-month old Melissa. Turkish Football Federation (TFF) released a message on Sural's death, offering condolences to his family, the Alanyaspor community and to all of his fans. It was also announced that one minute of silence will be observed in memory of Sural before all professional matches scheduled between April 29 and May 6.  The Football Federation of the Czech Republic also issued a message commemorating Sural. "I knew Pepa from his time in Liberec. He was a modest and honest boy, with only the nicest memories left," said the national coach Jaroslav Silhavy, expressing his condolences to the Sural family. "We are deeply saddened by the tragic news of the death of our friend and former captain Josef Šural. We would like to express our condolences to his family. Šury, we will never forget you. Rest in peace!" Sparta Prague, where Sural scored 20 goals in 67 matches, wrote in a Twitter post.  Slovan Liberec, where Sural played in 113 matches and scored 30 goals, said in a Twitter post that a minute of silence will be observed before Saturday's match against Slavia Praha.<end_of_turn>

# Joe Biden opens 2020 campaign on home turf: a Pennsylvania union hall

Former Vice President Joe Biden, jumping into the 2020 presidential race as the apparent front-runner, plans to flash his political calling card Monday, holding his first campaign rally at a Pennsylvania union hall — a venue that underscores his claim to be the candidate in the vast Democratic field best equipped to win support from blue-collar workers in industrial-heartland states that gave Donald Trump his margins of victory in 2016.  His rally at a Teamsters hall is his fourth union-themed event in two months, as he has called on loyal labor leaders to vouch for his credentials as a friend of middle- and working-class Americans.  “Who has had a 40-year career supporting workers, working families, unions and union rights every single step of the way?” Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Assn. of Fire Fighters, said in an interview after his union endorsed Biden on Monday morning. “That record is pretty straightforward and hard to call into question.”  The Scranton-born Biden is leaning hard into his Pennsylvania roots. Trump won the state in an upset by just 44,292 votes in 2016 and has hoped to win favor with the state’s beleaguered steel industry by slapping tariffs on imports. Biden argues to Democrats that he provides their strongest shot here and in two other crucial industrial states — Wisconsin and Michigan.  Trump tried to discredit Biden’s Monday event in advance, with a tweet about the strength of the Pennsylvania economy including “a now thriving Steel Industry (that was dead).”  A new national poll by Monmouth University suggests limits to how much the economy helps Trump. Only 12% of Americans in the poll said their family had benefited a great deal from recent growth in the economy; 41% say they have received some economic benefit. But 54% said they had not benefited much or all from the economy’s growth.  Trump also raised a central question of whether Biden’s strong support among union leaders will translate into broad backing from rank-and-file workers.  “The Dues Sucking firefighters leadership will always support Democrats, even though the membership wants me,” Trump tweeted.  Jon Vesco, a member of the steel workers union who attended Biden’s event, said he worries about support for Trump among his co-workers.  “A lot of people I work with are Trump supporters,” Vesco said. “They are tired of the same old, same old when it comes to Democrats. They need to get back to focusing on people and jobs, not bashing Trump,” he said.  The potential for a split between labor leaders and union members is part of the reason why many unions are being very cautious about endorsing any candidate early in 2020: Many leaders rushed to endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016, in some cases despite splits among their members. Clinton ultimately defeated Trump among voters in union households, but by a margin that was just half of what President Obama racked up in his 2012 reelection, according to exit polls.  Biden hopes a campaign message aimed at working Americans will woo back some of the union workers who moved to Trump last time.  “This isn’t about a demographic,” John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who is advising Biden, said in an interview. “It is about a bigger vision: Everyone needs economic opportunity. Everyone needs the opportunity to succeed and get the benefits of hard work.”  The campaign hopes that broad theme will reach beyond organized labor and the party’s ideological factions, he said.  Critics on the left have questioned Biden’s ties with corporate interests that have sometimes been at odds with workers’ interests. He took flak for holding his first high-dollar fundraiser at the home of a Comcast executive in Philadelphia last week. Progressives, including 2020 rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have criticized his support, as a U.S. senator from Delaware, for legislation backed by home-state banking interests.  “Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies,” Warren said during a campaign swing through Iowa last week when a reporter asked about the 2005 bankruptcy bill she opposed as a Harvard law professor because she believed it was too hard on financially strapped families. “Our disagreement is a matter of public record.”  Schaitberger said he worried that if Democrats go with a candidate like Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, they will move too far to the left to win back union members who voted for Trump. He cited Warren’s support for broad student loan debt cancellation and Sanders saying he supported restoration of voting rights to felons in prison.  “I recognize some of the energy of the party, but I’m very concerned about the party lurching too far to the left; I’m worried about candidates who have high-minded aspirational ideals,” said Schaitberger. “That’s not a recipe to win.”  Biden has built strong bonds with union leaders during his 36 years in the Senate and eight years as Obama’s vice president. Underscoring those ties, he paved the path to his campaign announcement with speeches at conferences of the firefighters union in March and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in early April, and with an appearance before striking workers of the United Food and Commercial Workers in mid-April.  Those proved to be especially welcoming venues for him. The firefighters waved “Run Joe Run” placards printed for the occasion. The electrical workers, a mostly white male audience, applauded when Biden seemed to make light of recent complaints that he had made some women uncomfortable with his practice of hugging and kissing people he meets in public.  But the labor movement is no monolith, and Biden will also have to court other workers and unions that are more left-leaning and more racially diverse. Sanders in 2016 enjoyed the backing of the Communications Workers of America, the National Nurses United and the American Postal Workers Union.<end_of_turn>

# Juvenile arrests rising in Newton

Editor's note: This article is the first in a two-part series focusing on juvenile crime in Harvey County.  According to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, 28 juveniles were arrested in McPherson County in 2017. During that same year, 211 juveniles were arrested in Harvey County. Of those 211 arrests, the KBI reports 182 were made by the Newton Police Department. The Newton Police Department's annual report for 2017 states 341 juveniles were arrested during that year. The discrepancy in numbers stems from what is classified as an arrest by each agency. The KBI counts only the "more heinous offense" in the case of an individual being arrested on multiple charges, and runaways are not included in the total. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Harvey County had an estimated population of 34,500 in 2017 (24.5 percent under 18), while McPherson County had around 28,700 people (23.3 percent under 18). So, while there were more youth living in Harvey County, there does not seem to be enough of them to warrant the huge gap in juvenile arrest totals. The number of juvenile arrests has fluctuated over the past decade — the Newton Police Department recorded 363 arrests in 2009, a number that steadily dropped until hitting a low of 169 in 2013, when the number started trending upward again. In 2017, 15 percent of arrests were juveniles. "We do have a lot of cases that involve juveniles," said Newton Police Chief Eric Murphy. The 341 juvenile arrests in 2017 jumped from 2016's total of 249, a spike that Murphy said stemmed from the reopening of EmberHope's shelter for youth, some of whom run away from the facility. Throughout the past decade, Newton's police officers have made the majority of juvenile arrests — not surprising, perhaps, given that the majority of the county's population lives inside city limits. What may be surprising is how many more juveniles are arrested — 12 times more than in neighboring McPherson County, according to the KBI statistics. McPherson Police Chief Robert McClarty said the department recorded 26 youth being detained and transported for 2017 — a number that does not include officers issuing citations or a notice to appear to juveniles for misdemeanors or status offenses. Adding in those incidents, the number of juveniles having contact with police officers would reach several hundred, according to McClarty. The McPherson PD did not have a total number to compare with Newton, and requests for information from the McPherson County Attorney's Office went unanswered. McClarty pointed out while Newton and McPherson are in the same judicial district, there are differences between the cities. "Newton is a totally different animal than McPherson," McClarty said. "There's no comparison. They are totally different cultures." The number of juvenile arrests in Newton take up a significant portion of the police department's resources, as well as costing taxpayers money. Harvey County spent $72,900 on juvenile detention in 2017. Most juveniles are transported to the Reno County Juvenile Detention Center. "They charge a daily rate that's not cheap," said Harvey County Attorney David Yoder. "...The county has to pay that price." The charge for each juvenile is $150 per day. The Harvey County Attorney's Office can go after the parents for remuneration of those costs, according to Yoder. "If the kid's been running around every night of the week and the parents don't know where they are and don't care, we have no problem going after the billing costs because the parents aren't taking responsibility," Yoder said. Getting repaid for juvenile detention costs is a process that is often unsuccessful, though — and one that is inappropriate when the parents are the victims in a criminal case. The crimes for which those between the ages of 10 — when they can first be legally charged — and 17 are most often arrested include theft, battery, drug offenses and liquor violations, according to the KBI's statistics for 2017. "The vast majority of cases we have are drugs or property crimes — vandalism, shoplifting, thefts, that kind of thing — and then threats," Yoder said. There has also been a rise in felony crimes, such as threatening group violence. "People sometimes complain that we overreact, but if anyone threatens group violence against anybody — a school, church, group of people, whatever — we're going to charge it as a criminal felony threat and we're going to prosecute it," Yoder said. Both high school and middle school students have been arrested for selling drugs. "They're committing more and more serious, adult crimes at younger and younger ages," Yoder said. "...We take it seriously, and we prosecute them for distribution." Sex crimes such as rape, aggravated sodomy and child molestations have also been on the rise. "I've got far more sex crimes involving juveniles than I had when I started here 18 years ago," Yoder said. "...We've got an alarming number of cases dealing with teenagers having sex with 9- and 10-year-old girls." Murphy had a word of caution for concerned parents. "Be aware of what your children are doing; be involved with them, in their activities and be aware of who their friends are," Murphy advised.<end_of_turn>

# Enigmatic Beluga whale lets people pet it in Artic Norway

Enigmatic Beluga whale lets people pet it in Artic Norway  COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) - A beluga whale found in Arctic Norway with a tight harness that is believed to have links to a military facility in Russia is so tame that residents can pet the mammal on its nose.  The white whale has been frolicking in the frigid harbor of Tufjord, a hamlet near Norway's northernmost point, and has become a local attraction. It is so comfortable with people that it swims to the dock.  Resident Linn Saether told Norwegian broadcaster NRK on Tuesday the whale "is so tame that when you call it, it comes to you."  On Friday, a fisherman removed the harness, which has a mount for a camera. It wasn't clear why the strap was attached to the mammal or whether it was part of any Russian military activity in the region.  Joergen Ree Wiig tries to reach the harness attached to a beluga whale before the Norwegian fishermen were able to removed the tight harness, off the northern Norwegian coast Friday, April 26, 2019. The harness strap which features a mount for an action camera, says "Equipment St. Petersburg" which has prompted speculation that the animal may have escaped from a Russian military facility.

# 10 ways Cinco de Mayo is celebrated differently in the US and Mexico

Cinco de Mayo is celebrated in the US and Mexico But it’s much smaller in Mexico than it is in America. In Mexico, celebrations are smaller and focused on military wins while in America, celebrations focus on drinking and eating. Visit INSIDER.com for more stories. Cinco de Mayo, or the fifth of May, is a pretty popular holiday to celebrate in the United States, although its roots lie in Mexico.  In 1861, Mexico was in a state of financial ruin and distress, and the new president, at the time, Benito Juárez was forced to default on debt payments to various European governments. Those governments decided to send troops to Veracruz, Mexico to demand their money. All but France withdrew their forces. Instead, Napoleon III, the ruler of France at the time drove out Juárez and his government.  On May 5, 1862, the French troops – about 6,000 in number – attacked a small town in east-central Mexico called Puebla de Los Ángeles. They were led by General Charles Latrille de Lorencez and armed with heavy artillery. In response, Juárez sent 2,000 of his men to Puebla to fight the French troops. The battle didn’t last long, from sunup to sundown. In the battle, the French lost about 500 soldiers, while the Mexican troops lost less than 100 men. The winning of the Battle of the Puebla represented a great victory for the Mexican government and has been solidified in Mexico’s history.  The celebration of this day is very different in the United States than it is in Mexico. Here are a few ways that the celebration differs throughout each country:  In the US, Cinco de Mayo started as a way to celebrate Mexican heritage but it’s seen as a festival anyone can be involved in.  source Paul Stein Although many use Cinco de Mayo as another day to party, the holiday is widely celebrated in parts of the country that have big Mexican-American populations, and large festivals in cities like Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; Portland, Seattle; and St. Paul, Minnesota.  Cinco de Mayo was first celebrated in the United States in 1863 in Southern California. The celebration was in support of solidarity with Mexico against French rule. By the 1930s the holiday became an opportunity to celebrate Mexican identity, promote ethnic consciousness and build community solidarity.   In Mexico, it’s more regional.  source Wikimedia Commons Cinco de Mayo is not observed throughout the whole of Mexico. It is primarily celebrated only in Puebla de Los Ángeles, with smaller celebrations in other parts as well.   In America, it’s become commercialized.  source Bryan Bedder/Getty Images In the 1950s and 60s, the holiday transformed as a way to honor Mexican-American pride. The holiday began to take on corporate sponsors and become commercialized.  In Mexico, it’s not Independence Day as many believe, but has remained a smaller holiday.  source Flickr/S Pakhrin Though many Americans assume Cinco de Mayo is Mexican Independence Day, that’s not true. It is simply to remember the victory at the Battle of the Puebla. Actual Mexican Independence Day is September 16.  It’s not a federal holiday in America and most people won’t get off work for it.  source Jamey Price/Getty Images Children remain in school and people have to go to work for the most part.  Children get off school for it in Mexico.  source Shutterstock It’s not a federal holiday in Mexico either. Students get off from school for the holiday, but everything else is scheduled programming.  In America, it’s seen for many as a drinking holiday.  source Flickr/ k4dordy Parties might include Mariachi bands and other Mexican folk music, and even traditional Mexican dancing. But just like other holidays in the US, it may lead to cultural appropriation as those not of Mexican descent may feel comfortable wearing sombreros, fake mustaches, and ponchos.  In some parts of Mexico, it’s seen more as a holiday around the military.  source Shutterstock Military parades, recreations of the Battle of Puebla, and other festivities take place. The Cinco de Mayo Parade is one of the main events for that day in Puebla. The parade usually boasts over 20,000 participants features Mariachis, colorful costumes, dancing, and fireworks, and usually runs along Boulevard Cinco de Mayo.  In America, it’s often celebrated with authentic — and not so authentic — Mexican food.  source Shutterstock In Mexico, it’s celebrated in some parts with a Mole Festival.  source Shutterstock / JuanSalvador Another big event that happens is the International Mole Festival. This festival, while was only incorporated in the celebration since 2012, celebrates mole poblano, which originated in Puebla. There are culinary discussions, exhibitions, and tastings which feature international, national, and regional chefs.<end_of_turn>

# Elyria JCPenney's to close, company officials confirm

JCPenney’s Elyria location at Midway Mall will close July 5, according to company officials. Company spokesperson Carter English said in a statement to The Morning Journal that the store is expected as a result of the company’s annual review. “This decision is the result of an ongoing review of our store portfolio, which includes assessing locations that may not meet our required financial targets or represent an opportunity to capitalize on a beneficial real estate asset," English said. "It’s never easy taking actions that directly impact our valued associates and customers. However, we feel this is a necessary business decision.” Elyria Mayor Holly Brinda expressed disappointment for the loss of JCPenney’s and its employees. “It’s unfortunate that Elyria has succumbed to what people have seen all over the United States with retail changing their business model,” Brinda said. Elyria officials have a plan to help attract regional businesses to the area that are less likely to be duplicated at another mall with hotels and family entertainment, she said. “The city of Elyria does have a redevelopment plan for that area," Brinda said. "And we know that the area does need to change to return it to productive use. “We are encouraging projects that fit with our redevelopment plan.” The city is working with the owner of Sears and Red Lobster to examine re-purposing those spaces back to productive use in distribution and logistics, she said. “There is a strategy, and we’re working it slow, but sure," Brinda said. "But it sure doesn’t take away from the unfortunate closing. “The city of Elyria will continue to influence the positive redevelopment of those properties as much as we possibly can. It could be that the closure of Penney’s is the incentive that they need.” Eligible associates who do not transfer to another JCPenney location will receive separation benefits and all impacted associates may participate in a three hour on-site career training class, at no cost to the associate, which offers tips on resume writing, answering interview questions and more, English said. The announcement comes in the wake of the release of JCPenney’s fourth quarter financial results where the company reported a net loss of $255 million. The Elyria location is among 27 closures announced by the company, including 18 full-line stores and nine ancillary home and furniture stores. "The stores identified for closure either require significant capital, are minimally cash flow positive today relative to the company's overall consolidated average or represent a real estate monetization opportunity," according to the company's statement. "Comparable sales performance for the closing stores was significantly below the remaining store base, and these stores operate at a much higher expense rate given the lack of productivity.” There was no information released on the JCPenney store in Avon.<end_of_turn>

# How to add Puppet Agents to Foreman

How to add Puppet Agents to Foreman  On this page  Step 1 - Setup Hosts Step 2 - Install and Configure Puppet Agent Step 3 - Sign Certificate Requests of the Puppet Agents Step 4 - Testing Links This is the second part of the Foreman tutorial. In the first guide, we've already shown you the installation and configuration of Foreman on Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS and now I will show you how to add Puppet Agents to Foremen.  Prerequisites  Foreman Puppet Master Root privileges What we will do?  Setup Hosts Install and Configure Puppet Agent Sign Certificates on the Foreman Puppet Master Testing Step 1 - Setup Hosts  First of all, we need to configure the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of puppet agent servers. Change the hostname of the server using the hostnamectl command below.  hostnamectl set-hostname client.hakase-labs.io 
 After that, edit the '/etc/hosts' file.  vim /etc/hosts 
 Change the IP address and the FQDN with your own and paste into it.  10.9.9.20   server.hakase-labs.io   server 10.9.9.21   client.hakase-labs.io   client 
 Save and close.  Now test the host using the following command and make sure you get the FQDN of the server is resolved to your valid IP address.  ping $(hostname -f) -c 3 
 Step 2 - Install and Configure Puppet Agent  In this step, we're going to install the Puppet Agent 5 on Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 7 servers. We want to add the Puppet repository to the system, and then install the puppet agent packages on both Ubuntu and CentOS servers.  - Install Puppet Agent on Ubuntu 18.04 Server  Download the package repository and add it to the system.  cd /tmp && wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet5-release-bionic.deb sudo dpkg -i puppet5-release-bionic.deb 
 After that, update ubuntu repositories and install the puppet agent packages using the following apt commands.  sudo apt update sudo apt install -y puppet-agent 
 - Install Puppet Agent on CentOS 7 Server  Download the package repository and add it to the system.  cd /tmp && wget https://yum.puppet.com/puppet5/puppet5-release-el-7.noarch.rpm rpm -ivh puppet5-release-el-7.noarch.rpm 
 After that, install the puppet agent packages using the following command.  sudo yum install -y puppet-agent 
 When the installation is complete, we must edit the default puppet configuration and define the agent settings.  Go to the '/etc/puppetlabs/puppet' directory and edit the configuration file 'puppet.conf'.  cd /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ vim puppet.conf 
 Change the server FQDN and the certname with your own and paste into it.  [agent]     server = server.hakase-labs.io     certname = client.hakase-labs.io     runinterval = 180     environment = production     listen = false     pluginsync = true     report = true 
 Save and exit.  After that, run the puppet agent service using the following command.  sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppet ensure=running enable=true 
 Or if required, restart the service.  sudo systemctl restart puppet 
 The puppet agent is up and running on both Ubuntu and CentOS servers.  Step 3 - Sign Certificate Requests of the Puppet Agents  In order to sign the certificate requests of the puppet agents, we can use the terminal shell of the puppet master server (in this case is the foreman server itself) or using the foreman dashboard.  - Sign Certificate Requests using Terminal Shell  Login to the puppet master server (in this guide is the foreman server) and check the certificate request using the following command.  sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca list 
 Now you will see the client name certificate, sign with the command below.  sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign --certname client.hakase-labs.io 
 And the puppet agent certificate has been added to the puppet master through the terminal server.  - Sign Certificate Requests using the Foreman Dashboard  Click the 'Infrastructure' menu on the left, then choose the 'Smart Proxies'.  Now select the 'Certificates' options from the drop-down button of the foreman server.  Now you will get the client name that makes requests on the 'pending' state, click the 'Sign' button.  After that, verify the agent hosts by going to the 'Hosts' page.  Inside the 'Hosts' menu, click 'All Hosts' and make sure you get the name of the puppet agent on the server list as below.  Below details about the Ubuntu Puppet Agent.  Step 4 - Testing  In this tutorial, we're going to test the puppet foreman server and puppet agent for deploying the nginx and NTP services to the puppet agent host. Before we begin, we need to download the nginx and ntp puppet modules to the foreman server and then activate these modules and add it to the puppet agent.  - Download Nginx Puppet Module  Download the nginx puppet module by running the following command on the puppet master foreman server.  sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet module install puppet/nginx 
 - Activate Puppet Modules  After that, import the nginx module through the foreman dashboard.  Click the 'Configure' menu on the left and click Puppet 'Classes'.  Click the 'Import Environment from server.hakase-labs.io' button, tick available module classes and click 'Update'.  Now you will get the Nginx module on the list.  - Add Puppet Module to Agent Host  Click the 'Hosts' menu on left, click 'All Hosts' to get lists of available hosts.  Now click the 'Edit' button on the agent host named 'client.hakase-labs.io'.  Goto the 'Puppet Classes' tab, add the 'nginx' and 'ntp' module and click the 'Submit' button.  The Nginx and NTP modules have been added to the Agent host.  Additional:  If you want to verify active classes on the Hosts, just click the 'YAML' button on the details information about the host and you will be shown the raw source of YAML configuration.  - Apply and Test  If you want to apply the changes manually, you can run the following command on the puppet agent hosts.  sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test 
 When it's complete, you will show the result as below.  After that, verify the nginx and ntp service by checking the listed port to ensure the HTTP and NTP ports are used by the nginx and ntp services.  netstat -plntu 
 Now you can access the nginx web server on the agent node.  curl client.hakase-labs.io 
 To verify the ntp server configuration, run the following command.  cat /etc/ntp.conf 
 And you will be shown the ntp configuration that is managed by Puppet.<end_of_turn>

# Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘to raise their child as gender fluid’

[Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS]  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are believed to be trying to avoid imposing stereotypes on their child.  It is believed that former Suits star Meghan, 37, was openly speaking about the decision at her recent New York baby shower.  [Getty]  A source close to the couple told Vanity Fair: “She was talking openly about it.  Top Stories  “Meghan has been talking to some of her friends about the birth and how she and Harry plan to raise their baby. Her exact work was ‘fluid’.  “She said they plan to raise their child with a fluid approach to gender and they won’t be imposing any stereotypes.”  [SplashNews.com]  Gender fluidity has become more popular among parents who decide to avoid dressing their newborns in typical pink or blue clothing.  They also provide their children with a variety of toys including both dolls and trucks, which are usually associated with girls or boys.  However, a small group of parents take the fluidity to another level, refusing to identify their children as “he” or “she.”  [Samir Hussein/WireImage]  Following Meghan’s New York baby shower, it is believed that Kate Middleton will be throwing seven months pregnant Meghan a second party in England.  A source told Us Weekly: “There is still going to be some sort of private baby-centric event for Meghan’s UK people, and Kate will host.  “Her glam people and other relatives will be there. Not sure if it’s a total baby ‘shower’, but you could probably call it that.”<end_of_turn>

# Baring, L&T said to lead bidding for Mindtree stake

Baring, L&T said to lead bidding for Mindtree stake Mindtree shares have climbed about 8 percent this year and rose 2.5 per cent in Friday trading. Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd. and Baring Private Equity Asia are the leading bidders for a major stake in Mindtree Ltd., as the Indian tech services and consulting firm’s largest shareholder seeks to sell his holding, according to people familiar with the matter. Larsen & Toubro and Baring are both offering 950 to 1,000 rupees a share and a decision may come as soon as next week, one of the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. V.G. Siddhartha, the largest shareholder in Mindtree, is selling a stake of about 20 percent that he holds through Coffee Day Enterprises and affiliated entities. The deal would be valued at about 34 billion rupees ($480 million) at the top of the price range. Other suitors including private equity firm KKR & Co. remain interested, the people said. No final decision has been made and the companies could still decide against pursuing a deal. Baring declined to comment. Larsen & Toubro Infotech, KKR and the office of V.G. Siddhartha did not respond to requests for comment. Siddhartha is selling the stake as he shifts his attention from technology consulting to an expansion of his Cafe Coffee Day business. The chain is challenging Starbucks in India and is aiming to expand to more than 2,000 stores in the next few years. Mindtree competes with Larsen & Toubro, Infosys Ltd. and other rivals in supporting corporate customers that need tech expertise. Mindtree’s management would prefer the stake not go to Larsen & Toubro because of competitive tensions, one of the people said. However, that may not prove the deciding factor, the person said. Mindtree shares have climbed about 8 percent this year and rose 2.5 percent in Friday trading.<end_of_turn>

# Drama sets stage for ‘Uncle Vanya’ at Delta

Delta Drama’s production of Uncle Vanya by Anton Chekov, directed by Ashlee Temple, opens March 1 at 7 p.m., in the Alfred Muller Studio Theater. The show will run through March 10, and admission is free.  The story takes place in pre-revolution Russia and focuses on a family with dwindling wealth.  “What’s interesting about these plays and Anton Chekhov is that you see in the plays the rise of communism and it starting to take place but it hasn’t affected the government yet. So basically what it is is that it hasn’t affected the middle class it’s just you either have an extreme amount of money and you’re on top or you are suffering everyday of your life. That was basically the extreme,” said actor Nick Giovannoni who plays Vanya, the lead.  He views this play as an opportunity to grow as an actor since his previous roles revolved around “having a shtick”.  Navaz Khan, who plays Astrov the district doctor, claims his character gets thrown into a huge love circle throughout the duration of the play. The Professor is portrayed by Christopher Hunter. In the context of the play he is on his last leg, much older than any other character. His marriage to the young woman, Yelena causes controversy.  “I don’t walk with a cane, go figure, I have to pretend. Saying my lines to out speak a mindset of this old man that wants everything but can’t have it all. I don’t think he’s in love with the wife I think he’s in lust with the wife. I think he maybe at one point was, but then again at the same time he is a 60 year old man- kind of an old pervert,” said Hunter.  Many costumes were made by hand in the costume department. The set displays an unkempt estate with backlighting made of sunshine at times. In the play, audience members should expect a gunshot. The actors trained with a stage gun and blank bullets.  “I love Chekhov, he’s my favorite playwright I’m just thrilled to come here every night and work on this and I have a great cast so it’s so enjoyable to be in this world and create this world with this cast,” said Director Ashlee Temple.<end_of_turn>

This is Kylli's second year in a series of conversations with neighbors to share ideas and gather input. Previous community Open Houses have generated important input from Santa Clarans and Kylli is seeking more feedback as the project team continues to pencil in the details.  When complete, the project will also feature 3.65 million square feet of office space, 6,000 housing units (with an affordable component), 400,000 square feet of retail, a hotel, and facilities geared toward education and daycare uses.

# Super Eagles fullback Ola Aina set for a permanent move to Torino from Chelsea after an impressive loan spell in Italy

Super Eagles star Ola Aina is set for a permanent move to Serie A side Torino from Chelsea after an impressive loan spell in Italy.  Aina who started his career at Chelsea joined Torino on a season-loan deal and has been impressive for the Serie A side.  The club has now decided to exercise the option of signing the Super Eagles star on a permanent basis for £8.7m.  Chelsea are also happy to sign off on the deal as they look to trim down on their infamous loan army due to FIFA’s plans to place a limit the number of professionals allowed to leave on loan from each club between six and eight from the 2020-21 season, although there will be exemptions granted to homegrown under-21 players when loaned out domestically.  End of Chelsea stay  If the move for Aina is finalised, it will be the end of his stay at Chelsea, the club he joined at the U11s.  After making it through the grades, he trained with the first team and travelled with them for a couple of pre-season games under Jose Mourinho in 2015.  He made just three appearances for Chelsea before he joined Hull City on loan in 2017 and spent the season playing in the Championship.  Since joining Torino in 2018, Aina has impressed at the club and became a regular.  He has had to play from the left as a wing-back in Walter Mazzarri side and has scored one goal in 22 league games.<end_of_turn>

Catherine Zeta-Jones poses on red carpet with her lookalike children at Welsh gala From theater to television to film, actress Catherine Zeta-Jones has done it all. But the Oscar winner says there's no place like the small screen these days. (March 23) AP It was a family affair for Catherine Zeta-Jones on Friday, as she celebrated St. David’s Day in style on the red carpet with both of her children. The Welsh actress commemorated St. David's Day, which is a celebration of the patron saint of Wales, at the Wales’ National Day Gala, at which she received an honorary degree. Zeta-Jones' son Dylan Michael Douglas, 18, and daughter Carys Zeta Douglas, 15, hit the red carpet at the Rainbow Room in New York City, where their stylish mother received the honor from the The Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama. Dylan looked smoldering in a black suit, while Carys was her mother's twin in an off-the-shoulder patterned gown. Zeta-Jones' husband Michael Douglas, Dylan and Carys' father, was not in attendance at the event. Zeta-Jones, 49, stunned in a deep wine-colored, off-the-shoulder velvet dress, complete with a thigh-high slit. She paired the look with matching heels and dangling earrings. The actress has recently brought her children out to events more frequently, with Carys accompanying her to New York Fashion Week events, including the Michael Kors shows in February and in September 2018.

# US offers $1 million reward in hunt for bin Laden's son

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government is offering $1 million for help tracking down the son of the late terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.  A State Department notice Thursday says the reward will be paid for help locating Hamza bin Laden in any country as part its "rewards for justice" program.  The announcement says bin Laden's son has emerged as a leader of the al-Qaida terrorist group. His father was killed in a U.S. military raid in Pakistan in May 2011.  Hamza bin Laden was named a "specially designated global terrorist" in January 2017. He has released audio and video messages calling for attacks against the U.S. and its allies.  Al-Qaida was responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other notorious actions.  Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

# New Delhi returns body of Pakistani prisoner killed in India jail

WAGAH/LAHORE: India has handed over the body of a Pakistani prisoner who was killed while serving jail time in the northern state of Rajasthan.  Shakirullah was stoned to death by other inmates at Jaipur Central Jail on Feb. 20, following weeks of anti-Pakistan sentiment in the wake of a suicide attack that killed more than 40 Indian soldiers.  The body of the slain inmate was handed over at the Wagah-Attari border post a day after Pakistan released Indian pilot, Abhinandan Varthaman, as a peace gesture.  Pakistan's Ansar Burney Trust and its high commission in New Delhi helped with the repatriation of the body, which was kept in a Rajasthan morgue.  Shakirullah's brother and his wife had protested at the border post on Friday, urging Pakistan not to free the Indian pilot until the body had been returned. “My brother was mentally unstable,” Shahzad Gulfam told Arab News.  “He accidentally crossed over to India from Sialkot in 2001. He was reported missing as we never knew he was in India. For us, it was a shock when we saw his picture on TV channels."  The Pakistani government lodged a strong protest with India over the incident and demanded extra security be provided to Pakistanis in Indian jails.  “It is heart-wrenching that we could not see our brother for so many years and just came to know that he was murdered in an Indian jail. They should give us his body at least so we can see his face one last time,” Shakirullah's sister-in-law Robina Shahzad told Arab News.  “These are very sad moments in our lives. My brother is dead now but I am satisfied that we would bury him in our ancestral graveyard. We had sleepless nights thinking about our mentally challenged brother,” Gulfam added.<end_of_turn>

# Tackling Driver Turnover – Part Two - Over The Road

In Part One, we talked about the delusion of the industry. We talked about the sales job to the inside the walls personnel and we talked a little about apathy. The next step if you were to follow the process of our retention action plan at TCA would be to establish how we as a company will conduct ourselves moving forward. Not only in regards to driver turnover but in all of our business interactions, customers, suppliers, the communities we operate in, the motoring public, government agencies and alike.  Of course, I’m talking about company values and I am treading softly here because I see many companies expressing their company values statement very proudly on their websites and they look and read great. The issue that can come to play is that in many cases, the statement was created in a cocoon. What I mean by that is, it is quite likely that the statement was developed with the assistance of a well-intended consultant. Possibly at a corporate retreat where the senior management team bonds for a weekend and produces a document designed to become a shining beacon for all to follow.  The potential problem is that when someone tells me how to act, or tells me to act in accordance to their values rather than my own, I immediately question their intentions. And by the way, what about my core values; do they mean nothing to you? My core values were instilled in me by my parents, my mentors, my grandparents, teachers and my friends etc. What the goal should be is to turn personal values into shared values and for that, we need a consensus where everyone who chooses to participate in the exercise helps develop the statement and is strongly encouraged to do so.  I believe the best way of gaining consensus on a value statement is to ask everyone in the business to contribute to the effort. If done this way, they truly are shared values and I believe have much more power when they are challenged or bumped up against during any given situation. So here is the question for your people. “In a single paragraph, please describe the ideal company you would like to work for. Please make your description short and to the point”. The nice thing with this is that we, as humans, share many of the same values. We want honesty, respect, opportunity, accountability, clarity etc.  When my company went through this exercise, I called the value statement we collectively came up with ‘my sword’. I used it on many occasions and I truly believe it had more power because I could say that we, as a group, had decided on the statement rather than creating the statement with an outside consultant brought in by ownership for all to be guided. My friend Geoff Topping VP, HR over at Challenger Motor Freight puts this in perspective while explaining things to new employees. They have a Vision, Mission and Values statements that they teach to all new hires. For his folks to better understand the statements, he calls them The Dream, The Direction and The Behaviour, which is a great way to put a different paradigm onto the subject.  What you have started to do here is build the platform. When you have high turnover in a company, there is a genuine likelihood that your drivers don’t believe too much of what management has to say. I genuinely hope that I don’t offend when I state this but it is likely true. So before you put your retention plan in place, you have to build a solid foundation from which to launch it. It would be best if you got the people inside your walls all pulling in the same direction.  Once you have the groundwork done, the next step is to thoroughly understand exactly where you are in the marketplace and where you are when you are competing to recruit and retain drivers. To some, this might seem obvious but believe me, many companies do not get this part right. Here is the question; where are you relative to the competition and does that position match your company’s growth expectations and budget? If your company has a growth expansion plan, you had better place your Driver and Owner Operator remuneration in the upper quartile for your geographic area or good luck with ever achieving your goals. Similarly, if your plan is focused on increased operating revenue without substantial growth, you might be okay with being at the midpoint or a little higher. If you aren’t monitoring this essential element of your retention efforts, then get on it now!  If you have high turnover, your company is likely being measured entirely by your remuneration package by your Drivers and Owner Operators. This is a sad truth, but a real one. With that in mind, perception is reality and how things look is important. In my own experience, we simplified the Owner-Operator pay so that we paid our contractors a net amount after all the items we added and then deducted from their pay had been netted out. It was straightforward and we were proud of what we had done for our Owner Operators. However, after a while we started getting complaints that the competition was paying a higher rate. Sure they had deductions too, but they were apparently getting a higher top line than our Owner Operators – or so they believed. After explanations failed to calm the situation, we changed our payment system to add in the details of all the items we paid on behalf of the Owner Operators and then showed the corresponding deductions. For instance, we showed a 5-cent per mile item for license plates – and then a 5-cent deduction for those plates. Also, there was the 3 cents for insurance along with a deduction later on for the insurance we paid. There were several items like this with the Owner Operator now getting a grossed up per mile pay rate, followed by the itemized deductions of all these items.  The new gross line ended up higher than the competition (they were being paid better all along) but the net amount was the same as it was before. It cost us nothing to do, but now the Owner Operators were satisfied and the complaints stopped. We did not deceive anyone. We told everyone what we were doing. Lesson learned. Perception is the reality. That is important to keep in mind when looking at various pay packages and techniques.

# The priority skill our kids need to learn: Meditation | Malay Mail

MARCH 4 — During the Tham Luang cave rescue last year, the 12 kids and their coach were trapped for more than a week before they were found by British divers.  The very thought gives one the shivers: Trapped in near absolute darkness more than two miles inside an underground labyrinth which floods.  Their eventual rescue was a miracle of human achievement worth celebrating; the quieter miracle, however, was how they were able to maintain their sanity at all.  Because the average teenager or young adult gets upset over the smallest things; when “triggered” by a Facebook post, or when hungry, or if insulted, or if the wifi is down. How did those 12 boys make it?  Later it was revealed that the 12 were taught something crucial by their coach during the crisis. What was that skill which helped them cope in a hopeless situation for a week? Meditation.  A quiet source of power  Nowadays, kids are being taught all sorts of things from an early age: Sports, drama, “life-skills”, leadership, coding, tech, dance and just about whatever it takes to get 10 As in PT3, SPM and beyond.  But what about meditation?  Yes, I know, at first blush it sounds weird. Even I can’t imagine dozens of kids or teenagers in a school hall sitting in lotus position, all with eyes closed, repeating a mantra over and over again.  Then again, this may simply reflect how “alien” and non-institutionalised the practice of meditation is.  Which is, frankly, surprising given the benefits of meditation.  Meditation ─ a category which loosely includes mindfulness, or mental “priming”, or visualisation ─ can bring about better focus, clearer thinking, less impulsiveness in decision-making, less reactive-ness, being more “awake.”  Folks who meditate develop a greater sense of awareness (of self and one’s surroundings), facilitating stronger prioritisation, or that appreciation of the truly important things in life.  Put another way, to meditate is to fill our minds with the positive, the wise, the beautiful, the pure, the right, the admirable.  To think about these qualities and to immerse our hearts with the good ─ and to do so at regular intervals throughout the day, not least the first thing in the morning! ─ is to cultivate a mental frame vastly different to what most people do in their lives.  Meditation, therefore, is really about training our minds to have better control over our (often volatile) emotions, and even transforming our emotions such that the positive and more inspiring ones remain at the fore most of the time.  As author Tim Ferriss puts it, meditation can make the difference between standing outside in the storm and being blasted by rain, hail and wind and standing inside your house and looking at the storm.  Taking out the mental trash  The average student or employee takes very bad care of his or her mind.  From the moment we awake, we fill ourselves with non-stop social media messages, photos and links, all of which are blasting into our heads from the time we get dressed to the time we leave the house, during the commute, before during and after classes and work, during meal-times, when we get home, then all throughout the evening and finally before we sleep (and for some the phone is a substitute for shut-eye).  Add to this all the pressure and judgment from the people we interact with, and is it any wonder the average Malaysian is barely three steps from a nervous breakdown?  With platforms like Facebook and Twitter, we sometimes witness mob attacks in which hordes of would-be “social justice warriors” heap vile and vicious attacks on writers or personalities they object to.  What many don’t realise is that this entire process, whilst seemingly damaging the target of our hatred alone, does not leave us unharmed; when we pour hate and disgust on others, our psyches suffer too.  You simply can’t be cursing another person in a Facebook group and not have that condemnation rub off on you somehow.  Apart from social media, in our everyday lives our brains have a tendency to re-play very bad movies in our minds i.e. mental films which make us envious, jealous, greedy or just feeling wronged.  Our psyche resembles a canoe going upstream in which “doing nothing” brings us down.  Now just consider the average student facing sibling rivalry, homework they can’t handle, exams they’d rather not take, sexuality and identity issues, peer pressure, etc.  All of these concerns processed and played out at home, in the school and on social media 24/7 and ─ voilà ─ you have a recipe for psychological catastrophe.  The practice of meditation, at the very least, acts as a cerebral substitute. Instead of populating our minds with despair, rejection and lethargy, we throw in hope, cheer and determination.  It’s about regularly taking out the trash in our heads and cleaning things up a bit.  If we teach our students to meditate and “perform” mindfulness on a regular basis, we would be strengthening their minds and equipping them with mental tools to ward off dejection and despondency.  Recalling the Tham Luang cave ordeal again, one of the key reasons why the trapped kids managed to keep sane and calm for so many days (in the darkness) was because their coach taught them how to meditate throughout the crisis.  Despite being in such a hopeless situation, those 12 boys not only managed to “hold on” psychologically, but also maintain a measure of cheerfulness.  Now, imagine our boys and girls in school being taught how to uphold a sense of courage, gratitude and fearlessness come what may.  Imagine that, no matter how difficult Maths is, Ahmad ─ via daily sessions of mindfulness ─ keeps it together, manages to push away all talk of failure as premature, focuses on the formulae and tasks at hand, and manages to progress if not excel.  Imagine that, no matter how cruel the comments regarding her body are, Melanie ─ through the regular practice of deep breathing and self-awareness ─ is able to sustain a sense of gratitude that all her limbs and organs are functioning perfectly, realise “super-model” figures are an unrealistic achievement, that her source of pride lies with her ability to serve people and enjoy the world in all its beauty.  Imagine that, no matter how bad the troubles are in the family, Rani ─ by nurturing creative imagination ─ is able to envision better times and more loving conversations, and is thus able to act as a beacon of cheer and joy in the middle of her parents’ constant arguing and her siblings’ never-ending contests.  Start now  Via Google, you can easily find many articles about how to get started, advanced meditation techniques, “the first thing successful people do in the morning to prepare for their day” lists and so on.  But off the top of my head, there are a few easy practices a beginner can try.  To prepare to meditate, maybe the very first thing to do would be to turn off your phone or put it into airplane mode (and try not to look at your phone the first thing in the morning).  Secondly, find a place where you can sit comfortably and close your eyes for at least 10 minutes without any awkwardness. Put on some soft music if it helps.  Next ─ and these are some “concrete” action-steps involved in many meditative practices (again, more are available in Google) ─ learn to focus on your breathing.  Simply attend to your moment-by-moment act of breath-taking, listen, be calm and be present.  Be “here” in the moment, drop anchor into the Now and drift away into the (usually anxious) future or (usually painful) past; and let your heart and the movement of your chest (as it takes in and releases air) be all that you’re observing in your mind.  The above acts of mindfulness are necessary to calm us down and keep our emotions, our impulsiveness and our knee-jerk reactions in check.  After a few minutes you may begin to bring to mind your family, the people you love, your friends. And, one by one, begin to say a soft Thank You to them and for them, for just being part of your life.  The point here is to hold in mind the most precious people in your life, for they are the reasons your day is beginning; they are why you work, why you study, etc.  The above constitutes disciplines of gratitude and prioritisation; nothing better than love and joy to keep fear and anger at bay.  Finally, another step some people take is to visualise what you want to achieve in the next hour, this day, the coming week or the next few months. In your mind, see these goals as accomplished, feel them as done, experience yourself as having achieved them.  When coupled with the people for whom you are having these outcomes, such visualisation practices help you maintain a strong sense of desire and motivation.  The steps listed here are concise to a fault. But I think if you (or your children) try even a few of them, the benefits can be reaped almost immediately.  Try them, or research and try something. A few minutes a day or more; it could make a world of difference.  * Email me at [email protected] if you have questions about meditation. I am not an expert but will be happy to share resources and ideas.  ** This is the personal opinion of the columnist.<end_of_turn>

# Stacey Dooley: 'It hurts' Strictly winner speaks out on ‘people making fun'

Stacey Dooley said “of course it hurts” when she reads “snooty comments” criticising her accent and the fact she left school at 16. The Strictly Come Dancing winner grew up on a council estate with her single mother Dianne, before bursting onto the television scene. The 31-year-old said she has “more life experiences” than most as she hit back in an interview with YOU Magazine last weekend. It comes after she was awarded an MBE for services to broadcasting last year, but missed the ceremony. Some people can’t believe the audacity of my covering important subjects Stacey told the publication: “Some people can’t believe the audacity of my covering important subjects.” She continued after previously being branded “whiny”: “Of course it hurts when people make fun of how I talk. “Especially when I’ve probably got more life experiences than someone who studied at Oxbridge and went straight into the Beeb.” On when she’ll collect her MBE, she stated: “We’ll go sometime this year.” Meanwhile, during her chat, Stacey broke her silence on Strictly co-star Seann Walsh’s kiss with married partner Katya Jones. She stated: “When you do what I do for a living, in the scheme of things it doesn’t bother me who’s kissing who.” But she did think fellow finalist Joe Sugg “had it in the bag” in the final: “But I never took it too seriously.” Stacey added: “I always thought, ‘If I don’t nail the Foxtrot, no one is going to die’.” She told her Instagram followers about her latest interview, in a post shared with her 683,000 fans. “@youmagazine… Out this weekend… discussing Strictly and my docs we’ve filmed overseas, over the last decade,” she captioned it. Wearing her tresses down in a loose wave, Stacey cut a glamorous figure in a silky gold dress. It comes after her Strictly professional partner Kevin Clifton hit out after he was confirmed for the 2019 line-up today. He claimed “nobody’s listening” when he said he does not want to leave the BBC show behind. It comes after the 36-year-old lifted the Glitterball in December before skipping the tour to appear in musical Rock Of Ages. Kevin told this week’s OK! Magazine: “I keep saying that I don’t want to leave Strictly, but nobody’s listening!” Glow Up begins on Wednesday at 10.35pm on BBC One.<end_of_turn>

# ‘Never Saw It Coming’ Lower Broadway Restaurant Rolled Over

The height of the new Encore Boston Harbor resort seems larger than life, but its shadow is even more massive, and restaurant owner Valery Joseph said it’s a shadow that has rolled over her small business to the point of closure.  Joseph, a longtime Everett resident, said she will close La Perle on Lower Broadway March 16, one of the last remaining small businesses in the area of the casino project.  The onslaught of construction worker parking, street closures, dust, endless traffic and changes in the traffic configuration (making it next to impossible to get to her restaurant) have just become too much for her to continue.  “I would have loved to stay,” she said from her empty, Caribbean-themed dining room on Monday. “I’ve been here since 2011. My location would be the perfect spot. I know Caribbean food is very popular and they weren’t going to have that in the casino. The customers try to come, but they can’t get here. It’s not easy for a group of people trying to come here and they’re circling and circling to find a spot. They just give up. It’s discouraging and they leave. We’ve been struggling the last year with this. If it weren’t for take-out and catering, we would have already closed. The casino is aware of it, but they don’t care. I don’t know what God has in store for me, but my plan is to re-open somewhere. I just never saw this coming. Never saw it.”  After a great run on Lower Broadway, she said she has had to cancel lucrative catering orders from universities like Northeastern and Boston University, as well as weddings and functions.  Joseph has lived in Everett with her family since coming from Haiti 16 years ago. After becoming a registered nurse, she dreamed of opening a restaurant in Everett with her family. In 2011, they moved on that dream and opened La Perle on Lower Broadway. Times were very good for the restaurant and it wasn’t uncommon for Joseph to have a packed house Thursday through Sunday.  While most all of their Caribbean food was popular, she said it was the fried goat (known as Tasso Kabrit in Haitian Creole) – with black rice – that attracted people by the dozens to her place.  Joseph also frequently ran community dinners to help feed the homeless and underprivileged in Everett, and she said the restaurant helped her pay to get a Master’s Degree and nursing certifications.  Even when the casino began to generate excitement on Lower Broadway, she said she was all for it. She put a sticker in the window and Encore sometimes would order large catering requests from her. It seemed like a win-win.  “Some of my customers would tell me it’s great, and others would say it wasn’t going to be great,” she said. “It went back and forth. I thought it would be good. I supported it; I put a sticker in my window. I didn’t know. I didn’t know it was that close, that it was going to have that kind of impact from across the street. If it’s across the street, how can I be in their way? Why do I have to be gone? That was my question and I just didn’t see this coming. We went back and forth with them, and they were not nice, but respectful. They do it as a business. It’s their job to push you away and feel you can’t do it anymore. That’s life.”  Joseph said it started with the construction parking, where constructions workers from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., seven days a week, and sometimes into the night, would flood the streets with their vehicles and take every available spot – despite the large parking lot available to them.  Councilors Fred Capone and Michael McLaughlin helped her to get 15-minute parking signs in front of her place to prohibit their parking, but she said they parked there anyway.  “Our customers had nowhere to park,” she said. “Even with the signs, I had to call dispatch and the Police Department to come get them out of my spots. It’s not friendly. My customers would give up. They would order food, but they couldn’t get here to pick it up. So, after trying, they would call and cancel. We would end up with all these orders. It’s hard for the customers. So, if they can’t get here and can’t park here, we have to move.”  Matters heightened when the road construction started last spring. With Broadway tied up, the back streets often closed, and Bow Street re-routed, Joseph said her business was all-but impossible to get to. Soon, when left-turn lanes were blocked, the delivery drivers from Uber Eats and other companies even stopped coming.  She said she went to the Chamber meetings for Lower Broadway businesses and the casino, but there was no progress – nothing changed she said. In fact, she said she only found more businesses near here that were angry and also suffering.  To top it off, her pest control company wasn’t able to get to the restaurant recently due to traffic, and they told her their monthly checks would double in price.  All of it added up to an inability for one to exist with the other, she said, so now she’s throwing in the towel.  She said she has hopes of going elsewhere in Everett, but the real estate market for restaurants isn’t easy – even in a place like Everett Square.  “I want to stay in Everett, but I don’t see anything in Everett,” she said. “It’s really about real estate. If I get something in Everett, it would be better for me to do the liquor transfer and not start from scratch. They know me at City Hall so it would be a smooth transfer. Again, I don’t know what my future holds, but I want to keep my business.”<end_of_turn>

# MPs hijacking Brexit legislation do not understand offshore tax havens

Let’s imagine I’m a wicked, criminal mastermind running an international enterprise. In order to operate the business, I need to set up lots of shell companies to shuttle money around, but without making any of it traceable. Where, do you think, would I set up shop?  A lot of people, including the MPs Margaret Hodge and Andrew Mitchell, would probably name offshore tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, Guernsey or the British Virgin Islands. Yesterday, these MPs were frothing with outrage after the Government pulled a bill that they had hoped to use as a vehicle to impose new transparency rules on Britain’s crown dependencies.  Behind the angry headlines about tax havens, the truth is that these...

# Man Utd star ‘is going to have to change his game… he’s got to stop’ - Don Hutchison

That’s the view of former Premier League midfielder Don Hutchison, who believes Smalling should have conceded a penalty against Southampton. Manchester United beat Southampton 3-2 on Saturday thanks to a late Romelu Lukaku goal but could have twice conceded spot-kicks. Smalling got away with one as he held Ryan Bertrand’s shirt in the box while Ashley Young also appeared to foul the same player. Stuart Atwell did not give either decision to the visitors at Old Trafford though did point to the spot for United late on. Paul Pogba missed that penalty though it didn’t prove decisive. But with VAR set to be introduced into the Premier League next season, Hutchison has sent a strong message to Smalling. “Chris Smalling is going to have to change his game, he’s got to learn,” Hutchison said. “Whoever the Manchester United manager is next season, they are going to be looking at him and telling him in pre-season ‘VAR is here, you’re not going to get away with that’. “He’s been getting away with that, Chris Smalling, for ten years and he’s got to stop.” Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl believes his side should have been awarded at least one penalty on Saturday. “I don’t know but if the first is the close thing then the second maybe should be one,” he said. “It doesn’t bring anything for me if we discuss it now. “I think this team showed today that they were really online, they were really focussed on getting something at Old Trafford against a team in the perfect performance and shape at the moment. “We were not scared and showed we can really play football at the moment and that we are believing in ourselves.” Manchester United are next in action on Wednesday as they travel to face Paris Saint-Germain. The Red Devils are 2-0 down heading into the Champions League last-16 second leg.<end_of_turn>

# Spooked? Christopher Steele Cancels Appearance After Cohen Testimony Destroys Dossier Allegation

Former MI6 spy Christopher Steele has suddenly backed out of a planned video appearance at a pro-democracy gathering in Baltimore next week for a group founded by Trump-hating chess champ Garry Kasparov, according to Politico.  The author of the largely unverified Trump-Russia dossier had been scheduled to discuss disinformation on a panel moderated by Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum, which is set to include Atlantic Council fellow Evelyn Farkas - a former deputy assistant secretary of defense who notably slipped up on live TV and admitted in March 2017 that the Obama administration had been spying on the Trump campaign.  Applebaum said that Steele had gotten "cold feet" last week and canceled on the advice of his legal counsel. As the Daily Caller's Chuck Ross notes, this would have been Steele's first public remarks in the nearly two years since BuzzFeed published his dossier.  Perhaps Steele was 'spooked' by testimony last week from former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who debunked a key claim in the dossier that he traveled to Prague in August 2016 to meet with Kremlin officials in order to arrange clandestine payments to hackers who stole emails from the Clinton campaign and the DNC.   Cohen only denied the Prague allegation during his open testimony, but GOP California Rep. Devin Nunes suggested on Monday that the former Trump fixer disputed all of the dossier’s allegations during a closed-door hearing before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence last Thursday. -Daily Caller  Steele's dossier was commissioned by Hillary Clinton's campaign through law firm Perkins Coie, which paid opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which in turn commissioned Steele to assemble the collection of reports which relied heavily on Kremlin officials.  The dossier was used by the US intelligence community to obtain a FISA surveillance warrant on Trump campaign aide Carter Page - along with anyone he was in communication with. Steele's report claimed that there was a "well-developed conspiracy of co-operation" between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.   The reports, which circulated among U.S. intelligence officials beginning in the summer of 2016 and were later published by BuzzFeed, helped set off a chain of events that led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. In the years since Steele authored his reports, evidence has emerged of extensive contacts between Trump’s aides and various Russian state-aligned actors, while many of the most salacious allegations in Steele’s reports remain unconfirmed or at least partially debunked. -Politico  The conference Steele backed out of will continue without him - and "will examine and wrestle with the underlying threats to liberal democracy and propose strategies to reinvigorate it," according to promotional materials.  Also in attendance will be Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), former Republican House majority leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and former undersecretary of defense for George W. Bush Paul Wolfowitz, per Politico. It is being organized by the Renew Democracy Initiative chaired by chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov.<end_of_turn>

# Matt Bevin says he would sign private school tax bill 'in a heartbeat'

"Why wouldn't we allow in this state somebody who wants to help a young person get the best possible chance in life?" he said. Tom Loftus, Louisville Courier Journal FRANKFORT, Ky. — Gov. Matt Bevin has come out in support of House Bill 205, which would offer Kentuckians tax breaks in exchange for donations to private school scholarship programs. "Why wouldn't we allow in this state somebody who wants to help a young person get the best possible chance in life?" he told reporters on Tuesday. The governor said he has no concern that the bill would hurt public education. "If you think that something that is good is hurt by something else that is good, then you don't really think the first thing is really very good ..." Bevin said. "Iron sharpens iron. If anything, both have the potential to get better." On Monday, school superintendents from across the state spoke out against the bill, saying it would damage public schools. The superintendents joined teachers who oppose the bill, saying the tax breaks — which could reach up to $50 million by the fourth year of the program — would leave less money for already under-funded public schools.

Just last month, the Real Housewives of New Jersey cast member embarked on a whirlwind romance with businessman Oliver Maier, got engaged, and planned to get married. Then, on the exact day they were set to wed, rumors suggested the couple had called it quits. However, while Staub and Maier aren’t yet married, they have not split.  On March 5, All About the Real Housewives offered an update on their relationship, confirming Staub had taken to her Instagram Stories on Tuesday to share a video of herself and Maier and let her fans and followers know there was no truth to the split rumors.  The clip she shared of herself and Maier was taken at the Baccarat Hotel in New York City, where Staub was seen kissing Maier and telling him he was her “love.”  “To put the rumors that he and I are not together, here I am with my love,” she told her online audience in her video clip.  Staub and Maier first confirmed their romance at the end of last month during a romantic getaway at Nikki Beach in St. Barth, where they posed for a photo in front of a rainbow.  Just last week, Staub told People magazine she was very much in love with Maier.  “I’m madly in love,” she shared. “I’m feeling elated and excited for the next stage of my life. I’m going to marry the man of my possible dreams and hopefully I’ll spend the rest of my life in bliss.”  While Staub claimed she wasn’t looking for a relationship when she and Maier first began dating earlier this year, he told the magazine he was hoping for a chance to be with her.  “People don’t like to take a risk, but I took a risk,” he explained. “Danielle’s one of the smartest people I’ve met. People have preconceived notions about her from reality TV, but she’s a smart women. And I was instantly attracted to that.”  Staub has been married three times and engaged 21 times. As fans well know, the reality star’s marriage to her most recent husband, Marty Caffrey, came to an end in September of last year after just three months.  To see more of Staub and her co-stars, don’t miss new episodes of The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 9 reunion special on Wednesday nights at 8 p.m. on Bravo TV.<end_of_turn>

# Ethiopia: Victory of Adwa Set Stage for African Freedom Struggle - Kenyan President

Addis Ababa — Ethiopia's decisive victory at Adwa affirmed and set the stage for the beginning of Africa's freedom struggle from colonialism, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said.  Ethiopians have been colorfully celebrating the 123rd anniversary of the victory of Adwa in which it defeated Fascist Italy.  President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is in Ethiopia for official visit, said the victory of Adwa sparked the global Pan-African Movement.  The president said the victory inspired the entire African countries for freedom struggle against colonialism.  Ethiopia was brought to the attention of the world in 1896 when the African country defeated Italy, a European country, at the Battle of Adwa.  According to Kenyatta, this great victory has been a source of inspiration for struggles for freedom throughout the pan-African world.  He added that Adwa has important lessons for Africans in their resistance against oppression and galvanizing unity among Africans.  The president also appreciated Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's leadership who has been exerting maximum effort to integrate the East African region.  Prime Minister Abiy said on his part Adwa is one of the great victories that our "forefathers paid much scarifies for a strong and united Ethiopia."  He further urged the youth to tolerate one another in the spirit of Adwa victory.<end_of_turn>

# WWE star Bayley addresses WrestleMania 35 - and the main event she wants to see

The Boss 'n' Hug Connection, consisting of Bayley and longtime friend/rival Sasha Banks, were crowned the inaugural champions last month.  The pair defeated five other teams inside an Elimination Chamber match at the self-titled pay-per-view to make history for the company.  Since capturing the belts, the duo have stated they’ll put them on the line in any WWE brands, including Raw, SmackDown, NXT and NXT UK.  Before that, however, they'll make their first defence against Nix Jax and Tamina at the Fastlane pay-per-view in Cleveland, Ohio this Sunday.  Speaking with Mirror Sport's Morgan Richards, Bayley talked about making history, overcoming the struggles of tag team wrestling , returning to NXT, the possibility of a Women's Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Invitational and what she believes needs to happen at WrestleMania on April 7.  And opening up on her and Sasha's emotions settling in as the first ever women tag champs, the 29-year-old, from Newark, California, reminisced about how desperate they were for the titles to become a reality, once they started to hear rumours backstage.  She said: "It's just a mixture of being very proud and very happy.  "This is something we never dreamt could be possible and once we realised that this is something that can be done, we went 110% towards it, worked for it and pushed for it.  "We got matching gear and worked on tag moves. We made everybody know that we wanted tag titles, so now that we have it and we get to represent the company, represent women, it's a very proud feeling. It's amazing, I can't believe that we're doing this and I'm so happy."  Seeing WWE's women's division go from strength to strength, Bayley revealed tag titles seemed the obvious next step for the women of WWE going forward.  She said: "You know it's funny, we've had so many tag matches at the live events and on Raw in the past, there's just so many tag matches that we thought it was just crazy that we didn't have tag titles that existed.  "There's so many women, so many talented women about. When we heard rumblings, even if it wasn't true, when we heard rumblings about possible tag titles then we just went all in and we just wanted to push for it as much as possible, make it obvious that we wanted this and that the fans wanted it too.  "It was something just really exciting for us to try and push forward and make it come to life. Whether it was going to happen or not and to see that it's come full circle, come to life and that people really care about it, it's just a beautiful thing."  Despite being a former Raw Women's Champion and finding success as a singles competitor on the main roster and in NXT, The Hugger admitted the mindset between tag team and singles wrestling has been a totally different game and she and Sasha have had help from some close friends to perfect their style going forward.  She said: "It's so hard. It's so so different. It's a whole different psychology and it's been a struggle to learn, but it’s been very fun.  "Sasha and I are so lucky to have The Revival on Raw with us and we're so lucky to be such good friends with them because they help us so much in understanding the why in so many things. They teach us the psychology of actually being a tag team - people don't understand that.  "When you're in a tag match like you have this tag partner and you make it known that you have this partner that you can work with. There's so many little things, we've had hundred of tag matches, but now that we are The Boss 'n' Hug Connection, we are the Women's Tag Team Champions, we have to up our game as far as these matches go.  "Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder will sit with us and watch matches with us and show us matches that we all learn from and I can't say enough good things about them, because they've helped us so much. I'm just excited to get better."  Known as one of wrestling's most lovable personalities with her caring exterior and sharing hugs with the WWE Universe, Bayley was quizzed whether we could see a more aggressive side to her personality further down the line, following the success of her four horsewomen sister Becky Lynch.  She said: "You know when Sasha makes me mad like last year, then yeah ha ha.  "It always depends on the situation and what is needed of me. There's definitely that inside of me and I think that if I didn't have that kind of fight in me then I wouldn’t have made it this far in WWE because it takes a lot out of you.  "So it's definitely there, it's just knowing when to turn it up."  Since capturing the gold, The Boss 'n' Hug Connection have made it clear that they want to create a legacy to be proud of and to be fighting champions, announcing that they'll defend their titles on all four of WWE's main brands. Started their journey together in NXT, Bayley and Sasha returned to Orlando to lay down the challenge and the former NXT Women's Champion said it felt like a homecoming.  She said: "We just returned home to NXT last week and just that was an incredible feeling, to bring those titles to where it all started for us.  "We had our first matches in that building, we had our first main event in that building. So it was very special. I can't even explain the feeling but if we were able to defend our titles with NXT, no matter where it is, in any building, that is something we really want to do.  "We're pushing for it. I don't know how to explain it, it's kind of a full circle feeling for us because we never teamed together once in NXT and we were always beating the crap out of each other, but now we're coming back as a team and we're fighting side by side.  "It's very cool and being able to help the future, which is NXT, is something that is very humbling to both of us."  With the duo returning to their roots, many fans online had started pitching ideas for the team to defend their titles in a female version of the annual Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Invitational. The friendly face admitted that it would be a honour to represent The American Dream, a man who helped shape her career, and help give back to the future of sports entertainment that is NXT.  She said: "Yeah I think that would be really cool.  "I kinda wish that we had a tournament to determine the tag titles, just so we could have more matches with different types of teams and everything like that. Like including NXT and including NXT UK.  "I think that would be such a cool thing because we were both very close, me and Sasha were very close to Dusty Rhodes and he helped so much in both our careers that like being able to pay tribute to him in that way and know that we're a part of it, it just makes it more special for everybody in the tournament.  "You're not only fighting for an opportunity but you're also fighting for Dusty and that's such a beautiful thing. Even if you didn't know him, he's someone that knows so much about the business and that you respect so I would love if something like that could happen.  "Maybe we'll just keep tweeting about it and they'll make it happen, ha ha."  While feeling her excitement of the countless possibilities they can do with the new titles, Bayley admitted that she's been impressed with the women on the NXT UK roster so far and is keeping an close eye on them after they've reminded her of herself from her early NXT days.  She said: "I think it's really cool. Obviously it's a different style, they're very aggressive and hard hitting. They all seem very strong, which is something that I admire.  "It's kinda cool to watch because NXT UK is just starting up and their brand new. You can really see the drive and the passion from these girls because this is something they’re trying to build themselves. They’re trying to build a brand which I can relate to because we did that with NXT years ago you know?  "A lot of eyes are on them but I think they embrace the pressure just like we did. I'm not actually that familiar with how many girls are doing tag teams over there, but any two together would be awesome to work with. I would love to even head on over to the Performance Center and keep our eyes on some of them."  Reflecting on how far she's seen the rise of the Women’s Evolution in WWE, Bayley took pride in the work and determination that's got the roster to where they are today. When asked to comment on the rumoured main event of WrestleMania 35 between Charlotte, Becky Lynch and Ronda Rousey, she simply said an opportunity like this has always been the division's dream.  She said: "That's been our goal this whole time. Whenever anyone's asked 'what's your goal?', four years ago, five years ago, our answer was always to main event WrestleMania.  "That is still is the answer, until it happens that is still always going to be our answer. That's everybody's answer, whether your male, female, it doesn't matter.  "So the fact that we are very close to it happening, is just like an insane feeling. I'm not going to believe it until it actually happens, but I just love seeing that we've come this far and it's actually in the conversation."<end_of_turn>

# Hill to Hall: Feb. 25–March 2 - Vanguard

A Justice Department report released by Rep. Ted Deutch, D–Florida, revealed an estimated 4,500 complaints over the course of four years about the sexual abuse of immigrant children being held in United States custody. The report came from documents from the Department of Health and Human Services with 178 of the allegations of sexual abuse allegedly perpetrated by the adult staff at detention facilities. The Office of Refugee Resettlement said the agency received “859 complaints, the largest number of reports during any five-month span in the previous four years.” President Donald Trump enacted the family separation policy in March 2018, according to The New York Times. A bill to impose statewide mandatory rent control was signed by Gov. Kate Brown on Feb. 26, following up on her previous promise to sign the bill after it passed the Oregon Senate on Feb. 12. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler endorsed the bill on Jan. 17, and the bill passed the Oregon House 35-25 earlier this week. The bill will go into effect immediately since House Democrats say the “housing crisis constitutes an emergency,” according to The Associated Press. The bill will limit landlords to raising rent once a year and no more than 7 percent above the consumer price index, though new builders are exempt from the rent control law for up to 15 years.  The Senate appointed Andrew Wheeler—a former coal lobbyist with a history of rolling back environmental regulations—as the new Environmental Protection Agency chief in a 52-47 vote. The Trump administration picked him as a replacement for Scott Pruitt, who resigned amid ethics investigations on July 5, 2018. Wheeler was acting EPA chief for the eight months after Pruitt resigned and has been criticized for both his lack of action on a large scale and his enthusiasm for repealing environmental regulations, according to The New York Times.  Nearly 18 months after the Trump administration threatened to withhold grants from areas not cooperating with immigration services—areas containing sanctuary cities—29 of 30 areas have received or are being slated to receive the grant money. Oregon is the only area not cleared for the money, according to The Register-Guard. In 2018, the State of Oregon sued former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker for the Justice Department grants. The lawsuit accused Whitaker of “impermissibly commandeering the resources of Oregon” by refusing to give money to the state.<end_of_turn>

# Heathrow Airport office evacuated over 'suspicious package'

After a suspicious package was sent to Heathrow Airport's offices, police are investigating a number of similar incidents.  London City Airport and London Waterloo train station are other high-profile public transport hubs to be impacted by the investigation.  The Compass Centre, which is an office building in the airport's complex and houses Heathrow Airport Ltd, was evacuated and police were called after the package was discovered.  Police were called to the offices on Nelson Road just before 10am on Tuesday (March 5) and evacuated the building while specialist officers responded.  A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the package was "made safe".  The spokesman said: "At approximately 9:55am police received a report of a suspicious package at The Compass Centre.  "The building was evacuated as a precaution. Specialist officers attended and the package was made safe."  Just before noon, Waterloo station was visited by specialist British Transport Police officers to reports of another suspicious package. Trains continued to run as normal, and the station was not closed.  Moments later, just after 12pm, all roads leading to London City Airport were closed , along with the DLR, after another suspicious package was reported to police.  Specialist police also visited the East London airport, but the buildings were not evacuated and flights ran without interruption, before roads and the DLR reopened.  However police say they are still investigating the incidents. A British Transport Police spokesman said it was 'too early to confirm' if the incidents are linked but that it is working closely with the Metropolitan Police.  Police are yet to reveal details on the nature of the packages or whether that had any similarities.

# 2019 NFL free agency: Some stars among top 25 defensive players available

With a draft class that is also heavy on defense at the top, we’re going to see a few teams double dip. Someone like, perhaps, the Oakland Raiders might draft a difference-making pass rusher at No. 4 overall and pair him with a key edge rusher signed in free agency. There’s enough defensive talent in free agency to make that happen. Some of the best potential free agents like Jadeveon Clowney and DeMarcus Lawrence ended up with the franchise tag (and others like Brandon Graham were signed to extensions before they could hit the market), but there’s still some good talent available. Here are the top 25 defensive players available in free agency: 1. DE Trey Flowers: Flowers will probably end up getting the biggest contract on this list. Flowers is 25, has 14 sacks the past two seasons, is good against the run and has a Patriots pedigree. Don’t be shocked when you see the numbers on Flowers’ deal, because they’re going to be enormous. He plays a prime position and due to franchise tags, the market at defensive end thinned out before it started. 2. S Landon Collins: Collins is 25 years old, a three-time Pro Bowler and the type of versatile safety who can really impact a defense. Though he hasn’t been as great the last two years, he was in the conversation for NFL defensive player of the year in 2016. You have to assume if the Giants drafted Sam Darnold last year and weren’t paying Eli Manning anymore, they’d have franchise-tagged Collins. Instead, Collins is available and he’ll be a big prize. 3. LB C.J.Mosley: It’s odd that Mosley didn’t get the franchise tag from the Ravens. He made the Pro Bowl in four of his first five NFL seasons. Inside linebackers don’t have the cache they once did, but a three-down playmaker like Mosley is still plenty valuable. 4. DT Ndamukong Suh: Suh was once one of the most coveted free agents ever, and he still has cache. Suh didn’t have a dominant season alongside Aaron Donald, but he affects the game in ways that don’t necessarily show up on the stat sheet. He’s still worth a big contract. 5. S Earl Thomas: Thomas is one of the best safeties of this generation. His unique ability allowed the Seahawks’ “Legion of Boom” to be very aggressive, knowing Thomas could cover up any mistakes. Will he still be that same player at age 30, coming off a season-ending leg injury? It’s hard to count him out. 6. S Lamarcus Joyner: Last season, Joyner got the franchise tag from the Rams, which speaks to his value. He’s a do-everything safety who is comfortable covering receivers. 7. DE Ezekiel Ansah: Ansah, once the fifth overall pick of the draft, posted 14.5 sacks in 2015. He had 12 more in 2017. Last season was a nightmare, with injuries limiting him to seven games, two starts and four sacks while he was on the franchise tag. That makes him a riskier proposition, but he still has elite athletic ability. 8. LB Anthony Barr: Barr is an interesting case. The former first-round pick looked like a future star early in his career. Though he’s made four Pro Bowls in a row, he has been good and not great. Still, he can do it all as a three-down linebacker and will get paid well as he hits his 27th birthday. 9. DT Sheldon Richardson: Richardson signed a one-year deal with the Vikings and didn’t do much to stand out. But he’s still at prime age, people remember him making a Pro Bowl with the Jets, and he can still help as an interior run defender. 10. S Tyrann Mathieu: Mathieu isn’t the same player who was once being talked about as a possible NFL defensive player of the year, as he was with the Cardinals. Some injuries have changed his ceiling as a player. But he’s still incredibly versatile and active. 11. CB Ronald Darby: Even though Darby is coming off a torn ACL, it doesn’t seem there will be much discount. Darby will be 25 next season, has good experience and despite some inconsistency, could get a prime contract. 12. DE Dante Fowler: Fowler might appear to be a disappointment so far, but the Rams traded a third- and fifth-round pick to Jacksonville for a half-season of his services. The former fourth overall pick still has value, despite just 16 sacks in 47 career games. 13. OLB Za’Darius Smith: Smith picked a good year to post a career-best 8.5 sacks for the Ravens. Smith can line up anywhere from defensive tackle to outside linebacker, and that versatility will help. 14. LB Preston Smith: Smith seems on the verge of a breakout — he had eight sacks as a rookie in 2015 and again in 2017 — but it hasn’t happened yet. He’s still a good young pass rusher and there will be a lot of interest in him. 15. S Ha Ha Clinton-Dix: It’s a little odd that safety seems to be devalued, when they can counter-act versatile spread offenses. Clinton-Dix was traded from Green Bay to Washington during last season and has been a quality player since hew was a 2014 first-round pick. It will be interesting to see how coveted he is. 16. S Eric Weddle: The Ravens decided to cut Weddle on Tuesday, saving $7.5 million on the cap. He told ESPN late last season that he would retire if the Ravens cut him, but backtracked at the Pro Bowl, saying he wanted to play in 2019. Assuming Weddle keeps playing, he’d be a nice fit for a team that needs a boost at safety in the short term. 17. CB Bryce Callahan: Years ago, a slot cornerback wouldn’t be on this list. But inside cornerbacks are nearly full-time players now and Callahan had a nice 2018 season, though he is coming off a broken foot. 18. CB Jason McCourty: McCourty will be 32 next season, a dangerous age at his position, but he’s coming off a good season with the Patriots. He was Pro Football Focus’ sixth-ranked cornerback. He won’t get a long-term deal but could be ideal for a team looking for a short-term fix. 19. S Adrian Amos: The Bears had a fantastic season on defense, and they’ll want to keep that group together. Amos had 73 tackles, two interceptions and played well alongside All-Pro safety Eddie Jackson. 20. CB Kareem Jackson: Jackson shifted to safety in 2018, had to play some cornerback due to injuries, and now enters free agency with a lot of versatility and experience. Jackson will be 31 years old but perfectly capable of posting some more good seasons. 21. LB K.J. Wright: Wright is coming off a tough season, injury-wise. He played in just five games for the Seahawks. But he has been a starter since his rookie season of 2011 and is a good off-the-ball linebacker. He will be 30 years old next season but if healthy he’s still a solid option. 22. DE Cameron Wake: Wake keeps defying age. He’ll be 37, but can still rush the passer. He posted just six sacks last season, but had 22 in the two seasons before that. Many teams are looking for pass rushers and Wake can still do that. 23. CB Pierre Desir: Desir was one of the Colts’ biggest hits in 2018. The journeyman had a breakout season at age 28, starting 12 games for a playoff team. He would fit with a zone-heavy scheme. 24. LB Kwon Alexander: Alexander led the NFL in solo tackles in 2016, made a Pro Bowl in 2017, but still has a lot of questions. He had a four-game suspension for violating the league’s PED policy in 2015. He’s coming off a torn ACL. And middle linebackers don’t fetch enormous contracts anymore. 25. LB Jordan Hicks: Hicks has been really good when he’s healthy. But he has missed 21 games over four seasons. Some team will gamble on Hicks staying healthy. – – – – – – –<end_of_turn>

# Malnutrition attributed to death of 12.5 lakh children every year in India - Star of Mysore

Focus on childhood care a must: UoM VC  Mysuru: The Vice-Chancellor of University of Mysore, Prof. G. Hemantha Kumar has urged the policy-makers and experts involved in child-care development initiatives to give more thrust to early childhood care and development as children constitute 39 per cent of population of the nation. He was speaking after inaugurating a one-day programme on Mysuru Divisional-level Consultation on Early Childhood Care and Development organised jointly by Karnataka Child Rights Observatory, Bengaluru, Human Development wing of Department of Studies in Food Science & Nutrition, University of Mysore and Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement, Mysuru, at Department of Studies in Food Science & Nutrition in Manasagangothri Campus here yesterday.  He said that 29 per cent of the population of the country are children below 5 years. Shockingly, over 1.25 million (12.5 lakh) children are dying from malnutrition, underweight related problems every year across the nation according to Government reports. Child-care experts must discuss, throw light and come up with solutions to tackle this problem, he added.  Taking cognisance of shortage of staff in Food Science and Nutrition Department, the VC said that he will fill up all posts vacant in the Department soon.  In his address, Secretary of Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement, Saragur, Dr. M.A. Balasubramanya said that UNO and UNICEF have directed all its member countries to give utmost interest for implementation of all 16 sustainable development challenges including early childhood care and development as children are the future of the world.  Apart from concentrating on poverty alleviation, health, education, agriculture and energy, gender equality and social inclusion, the world bodies have asked the governments to make concerted efforts for overall development of children and their rights, he said.  Dr. Balasubramanya said that health and education activities of the children of 466 Jenu Kuruba families of H.D.Kote taluk had improved a lot after health, hygiene and sanitation facilities were given by his NGO. Malnutrition and underweight problems of Jenu Kuruba children were addressed by providing milk and eggs apart from regular food.  The governments at the Centre and State must also give top priority for health and sanitation issues of children apart from implementing Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) effectively to bring down child mortality rate in the country.  Prosun Sen, Communication Advocacy and Partnership Specialist, UNICEF Office for Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, asked the implementing agencies to ensure quality food to children and pregnant women through ICDS programme, Anganwadis and Balawadis to address malnutrition related deaths and problems in the country. Over 70 delegates from various Universities, Department of Women and Child Development, ICDS and NGOs involved in the districts of Mysuru Division including Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar and Kodagu took part in the event.  Organising Chairperson Prof. Asna Urooj and Trustee of Child Rights Trust, Bengaluru, Dr. Padmini were present.<end_of_turn>

# Stateless former child slave in indefinite detention in Australia

During his sometimes unbelievable and often tragic life, he's been kept as a slave, people have wanted to kill him and, at all times, he's been a man without a country. The man, known as M47 - a pseudonym he was given by a court - doesn't know his parents, his age or even where he was born. His mother died when he was about six years old and he was sent to an orphanage in the Canary Islands, but ran away. He wound up in Belgium, where he met a man who made him a house slave for about two years. When a door was left unlocked one day he escaped and fled to Holland, where he was picked up by a gang and trafficked around Europe. Fearing for his life if he didn't do the gang's bidding, he fled for New Zealand but never made it out of Australia. M47 believes he comes from the disputed territory of Western Sahara in north-west Africa, but he can't be sure. The director of Human Rights for All, Alison Battisson, is a lawyer who acted for M47 in a recent, unsuccessful court bid to get him freedom. "He certainly has had a lot of hardship in his life. He is definitely a survivor and he's certainly very flexible in being able to respond to very difficult situations. "But really, what it comes down to is he is an example of someone who is stateless and has experienced extreme statelessness." Despite what he's been through, Ms Battisson said M47 is a quite extraordinary person. "He is a delightful gentleman. He's incredibly generous, he's very intelligent, he's very funny, he would do anything for anyone. And all he really wants to do is to get out of detention and start a new life. "He is an extraordinary linguist. So despite the fact he's had a very difficult background - or in fact perhaps because of it - he has had to learn 10 to 12 languages." According to an Australian High Court document filed in November, the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship was to meet with officials at the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra in November and raise the possibility of M47's resettlement in New Zealand. Immigration New Zealand confirmed to RNZ that it had received a request for resettlement of a person being detained in Australia but after some consideration declined it. Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition, said it was an "appalling" case that highlighted everything that's wrong with Australia's immigration detention system. "It is a direct result of mandatory detention. You've got an absurd situation where the law says that this person can be held in immigration detention even though the Australian Government has got nowhere to return this person to." He said instances of statelessness were far more common than you might think. "Very often you find situations when there are clearly stateless people: Feyli Kurds, for example, the Bidoon of Kuwait. Very often Palestinians find themselves stateless because they can't be returned through Israel - Israel of course won't accept Palestinians." Mr Rintoul said M47's case demonstrated why the New Zealand government should take a stronger stand against Australia's policies on immigration detention. It comes as immigration prisoners across Australia - many of whom are New Zealanders - engage in hunger strikes to protest their apparently indefinite detention. Matthew Theunissen<end_of_turn>

# View Sidney Holden's Obituary on stltoday.com and share memories

Holden, Sidney Kinyon World War II Navy Veteran and long time executive in the Land Title Industry died peacefully on Saturday March 2, 2019 in Strongsville Ohio.

# New Fortress Energy signs contract to supply natural gas to PREPA

New Fortress Energy LLC announced that its Puerto Rico subsidiary, NFEnerg√≠a LLC, has entered into a contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority for the supply of natural gas and conversion of Units 5 and 6 of the San Juan Combined Cycle Power Plant.  The initial term of the contract is five years, with options for PREPA to extend for three additional five-year periods.  PREPA estimates that the conversion of these units from diesel to natural gas will generate an estimated $750 million in fuel cost savings over five years for the public power utility and significantly reduce emissions.  ‚ÄúThis is a very pivotal transaction for PREPA and Puerto Rico,‚Äù said Wes Edens, CEO of New Fortress.  ‚ÄúThe conversion of San Juan Units 5 and 6 to natural gas will save hundreds of millions of dollars and accelerate the modernization of critical power infrastructure,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúNatural gas power is cleaner, cheaper and is the perfect complement to renewable energy. New Fortress is proud to invest in the security and sustainability of Puerto Rico‚Äôs clean and renewable energy future,‚Äù he added.  After multiple conversion attempts over the past 10 years, PREPA launched a competitive request for proposal bid process (RFP #81412) in July 2018 for the supply of fuel and the conversion of San Juan Power Plant‚Äôs Units 5 and 6.  NFEnerg√≠a‚Äôs bid was selected based on fourteen grading criteria, which included experience and capacity, approach and methodology, and price.  ‚ÄúFor the first time, this infrastructure project will successfully bring natural gas to the north of Puerto Rico, achieving one of the strategic objectives of the Island‚Äôs energy sector. It also provides substantial savings to our customers and reduces carbon dioxide (CO2 emissions), which impact the environment and climate change”, said PREPA CEO Jos√© Ortiz.  ‚ÄúThe contract has been approved by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau and the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico,‚Äù he said.  NFEnerg√≠a will supply natural gas to the power plant from its micro fuel handling facility in the Port of San Juan, which has been under development for more than a year. The facility is being constructed with multiple truck loading bays to provide liquefied natural gas to on-island industrial customers and microgrids.  The conversion of San Juan Units 5 and 6 and the development of the micro fuel handling facility are anticipated to be complete by mid-2019.<end_of_turn>

# GOP senators blast House probe as politics, not fact-finding mission

OAN Newsroom 
UPDATED 6:21 AM PT — Wednesday, March 6, 2019 UPDATED 6:21 AM PT — Wednesday, March 6, 2019 
 Senate Republicans are blasting House Democrats for “playing politics” by looking into President Trump’s administrative and personal life.  On Tuesday, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy accused the House Judiciary Committee’s probe of being politically motivated. He said it’s not a fact-finding mission.  Kennedy also said the move sells the American people short, because lawmakers are now wrapped up in endless investigations instead of working with Republicans to pass meaningful legislation.  That sentiment was also echoed by Texas Senator John Cornyn.  “You know this is their plan all along — it’s basically going to preclude our ability to pass any kind of bipartisan legislation, because they’re just sucking up all the oxygen,” he stated. “We’ve got investigations in both Houses and the Intelligence Committee, still working on the Intelligence Committee investigation in the Senate and, so far, there’s been really not much to show for it — no evidence of collusion and our Democratic colleagues can’t stand it.”  Cornyn believes the Democrats ultimate goal for the investigation is to set the stage for impeachment proceedings.<end_of_turn>

# New calculator predicts risk of breast cancer returning...what's YOUR risk?

A NEW online ‘risk’ calculator can now be used by doctors to assess whether a patient’s breast cancer is likely to return.  Medics can log on and use the tool, developed by UK scientists, to decide whether a woman should continue treatment.  High risk patients could be given extended hormone therapy. But women with a low risk could receive less treatment - and hopefully, suffer less adverse side effects.  It’s called CT55 and was developed by experts at Queen Mary University London and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. It’s available to doctors from Friday. It’s suitable for assessing women who are five years post diagnosis. Professor Jack Cuzick, from Queen Mary University of London, said: “Hormone sensitive breast cancer is one of the few cancers where late recurrence is common, and predicting who is at high risk is particularly important so that they can continue treatment.  “We are providing a simple tool, which is available now, and is easily used and well-tested.”  Professor Mitch Dowsett, Head of the Royal Marsden Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research, said: “What we have developed could improve clinical practice, benefiting cancer patients by avoiding potentially unnecessary extended treatment.  It will help clinicians make crucial decisions for patients, decisions that can make a difference to quality of life.” MOST READ IN HEALTH NEWS Currently, breast cancer kills over 11,000 women a year in the UK, but 55,000 women are diagnosed. One in eight women are diagnosed during their lifetime.  Rates are expected to rise by two per cent between 2014 and 2035.  GOT a story?

# Dell Latitude 2100 review

After the success of its Inspiron Mini netbooks, Dell has aimed its next release at the education market. Sold under Dell's corporate Latitude brand, the 2100 is a tough and usable netbook with a range of unique features. Available in a choice of colours, the textured rubber casing prevents scratches and makes it easy to hold. The chassis is quite bulky, but removable handles and shoulder straps can be added to allow easier transportation. Battery life is average, however, at just 191 minutes. The 10.1-inch screen uses a matt-TFT finish to reduce reflections, making it ideal for use in the classroom. Images are bright and sharp, but lack the vibrancy of glossy Super-TFT screens. A webcam is integrated into the screen panel. The keyboard spans the full width of the chassis. All keys are firmly mounted and respond with an accurate, yet slightly spongy action. Interactive touchscreen functionality can also be added for £14. While our review unit featured a 160GB hard drive, the HDD can be configured up to 250GB or users can opt for up to 16GB of SSD storage. A 3-in-1 card reader is fitted, and an external USB DVD rewriter is also available to buy as an optional extra. Performance is standard netbook fare, thanks to the Intel Atom N270 processor, and is more than capable for school use and basic office tasks. Dell offers a choice of Windows XP and Vista operating systems at the time of purchase. Three USB ports and a VGA-out port are in place. 802.11g Wi-Fi, Gigabit Ethernet and Bluetooth are also included as standard. 802.11n Wi-Fi is available as an additional extra and a network activity light on the screen lid alerts teachers to students browsing the internet during class. With great usability and features, the Latitude 2100 is an unusual, yet highly usable, netbook. Overall, it has just as much to offer to consumer and business users as it does to students.<end_of_turn>

# France and Iran upgrade diplomatic status despite mutual suspicions

In return, Iran may appoint Bahram Ghassémi, the current spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, according to Iran’s Mehr News Agency, quoting “unconfirmed reports.”  The rebirth of Franco- Iranian ties comes after a difficult period of mutual distrust.  In June last year, European security services arrested four people suspected of planning an terror attack on a yearly gathering of the National Council of Resistance, an opposition group, at a conference center in Villepinte, just outside Paris.  The suspects, two Belgian nationals of Iranian origin, a French Iranian and an Iranian diplomat are currently under detention in Antwerp, awaiting trial.  In October, France security services said it was ‘likely’ that Iran was behind the bombing attempt, and expelled Iranian embassy personnel.  Assissination Accusations  At the same time, The Netherlands and Denmark expelled diplomats after suspected assassination attempts on Iranian citizens on their soil, allegedly orchestrated by Tehran.  Just this week, Iran expelled two Dutch diplomats, and Holland retaliated by recalling its ambassador ‘for consultations.’  The accusations against Iran have put the EU in a difficult position, as the UK, France and Germany, as three of the six members of the “P5 +1” (five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) try to salvage the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.  Deal in jeopardy  The deal is in jeopardy after US President Donald Trump unilaterally walked away from the deal, saying it didn’t offer enough guarantees that Iran wouldn't develop an atomic weapon.  The EU partners of the deal said they would remain committed to the deal, and late last year started to develop plans for a non-US Dollar “mechanism” that EU countries could use to circumvent US sanctions while continue to do business with Iran.  Ironically, on January 8, the EU also imposed new sanctions on Iran, singling out the Iranian Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS) and two individuals. The sanctions were proposed by The Netherlands, together with the UK, France, Germany, Denmark and Belgium als “expressed their grave concern” with the Iranian authorities about “probable involvement in hostile activities on European soil,” but also stress that the sanctions are in no way connected to Brussels’ attempts to continue trade relations with Tehran.  Washington has condemned the European trade mechanism, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying he was “disturbed and disappointed” by it.<end_of_turn>

# White Rock business forced to move after city’s iconic pier destroyed - Cloverdale Reporter

After a windstorm damaged White Rock’s iconic pier in December, many speculated that the loss of the popular tourist attraction would have a ripple effect on waterfront businesses.  Although nobody can be certain of the actual impact until summer, there’s at least one business that has been directly affected by the temporary loss of the structure.  White Rock Sea Tours and Whale Watching has operated off the south end of the pier for a number of years. With the loss of the space and dock that was used to launch sea tours, owner Andrew Newman has been forced to relocate his business for the upcoming season.  Newman told Peace Arch News Tuesday that he’s in the process of opening office space at the Crescent Beach Marina (12555 Crescent Rd.).  Although there are positives to the new space, such as conveniently located customer parking, nearby washrooms and the marina store, he’s expecting to lose some potential clients.  “That’s going to sting me this year, for sure,” Newman said. “We don’t have the walk-up traffic here at Crescent Beach Marina that you would at the pier. I would say that was maybe 15 to 20 per cent of the business, maybe more,” Newman said.  Newman said he’s been working with White Rock director of recreation and culture Eric Stepura to make the transition more seamless, but Newman expressed concern with how long he expects the pier will take to rebuild.  The City of White Rock anticipates that the pier will reopen by late August.  “The bureaucratic processes that they have to go through are slow and cumbersome, it seems. That’s where people get frustrated in the community, because it takes too long to move things along, or there’s not an established timeline and plan that gets published,” Newman said.  “They say August, but then nobody sees anything happening, nobody hears anything then they start to speculate.”  Last month, city council approved $5.4 million for immediate repairs to the pier and other costs related to the windstorm.<end_of_turn>

# Tesla enters into agreement with Chinese lenders for Gigafactory

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Thursday it signed an agreement with lenders in China for a 12-month facility of up to 3.5 billion yuan ($521 million) for the electric carmaker’s Gigafactory in Shanghai, and secured new commitments from banks that could be used for investments in the United States and elsewhere. The company broke ground on the factory in January. A Shanghai city government official said on Wednesday the factory is expected to be completed in May. Tesla has said that the Gigafactory will cost around $2 billion. In its filing, Tesla said it had amended its asset-backed lending credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, increasing revolving commitments by $500 million to a total of $2.425 billion, while extending the maturity date of the agreement by three years. The credit agreement is secured by part of Tesla’s accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Tesla borrowed $431.0 million under the agreement in 2018. The amendment also doubled the letter of credit subfacility to $400 million from $200 million. Producing cars in China is likely to help the company minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, which has forced Tesla to adjust prices of its U.S.-made cars in China. Keeping prices in check will also help Tesla fend off competition from a swathe of domestic electric vehicle startups such as Nio Inc, Byton and XPeng Motors.

# #TBT: Alessandra Ferri and Mikhail Baryshnikov as Giselle and Albrecht in "Dancers" (1987)

Alessandra Ferri and Mikhail Baryshnikov are two dancers whose physicality and artistic prowess truly pushed ballet to a new level. Their careers have spanned decades and continents, making them icons of the ballet world. In the late 1980s both dancers were working at American Ballet Theatre, Ferri as a principal dancer and Baryshnikov as artistic director and performer, when they co-starred in the 1987 film Dancers, a drama centered around a ballet company that included a staged production of Giselle. This clip from the film shows Ferri and Baryshnikov as Giselle and Albrecht in the last moments of the ballet, highlighting their dramatic chops with up-close camera angles. Alessandra Ferri and Mikhail Baryshnikov - Last dance of Giselle and Albrecht www.youtube.com Music mounting in intensity, Albrecht enters for the final coda on the verge of collapse. When Myrtha commands him to continue dancing, Baryshnikov uses his head to throw his entire body into his jumps. Twisting in a suspended relevé at 0:30, he reaches out for Giselle. Ferri enters, an ethereal vision with her long pale arms and dark features shrouded in white tulle. She floats across the stage with Baryshnikov supporting her, as her famously supple feet scoop off the ground. The two tour jeté wildly back and forth, using their back legs to bolster themselves higher into the air. The changing camera angles give an artistic perspective to the ballet's heartrending finale; from the back of the stage we see Ferri and Baryshnikov trapped between the ranks of willis, while filmed from up close, we see their sweat, pumping chests, and the delicate details of their hands and eyes. Happy #ThrowbackThursday!<end_of_turn>

# Statue of Polish priest dismantled following sex abuse allegations - Independent.ie

Statue of Polish priest dismantled following sex abuse allegations  Councillors in the Gdansk voted for the metal figure of Solidarity-era priest Henryk Jankowski to be removed following allegations he abused minors.  Workers in the Polish city of Gdansk have dismantled a statue of the late Solidarity-era priest Henryk Jankowski following allegations he sexually abused youngsters.  Councillors in the city voted on Thursday to have the statue removed, and to have the name of the square where it stood — named after Jankowski — changed.  They also want Jankowski stripped of the Baltic city’s honorary citizenship. The city mayor has also spoken in favour of the monument’s removal.  A crane took the metal figure off its stone base on Friday before a truck drove it away to a storage place.  Jankowski’s critics are calling for the allegations to be examined.  The statue was funded in 2012 to recognise Jankowski’s staunch support for the Solidarity pro-democracy movement in the 1980s, borne out of a strike at the Gdansk shipyard.  Questions over Jankowski resurfaced last year when at least two people alleged to Polish media that they were abused as youngsters.  A previous investigation into allegations that Jankowski sexually abused young boys was stopped in 2003.  Protesters who wanted to draw attention to the abuse allegations in strongly-Catholic Poland toppled the statue last month, cushioning its fall with car tyres. Shipyard workers had put it back up.  The controversy takes place as the Vatican seeks to contain damage caused by an array of sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church.  Jankowski, who died in 2010, gained prominence through his support for the nationwide Solidarity movement and its leader, Lech Walesa, in their struggle against Poland’s communist regime.  World leaders, including former president George HW Bush and then UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher, visited Jankowski’s St Brygida Church in Gdansk in recognition of his anti-communist activity.

# All-female Legal Group Fights for Women, Girls in Sierra Leone - New Delhi Times - India's Only International Newspaper

In Sierra Leone, cases involving the abuse of women have rarely been prosecuted. Spousal abusers, child abusers and even rapists have, too often, walked free.  A group of lawyers and judges — all of them female — has decided to take action to change that.  “We’ve seen a lot of issues affecting our women and girls in our society, and we believe that, with the expertise that we have, we can make a difference by rendering services to the women and children who need it most,” said Fatmata Sorie, an attorney and president of the group Legal Access through Women Yearning for Equality Rights and Social justice (LAWYERS).  The group was founded 22 years ago and offers pro bono legal work to those in need. One of the founding members was Patricia Kabbah, a former first lady of Sierra Leone and a lawyer herself.  LAWYERS has about 50 members, and Sorie says they discourage out-of-court settlements in rape cases, preferring to prosecute attackers to the full extent of the law. They also prosecute accessories to the crime. The group conducts outreach to families, encouraging people to break their silence about sexual violence.  “We also start within our homes because, in most homes, we don’t sit down as parents, as families, to discuss issues,” she said. “So most of the time the children, the women, are not aware of the signs and symptoms. They’re not aware of anything until it had fully happened, so the conversation has to start from the bottom up.”  In an unprecedented move, President Julius Maada Bio in February declared rape and sexual violence a national emergency. The country had more than 8,500 reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence last year, but observers believe thousands of additional cases go unreported.  According to the Rainbo Initiative, a Sierra Leonean organization that helps survivors of gender-based violence, 93 percent of victims treated are younger than 17 years of age, and 24 percent are younger than 11.  The presidential declaration is already having an effect.  “We believe the most prominent impact so far is that we will have more numbers coming out because people feel more comfortable coming up to report these cases,” Sorie said. “And we also have a situation where the regulations are passed based on the declaration that was made by the president. The process for prosecuting sexual penetration and rape cases would be much shorter based on the instruction and the directives.”  The president also created a special police division to handle rape cases. But Sorie believes there is more work to be done. She would like to see the maximum penalty for rape increased to life in prison from the current limit of 15 years and wants stronger witness-protection programs. She also said the nation needs additional medical facilities to treat rape victims and forensics labs to test DNA samples.  “We need to keep the fight going and to curb this menace within our society,” she said.

# Taking a nap is 'as good as pills for reducing blood pressure'

An afternoon nap is as good as taking tablets for reducing blood pressure, according to a new study.  Putting your feet up for a midday kip was on par with taking blood pressure pills, reducing salt in your diet or cutting down on drinking. Overall, taking a nap during the day was associated with an average 5mm Hg drop in blood pressure.  And for every extra hour of shuteye you get, the more your blood pressure drops.  Cardiologists found for every 60 minutes of midday sleep, 24-hour average systolic blood pressure decreased by 3 mm Hg. The new findings add to the benefits of an afternoon snooze which include boosting energy levels and moods.  If untreated high blood pressure increases the risk of both heart attack and stroke.  Although it falls outside the scope of the study, Greek researchers said one could speculate that along with the heart-healthy Mediterranean diet, the cultural acceptance of midday napping may also play a role in the healthier profile seen in these populations.  Co-author cardiologist Dr Manolis Kallistratos at the Asklepieion General Hospital in Greece, said: ‘Midday sleep appears to lower blood pressure levels at the same magnitude as other lifestyle changes.  ‘For example, salt and alcohol reduction can bring blood pressure levels down by 3 to 5 mm Hg.’  A low-dose antihypertensive medication usually lowers blood pressure levels by 5 to 7 mm Hg, on average, Dr Kallistratos said.    He added: “These findings are important because a drop in blood pressure as small as 2 mm Hg can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack by up to 10 percent  ‘Based on our findings, if someone has the luxury to take a nap during the day, it may also have benefits for high blood pressure.  ‘Napping can be easily adopted and typically doesn’t cost anything.’  The study was the first study to prospectively assess midday sleep’s affect on blood pressure levels among people whose blood pressure is reasonably controlled, according to the researchers. 
Previous research found midday naps was associated with reduced blood pressure levels and fewer antihypertensive medications being prescribed among people with very high blood pressure readings. Dr Kallistratos said: ‘The higher the blood pressure levels, the more pronounced any effort to lower it will appear.  ‘By including people with relatively well-controlled blood pressure, we can feel more confident that any significant differences in blood pressure readings are likely due to napping.’  The findings were based on a study of 212 people with an average age of 62 and over half were women. They had a mean blood pressure of 129.9 mm Hg and about a quarter were smokers and/or had Type 2 diabetes. The groups were similar in terms of risk factors for heart disease except there were more smokers in the napping group.  Their blood pressure was recorded for 24 hours consecutively in ‘real life’ while the midday sleep was on average 49 minutes long. The scientists also assessed lifestyle habits for example, alcohol, coffee and salt consumption, physical activity levels, and pulse wave velocity, a measure of stiffness in the arteries.  At the start the patients also underwent an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the heart that shows its structure and function. In their analyses, researchers adjusted for factors known to influence blood pressure levels, including age, gender, lifestyle and medications.  There were no differences in terms of the number of antihypertensive medications taken between the two groups, and pulse wave velocity tests and echocardiograms were also similar.  Overall, average 24-hour systolic blood pressure was 5.3 mm Hg lower among those who napped compared with those who didn’t (127.6 mm Hg vs 132.9 mm Hg). When looking at both blood pressure numbers, people who slept during the day had more favourable readings (128.7/76.2 vs 134.5/79.5 mm Hg). There also appeared to be a direct linear relationship between time asleep and blood pressure.  As reported, for each hour of napping, the average 24-hour systolic blood pressure lowered by 3 mm Hg.  Dr Kallistratos added: ‘We obviously don’t want to encourage people to sleep for hours on end during the day, but on the other hand, they shouldn’t feel guilty if they can take a short nap, given the potential health benefits.  ‘Even though both groups were receiving the same number of medications and blood pressure was well controlled, there was still a significant decrease in blood pressure among those who slept during midday.’  The findings are further bolstered because patients had similar dipping blood pressure rates at night (natural drops during nighttime sleep). This meant any reductions in ambulatory blood pressure were separate from this phenomenon and give greater confidence that reductions in ambulatory blood pressure could be due to daytime napping.  The findings are due to be presented at the American College of Cardiology’s annual conference in New Orleans later this month.<end_of_turn>

Chimwemwe Nyirenda has resigned as MultiChoice Malawi’s marketing manager after working for the DStv service provider for 12 years in order to concentrate on his own marketing firm, Hashtag Communications. A statement from MultiChoice acknowledges that Nyirenda “was an instrumental manager to the DStv marketing team for the past 12 years and was the driving force behind the launching of the GOtv Malawi brand in 2013, putting in place all the structure, people and processes necessary for the success of MultiChoice Malawi business.  “Chimwemwe has always been a team player and an extraordinary employee, the entire team at MultiChoice Malawi recognize Chimwemwe for his courtesy and amicability  “Chimwemwe’s leadership and innovation have kept us ahead of our competitors.

Nevertheless we wish him the very best in his next endeavors,” said the press release issued by Khaira Surtee, MultiChoice’s PR & communication manager.  Under the motto ‘Great Minds Think Alike’, Hashtag Communications was formed and is being managed by Malawians with great and vast experience with great understanding of the Malawi market and whole media landscape.  It boasts of staff with over 20 years of experience in commercial and social marketing, as according to its flier posted on social media.  “Malawi’s media market is saturated with over 80 radio and television stations, over 20 online publications which makes it harder to select the right media channel, at the right time. The Malawi market is changing everyday hence the need to change the way we do things.  “The media landscape in Malawi has become more complex. Not all Malawians ‘support same team’, everyone has his or her own needs and consume media differently,” says the company, situated in Pamodzi Park, second floor, room 18 & 19 at Ginnery Corner. Just last Saturday, Nyirenda was voted as executive committee member for the Super League of Malawi (SULOM) during its elective annual general meeting (AGM) which is now headed by its former treasurer, Tiya Somba Banda, who went in unopposed.

# Memorial stone for former synagogue vandalized in France | WTOP

PARIS (AP) — French police are investigating after a memorial stone marking the site of a former synagogue destroyed by the Nazis was vandalized in the eastern city of Strasbourg.  The prefecture of the Bas-Rhin region said in a statement the heavy memorial stone was discovered moved from its base Saturday morning.  Strasbourg mayor Roland Ries denounced “a new anti-Semitic act.” “Anti-Semitism undermines the values of the Republic”, the prefecture said.  The monument commemorates a synagogue built in 1898 that was set on fire and razed to the ground by the Nazis in 1940.  The incident comes amid an uptick in anti-Semitic acts in France in recent months. Last month, about 80 gravestones were spray-painted with swastikas in a Jewish cemetery close to Strasbourg.

# What to Know About Tinnitus

Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site.  Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site.  You may have experienced ringing in your ears after a loud concert or being exposed to the head-splitting sounds of a jackhammer.  This phenomenon—acute tinnitus—usually fades away after a couple of days.  But imagine that ringing, or a similarly annoying noise, lasting for a prolonged period of time, waxing and waning but never disappearing completely, and sometimes getting worse.  This can be the experience of someone with chronic tinnitus, a perception of ringing (or buzzing) in the ears. Twenty-seven percent of the more than 122,000 members who responded to a recent Consumer Reports survey on hearing and hearing loss report having this unpleasant condition.  According to other research, 20 percent of people with it have symptoms so severe that they experience trouble sleeping, difficulty hearing and concentrating, social isolation, depression and anxiety, and stress.  The most common cause of chronic tinnitus is age-related hearing loss—which occurs naturally over the years. “When the hair cells inside your inner ear are damaged, it likely impairs the normal mechanisms of the brain, almost like a short circuit, which causes the ringing,” explains Marc Bennett, M.D., an associate professor of otology and neuro-otology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  But exposure to loud noise can lead to tinnitus, according to the National Institutes of Health. And increasingly, younger people are at risk for both hearing loss—likely often due to listening to personal audio devices on high volume, says Bennett—and tinnitus. In fact, one study published in Scientific Reports in 2016 found that almost 30 percent of adolescents had chronic tinnitus.  Other causes include Meniere’s disease (an inner ear disorder caused by abnormal ear pressure), benign ear tumors, and medications such as the antibiotic erythromycin or chemotherapy treatments. With medication-related tinnitus, the effect is transient and will usually go away when the drugs are stopped. In rare cases, pulsatile tinnitus—a ringing or pulsing that occurs at the same rate as your heart—can crop up in those with heart disease.  Here, what you need to know about how to help prevent tinnitus and what to do if it strikes.  Safeguard Your Ears, Prevent Tinnitus  The most effective way to prevent tinnitus—whether acute or chronic—is to protect your hearing, says Catherine Palmer, Ph.D., associate professor in the departments of communication science and disorders and otolaryngology at the University of Pittsburgh.  That means shielding your ears from loud noises. You might know that it's important to wear earplugs or protective headphones when using noisy power tools outside. But do the same during loud social activities (for example, a noisy concert or football game) and pay attention to other activities during which you may be exposed to loud sounds.  That's because even temporary tinnitus is a sign that you’ve done some damage to your hearing, and over time, this can add up, Palmer explains.  Any noise over 85 decibels can damage hearing, depending on how loud it is and how long you're exposed. A sporting event, for example, can be around 100 decibels and may do some harm to your hearing after 15 minutes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Listening to music on your tablet at maximum volume can expose you to 105 to 110 decibels and begin to affect your hearing within 5 minutes. (You can find other common noise levels here.)  If You Think You Have Tinnitus  If you experience a ringing or buzzing in your ears that lasts longer than a day or two (or seems to crop up without exposure to loud sounds), see an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT).  He or she will examine your head, ears, and neck to rule out causes like Meniere’s disease, then send you to an audiologist to have your hearing checked. In some cases, the cause may be unclear and your healthcare provider will rely on your health history and exam findings for a diagnosis, notes Rachel Georgopoulos, M.D., an ENT at the Cleveland Clinic.  Whether the tinnitus will resolve or linger is hard to predict, Palmer says. "After multiple exposures (to loud noise), it is common that the tinnitus becomes chronic and does not go away, and may worsen," she adds.  If the ringing becomes chronic and bothersome, simple lifestyle tweaks may help. Make sure you get enough sleep and limit stress, our experts say. And you may notice an improvement simply by cutting back on caffeine—which can worsen anxiety—says Bennett. “When you’re anxious, you’re more likely to notice and be bothered by tinnitus,” he adds.  Some research suggests that relaxation therapies such as meditation or yoga can help: A small study published last year in the International Archives of Otorhinolaryngology, for example, found that people who attended a weekly yoga class and practiced poses at home for three months reported significant improvements in their symptoms.  But if after these measures tinnitus is still interfering with your daily life, consider the following options:  Hearing aids. More than half of people with tinnitus also report hearing loss, according to the American Academy of Audiology. When you have both, hearing aids, along with lifestyle measures, are the first line of treatment, Palmer says.  By making sounds in your environment more audible, aids may essentially distract you from the tinnitus—keeping your "hearing" nerves busy processing outside noises.  Some hearing aids even produce a continuous low-level sound that is said to make tinnitus noise less obtrusive and annoying. But a 2018 Cochrane review found these work no better at relieving symptoms than a regular hearing aid.  Cognitive behavior therapy. This talk therapy may help you cope better with your condition and has the strongest evidence behind it. CBT can be used used for a variety of issues—from sleep to depression—but for tinnitus, it's usually conducted by both a psychologist and an audiologist.  “It teaches you how to manage the stress of it and strategies to ignore it so that you’re less bothered by it,” Bennett says. A type of CBT known as Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), which combines mindfulness techniques such as meditation with CBT, significantly reduced symptoms and anxiety in about half of all patients, according to a study published last March in the journal Ear and Hearing. Insurance coverage may vary.  Tinnitus retraining therapy (TNT). This therapy, usually conducted by an audiologist, involves retraining your brain to accept the ringing sounds of tinnitus as normal, rather than bothersome, until you become completely unaware of them. It’s effective, but treatment can take months or years. And in addition to counseling, you’ll need to wear a device that generates low-level noise all the time. Almost 75 percent of people with tinnitus reported significant relief after 18 months of TNT, according to a 2017 study published in Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology. It’s often not covered by insurance.  Antidepressants. A study published in 2015 in the International Journal of Laryngology found that about 80 percent of chronic tinnitus sufferers experienced anxiety, 59 percent had depression, and about 58 percent had both. Antidepressants won’t treat your tinnitus, but they will improve your mood, making it easier for you to cope, Bennett says.  Therapies to question: People with very severe tinnitus are often—understandably—desperate for a cure, Palmer says. But much of what’s touted online is really snake oil, she notes. Supplements such as gingko biloba or melatonin, for example, have been said to treat tinnitus, but there’s no solid research behind them.  The same is true for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, where an electromagnetic coil placed against your scalp delivers a magnetic pulse that's said to stimulate nerve cells in the brain.  You’re better off exploring one or more of the evidence-based therapies above, say experts. And if one doesn’t help, work with your audiologist and your ENT to find another. “There is no cure for tinnitus, but there are ways to manage it that are successful for many people,” Palmer says.  And know that waiting it out may also offer some benefit. Over time, “people tend to become less and less bothered by it,” explains Georgopoulos.

# Oilers need to go back to drawing board and build around McDavid, Draisaitl | The Star

The dumpster fire seems to be under control in Edmonton. Columbus, in total disarray after sacrificing a massive chunk of the future in a reckless attempt to win a Stanley Cup this spring, has moved past the Oilers and become the NHL franchise most similar to a three-alarm blaze at the moment. For a while there, it looked like the firing of general manager Peter Chiarelli had created an even uglier situation with the Oilers than what Chiarelli had created. Connor McDavid had taken on a nightly look that made you constantly wonder if he was about to burst into tears. The trade deadline passed without interim general manager Keith Gretzky doing anything crazy, like hastily dumping the disappointing Jesse Puljujarvi, but a one-sided 6-2 loss in Toronto last week seemed to signal the Oilers were still capable of new horrors before they could put a wrap on the 2018-19 season. Late in that loss to the Leafs, however, the Oilers looked like they stopped being embarrassed and started to get a little mad. Edmonton winger Brad Malone injured Travis Dermott with a dangerous hit from behind into the side boards and got away with it, both on the ice and with no discipline afterward from NHL hanging judge George Parros, surely the most clueless individual to hold that post since Gil Stein was giving suspensions for non-game days. Later in the third period, with Toronto up 6-1, Zack Kassian ran over Freddie Andersen in the Leafs crease, allowing Ryan Nugent-Hopkins to put the puck in the net. Everyone was so bored by the one-sided game, including the yawning referees and NHL ops people, apparently, that they called it a goal just so the game would be over more quickly. But the Oilers got a reward for somebody, in this case Kassian, showing a little life. The Oilers went out the next night and beat the Belleville Senators, who Eugene Melnyk dressed up as his NHL squad that night, and since then things have started looking up a little bit for Edmonton. Triumphs over that imploding Blue Jackets team, the mediocre Sabres and then Vancouver have at least temporarily turned down the heat on the organization. The team’s playoff hopes are still dim, and maybe that’s OK, as another lottery pick would probably help this club more at this stage. Gretzky, brother of No. 99, has quieted things down. It’s clear there are going to be many choices for president Bob Nicholson when it comes to hiring a new GM, and Gretzky probably deserves some consideration. This is going to be a massive hire for Nicholson, who doesn’t have a lot of success on his resumé since joining the Oilers in 2014. He’s already made it clear that this time, after quickly deciding on Chiarelli the last time Edmonton needed a GM, he’s going to interview a lot of candidates. The challenge for Nicholson is going to be whether he’s more inclined to listen to somebody who sells him on a way to turn this situation around quickly, or whether he realizes the Oilers are a poorly built team that requires major surgery and a new team philosophy and therefore might go backward before it can move forward again. In that light, this recent improvement may not be helpful to Nicholson. It may get too many folks thinking this club can be quickly altered to get the Oilers to contending status. Already, for example, you’ve got some suggesting perhaps Kassian could be McDavid’s permanent winger because he’s scored a few goals lately. Oh my. Look, McDavid is the fastest player in the NHL, and somehow the Oilers are one of the league’s slowest, least mobile teams. They are swimming against the current of what wins in today’s NHL. That has to change immediately. So McDavid, obviously, and Leon Draisaitl can stay. Darnell Nurse hasn’t played 300 NHL games yet and it’s always a mistake to make a decision on a talented young defenceman until at least that point in his career. Otherwise, the rest of this team can be exchanged for an entirely different type of team, probably smaller and definitely faster. They’ll need a coach — perhaps Sheldon Keefe — who thinks that way too, and they’ll need to clear up their payroll situation. Milan Lucic, with four years left on his deal at $6 million per season, would be a perfect fit in Ottawa next season to help get the low-budget Senators to the salary-cap floor. Gretzky should have been on the phone to Pierre Dorion yesterday asking what it would take to make that happen. This isn’t a total tear down because the Oilers have McDavid and Draisaitl, but it’s close. There’s a cinder-block foundation, and that’s it. The executive who comes in telling Nicholson those cold, hard facts is the person who should get the job, not the one who comes in talking playoffs in 2020. The dumpster fire may be under control now, but it’ll flare up again unless the Oilers realize this team needs a total redesign, not a little sprucing up.

# Debut Trade: Arvind Fashions hits upper circuit after listing at Rs 591

Amidst much confusion about its price, Arvind Fashions Ltd (AFL), the demerged entity of textile major Arvind Ltd, on Friday listed on the stock exchanges at Rs 591. By Chirag Madia & Rakshita Sareen Amidst much confusion about its price, Arvind Fashions Ltd (AFL), the demerged entity of textile major Arvind Ltd, on Friday listed on the stock exchanges at Rs 591. The confusion resulted from the base price of Rs 311, fixed by the exchanges, for trading. Market participants felt the price should have been in the range of Rs 1,200-Rs 1,500 per share. At the close of trading, the stock was priced at Rs 621.30 on the BSE. In the case of a de-merger, the stock exchanges have a special trading window between 9.15 and 9.45 am during which time investors can place their bids on the screen. The exchanges decided on a base price of Rs 311 for the AFL stock; the closing price of Arvind Ltd on the last day of trading prior to the demerger was Rs 311.45. At 9.45 am, the stock opened at Rs 591, but soon hit the 5% upper circuit. The ratio for the demerger was 1:5; in other words, for every five shares of Arvind Ltd, an investor would receive one share of Arvind Fashions. AFL, which demerged from Arvind Ltd on November 29, 2018, houses the branded and retail business with products across price points. It reported a compounded growth in revenues and Ebitda, over FY16-18 of around 26% and 37% respectively, according to analysts at Anand Rathi Securities. The analysts said for 2017-18, it posted a net profit of Rs 13 crore, up from net losses of Rs 39 crore in FY16 and Rs 21 crore in FY17. The management expects a 17% revenue CAGR over FY18-22, to Rs 8,000 crore. The firm’s array of brands include U.S. Polo Association, Arrow, Flying Machine, Tommy Hilfiger, Gap, Sephora and Unlimited. Other brands include Calvin Klein, Aeropostale, the Children’s Place and Ed Hardy. The fashion retailer has a long-term licence agreement with 11 brands and creates designs for international brands like Aeropostale, Gap, Arrow and many more after adjusting for Indian requirements, the analysts said. The management aims to add 200 exclusive outlets in the next two to three years. The firm has made big investments in speciality brands like Unlimited and from next year, speciality retail and emerging brands would materially contribute to bottom line growth, Kulin Lalbhai, executive director, Arvind Ltd, had said in a recent interview. “Beauty concepts like Sephora will become a Rs 500-crore opportunity in few years and other concepts like Calvin Klein and GAP are also scaling up. They have hit the Rs 100-crore mark. Our speciality value retail format, Unlimited will also near Rs 1,000 crore next year,” Lalbhai added. AFL’s consolidated revenues stood at Rs 1,259 crore in Q3FY19, up by 17% y-o-y. The Ebitda increased 19% y-o-y to Rs 82 crore, while the profit after tax (PAT) increased by 98.5% y-o-y to Rs 8.4 crore. This growth in profit can be attributed to reduction of the deferred tax credit of Rs 5.6 crore from Rs 9.12 crore.<end_of_turn>

# Michigan couple caught having sex in hot tub at Kalahari, sheriff’s office says

SANDUSKY, Ohio– A Michigan couple refused to leave Kalahari Resorts after they were caught having sex in a hot tub, the Erie County Sheriff’s Office says.  Kamden S. Mack, 25, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Taylor C. Coats, 22, of Hudson, Mich., were charged with persistent disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing. Mack was also charged with escape.  Erie County Sheriff’s deputies were called to the hotel and water park Tuesday evening. Kalahari security said Mack became irate when they were confronted by a lifeguard for having intercourse. Deputies described him as “growlingly upset.”  Security tried to escort the couple back to the room to collect their belongings, but they took off running. Both were placed under arrest and deputies struggled to get Mack into the back of the cruiser.  According to the police report, Mack was able to open the door and run away because the rear passenger door did not have the safety lock engaged.  The deputy chased Mack and tackled him before putting him in the back of a different cruiser.  Both suspects were taken to the Erie County Jail.<end_of_turn>

# Greggs facts you need to know as bakery giant breaks £1bn annual sales

The company says publicity around the launch of its vegan sausage roll helped drive a sharp rise in sales.  The vegan snack made from meat substitute quorn, was launched at the beginning of the year, coinciding with Veganuary, when many people go vegan for a month.  It paid off, with sales rising by 9.6 per cent in the seven weeks to 16 February. Here are some of the key moments in the Greggs success story.  ● John Gregg started out 75 years ago with the goal of delivering – by pushbike – fresh eggs and yeast to the families of Newcastle.  ● Ten years later, he chained up his bike and opened Greggs of Gosforth in the High Street – baking and selling fresh bread and treats. There’s still a Greggs there today.  ● Changes over the years have been made to include freshly ground fairtrade espresso, calorie figures have been added to the menu and free WiFi provided.  ● The fame of Greggs’ steak bake spread to Still Game with one episode featuring e as a fictional Beefy Bake produced by Henderson’s the Bakers in the TV show.  ● There was a catwalk show with a difference in the run-up to London Fashion Week in 2015, which featured a dress made entirely from Greggs’ packaging including savoury bags and coffee cups.  ● The Greggs team know how to make you laugh on social media. Like the time they posted a pic on Twitter in 2017 of Fiona Bruce in a blue and yellow top of a similar pattern to the Greggs’ logo and asked, ‘Who wore it best?’  ● Greggs sells 1.5million sausage rolls a week.  ● Greggs announced plans to host Valentine’s Day earlier this year to serve up a romantic, candlelit dinner in its shops for the first time –with four courses and fizz – with doughnuts for dessert. The one-night menu of Greggs’ food given a special Valentine’s twist was on offer for £15.  ● Greggs now has 1953 stores across the UK, with expansion plans afoot.  ● Pre-tax profit last year rose 15 per cent to £82.6million, marking the fifth year in a row profits have increased.  ● The firm’s shares have almost doubled in value since July last year.  ● For the ad campaign for its vegan sausage roll, journalists were sent the snacks in mock iPhone packaging and stores sold sausage roll phone cases.  ● Publicity soared when Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan criticised the new snack on Twitter saying, “Nobody was waiting for a vegan bloody sausage, you PC-ravaged clowns.”  ● Photos of demonstrators on a street outside a branch of Greggs in Manchester led many to think an anti-vegan sausage rolls protest had been organised. But it was really about a Brexit deal.   ● The company’s involvement in the community goes back to the 60s, when Greggs started a free pie n’ peas supper for   older residents in Gateshead. Nowadays, they have an annual Children’s Cancer Run which has raised more than £5million for Cancer Research. And they provide a healthy breakfast for more than 6000 primary school children with their Breakfast Club programme.  ● They don’t use artificial colours, flavours, added trans fats or MSG.  ● They have 22,000 members of staff and serve more than six million customers a week.  ● They own their own supply chain and manage their own logistics operation.  ● They’re investing £100million in a major programme to create centres of excellence in manufacturing and distribution.  ● You can find a Greggs in various locations from retail parks and shopping centres to industrial estates. There are drive through Greggs and franchise partnerships in service stations and petrol forecourts.   ● Unsold food from shops goes to help others. There’s a dedicated application page for unsold food donations on the Greggs   Foundation website. Customers can come forward if they know of a good cause that could benefit from unsold food. The amount of unsold food donated to good causes has increased by 45 per cent since 2016.<end_of_turn>

# WrestleMania 35: Championship Matchup Predictions

WrestleMania 35: Championship Matchup Predictions  WrestleMania 35 will be happening live on April 7, 2019 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Two championship matches have already been confirmed. Brock Lesnar will be going head to head with Seth Rollins for the Universal Championship. We will also be having Ronda Rousey vs Charlotte Flair (or vs Becky Lynch if she defeats Charlotte Flair at Fastlane). Buddy Murphy will be defending the Cruiserweight Championship against the winner of an eight man tournament as well. There will almost certainly be matches for the Intercontinental Championship. Like the United States Championship, the Raw Tag Team Titles, the SmackDown Tag Team Titles, the Women's Tag Team Titles, the SmackDown Women's Title, and the WWE Championship as well. #1 Cruiserweight Championship: Buddy Murphy (c.) vs Tony Nese There is a big eight-man tournament going on to decide who will face Buddy Murphy at WrestleMania 35 for the Cruiserweight Championship. Tony Nese advanced to the semifinals by defeating Kalisto while Drew Gulak advanced to the semifinals by defeating Brian Kendrick. The two former allies will face each other in one of the semifinal matches. The other semifinalists were decided when former Cruiserweight Champions Cedric Alexander and Akira Tozawa faced off with each other and also when Humberto Carillo faced off with Oney Lorcan. Cedric Alexander and Oney Lorcan were the ones who advanced to the semifinals. Tony Nese will probably defeat his former ally Drew Gulak so that he can finally get revenge on the submission specialist while Cedric Alexander will almost certainly defeat a 'valiant' Oney Lorcan. The former Cruiserweight Champion will then almost certainly be defeated by Tony Nese in the finals. The Best Kept Secret will then likely turn on Tony Nese so that the Premier Athlete can turn face to set up this big WrestleMania feud. While the two talented cruiserweights will likely be relegated to the kickoff show once again, they will still likely have a great rivalry and a great match at WrestleMania in what will be the WrestleMania debut of both highly talented cruiserweights.<end_of_turn>

# Timothee Chalamet: ‘Armie Hammer brings so much to set’

NEWS COMPETITION Armie Hammer left a lasting impression on Timothee Chalamet when they filmed Call Me by Your Name. The 2017 drama was a massive hit with both moviegoers and critics, and bagged the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 2018 Academy Awards. A sequel is in the works, bringing Armie, Timothee, and director Luca Guadagnino back together, and reflecting on the original, 23-year-old Timothee revealed how impressed he was with his older co-star. “It’s a scary thing, as the last thing you want to do as an actor is throw your eyebrows all over an expression of love. Yet Armie had this idea of shooting the scene on a single track and Luca agreed. And it worked. I could never have offered something like that up and it just goes to show what a feel Armie has for the medium,” he praised of the 32-year-old to British GQ. “I mean, he’s an amazing guy. He checks all ‘-isms’ at the door, if you know what I mean.” Armie has been just as complimentary back, previously telling Variety that the Oscar nominee’s career has nothing to do with luck, and everything to do with talent. “Timmy was born to do exactly what he is doing,” he said. “He has been giving quality performances his entire life; we as the spectators were just slow on the uptake to appreciate him. I guess we weren’t really that slow considering he is one of the youngest nominees for an Academy Award ever.”<end_of_turn>

# Ocasio-Cortez says being a waitress is just as good as being a member of Congress

Ocasio-Cortez says being a waitress is just as good as being a member of Congress  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is taking issue with those who she believes are belittling her job as a bartender-waitress before she got elected to Congress.   I find it revealing when people mock where I came from, & say they’re going to “send me back to waitressing,” as if that is bad or shameful. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 8, 2019  It’s as though they think being a member of Congress makes you intrinsically “better” than a waitress.  But our job is to serve, not rule. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is taking issue with those who she believes are belittling her job as a bartender-waitress before she got elected to Congress.   I find it revealing when people mock where I came from, & say they’re going to “send me back to waitressing,” as if that is bad or shameful. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 8, 2019  It’s as though they think being a member of Congress makes you intrinsically “better” than a waitress.  But our job is to serve, not rule.  This is the second time in a month AOC has cited her "skills" as a bartender-waitress' in preparing her for life as a member of Congress.   Last month, Ocasio-Cortez championed the skills she learned in the restaurant industry after being praised for her questioning of Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, at a House Oversight Committee hearing.  “Bartending + waitressing (especially in NYC) means you talk to 1000s of people over the years. Forces you to get great at reading people + hones a razor-sharp BS detector,” she wrote on Twitter. “Just goes to show that what some consider to be ‘unskilled labor’ can actually be anything but.”  The woman who wants to end meat production and air travel has a "razor sharp BS detector"? Mmmkay.  What waitressing almost certainly didn't teacher was paranoia. AOC sent out a fundraising appeal claiming that the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee is "coming after" her.   The release starts by quoting an “AIPAC activist” threatening the political careers of Ocasio-Cortez and her first-year Democratic colleagues, Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.   The quote, saying they are “three people who, in my opinion, will not be around in several years,” was taken from a recent New York Times article exploring the political clout of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.  Except the “AIPAC activist” quoted, Stephen Fiske of Florida, confirmed to me that he has not been associated with the pro-Israel lobbying group for several years. The hardball he counsels in dealing with those who depart from centrist pro-Israel orthodoxies is not the style of the lobby, which discourages alienating safe incumbents.  The error is emblematic of the misconceptions that first helped spur the controversy leading up to Ocasio-Cortez’s fundraising pitch, which was posted Thursday on Twitter by Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs.  Fiske’s role as the chairman of a pro-Israel political action committee — unaffiliated with AIPAC, which is not a PAC — was the centerpiece of The Times article and seemed to confirm what AIPAC’s critics, including Omar, refer to as its hardball tactics. Omar has been at the center of a firestorm over Israel and anti-Semitism, fueled in part by a recent tweet charging that big spending by AIPAC had bought congressional support for Israel. It's not a question of waitresses or any other blue collar job being a disqualifying factor in getting elected to Congress. I've discussed Kant and Erasmus with cab drivers. What people mean when they say AOC should go back to waitressing is that her appalling ignorance manifests itself on a daily basis.  One can argue that her misconsceptions about AIPAC are boiler plate anti-Semitism. The all powerful Jewish lobby threatening to take her down is emblematic of either ignorance or hate.   The Times article got much right about how AIPAC operates: The lobby itself does not fund campaigns. Instead its members are expected to give to campaigns, and get perks (invitations to exclusive briefings, a chance to introduce their lawmaker as a speaker, more illustrious tags at conferences) if they are especially generous. They also are expected to cultivate close relationships with their lawmakers, volunteering for them, and above all to lobby them.   But by making Fiske the poster boy for AIPAC, The Times perpetuates a major misimpression. When Omar landed a seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, it reported that Fiske began calling lawmakers to complain and that he is “hoping AIPAC activists will punish” Omar with a primary challenge in 2020. Ocasio-Cortez will continue to embarass herself and her party not because she was a waitress, but because she is unqualified intellectually and emotionally to serve as a member of Congress. She's not alone on that score. Dozens of members from both parties should have stayed in their law office or private business. But most of them are smart enough to keep their mouths shut about things they know little or nothing about.  Thanfully for Republicans, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hasn't learned that yet.<end_of_turn>

# Bucks crush Hornets, become first team to 50 wins | Malay Mail

MILWAUKEE, March 10 — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 26 points and 13 rebounds, Brook Lopez scored 25, and the host Milwaukee Bucks beat the Charlotte Hornets 131-114 on last night.  The Bucks trailed by as many as 14 in the second quarter but exploded for 39 third-quarter points to take the lead before increasing their advantage to as many as 18 in the fourth quarter.  The Bucks became the first team in the league to reach the 50-win plateau. They are now 27-5 at home. They have won two straight and nine of their past 11.  Antetokounmpo played just 30 minutes, scoring 20 of his points in the second half. Lopez scored 18 of his points in the third quarter when the Bucks rallied and seized control.  The Bucks also got 18 points each from Malcolm Brogdon and Nikola Mirotic. Eric Bledsoe and Donte DiVincenzo added 11 each. The Bucks hit 17 3-pointers collectively.  The Hornets seemed to run out of gas after a 112-111 win over Washington on Friday night. They remain 10th in the Eastern Conference playoff race, now 1 1/2 games behind No. 8 Miami and a half-game behind No. 9 Orlando.  Kemba Walker led the Hornets with 25 points. Frank Kaminsky scored 16, Miles Bridges 15, Nic Batum and Jeremy Lamb 14 apiece, and Cody Zeller 10.  The Hornets were without Tony Parker and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Parker was given the night off, while Kidd-Gilchrist suffered a strained knee in the win over Washington on Friday night. The Bucks were without George Hill because of a groin injury.  The Hornets led 32-24 after one quarter. They pushed the lead up to 14 on three occasions in the second quarter, the latest at 48-34, before the Bucks closed the gap to 59-55 at halftime.  Lopez then went wild in the third quarter and the Bucks led 94-87 after three. Milwaukee then turned the game into a rout quickly in the fourth quarter, leading 124-106 at one point.  The Hornets were opening a four-game road trip. They will play at Houston on Monday with games at Washington and Miami later on the trip.  The Bucks will play at San Antonio today to open a three-game road trip. They’ll also play at New Orleans and Miami on the trip. — Reuters<end_of_turn>

# Glaciers and Views of Awe by Caspar Wolf

Well before the famous landscape paintings of Switzerland by Alexandre Calame (1810–1864), one of the pioneers of Alpine views was Caspar Wolf (1735–1783).  Wolf was born in the town of Muri in central northern Switzerland. He trained in Konstanz, and during the 1750s worked as a decorative painter in Bavaria, Germany. Attempts to sell his paintings proved fruitless, so he moved back to his home town in Switzerland. In 1769, he moved to Paris, where he worked with Philip James de Loutherbourg, before the latter went to London and became famous for his maritime paintings and industrial scenes, such as Coalbrookdale by Night (1801).  It isn’t clear whether Wolf painted this amazing scene of Bathers near a Waterfall in the Mountains in 1770, when he was still with Loutherbourg, or in 1776, when he was back in Switzerland. These hardy women seem content to bask in the sunshine and cavort unclad in the icy meltwater, as their dog watches in astonishment.  Wolf’s break came in 1774, when he moved to the city of Bern and made a deal to deliver two hundred paintings to a local publisher. Among these was this Panorama of Grindelwald with the Wetterhorn, Mettenberg and Eiger (1774), which is an unusually wide-angle view from what was then little more than a village.  He moved closer into the foot of the ice to paint The Lower Grindelwald Glacier with Lütschine and the Mettenberg presumably during the same visit. The scale of the ice cliffs here is given by the small group of figures who have walked up to gaze into its caverns.  He then used that basic view to construct Thunder and Lighting on the Lower Grindelwald Glacier, back in the studio probably between 1774-75. I apologise for the scanning artefact in this image.  He travelled around the Alps steadily working through his contractual commitment. By 1776, he had painted this view of The Lauteraar Glacier, also in the Bernese Alps. The large tabular rock was a popular spot for more adventurous tourists to sit and become inspired by the awe of the ice and mountains around them.  One of his most popular paintings was this view of the Devil’s Bridge in the Saint Gothard Pass, from 1777. The pass connects northern and southern Switzerland, and this section has been of great strategic importance. This bridge across the Schöllenen Gorge was first built in wood in around 1220, and was a key section of the route. It probably wasn’t replaced by a stone bridge until the seventeenth century, and by 1775 it had developed into that shown here, which was wide enough to allow passage of the first carriage.  Less than thirty years later, JMW Turner exercised his imagination and exaggerated vertical scale in his famous view from the bridge.  Wolf also painted sites of national significance, such as the castle of Schloss Neu Bechburg at Önsingen (1778), which was built in about 1250. This is also in central northern Switzerland.  I haven’t been able to discover much about Wolf’s working methods, but a pair of paintings which he made in about 1778 provide tantalising insight.  Wolf painted this study of The Geltenbach Falls in the Lauenen Valley with an Ice Bridge in oil on cardboard, almost certainly in front of the motif. This is now in the Clark Art Institute, and I apologise for the small size of this image.  He turned that into this finished painting of The Geltenbach Falls in the Lauenen Valley with an Ice Bridge that same year, presumably in his studio. Although 1778 isn’t particularly early for a plein air oil sketch, given the logistic problems associated with working outdoors in oils in this remote rural location, it is quite an achievement.  These falls were little-known at this time, but when nearby Gstaad became an internationally-known spa town in the nineteenth century, they went onto many tourist itineraries.  Wolf didn’t rely on oil sketches alone. This undated study in brown ink of The “Chute de la Tritt” Weir at Mühletal East of Innentkirchen also appears to have been made in preparation for a larger, finished work, which I have been unable to trace.  In 1779, prints made from Wolf’s paintings were exhibited in Bern, but the book didn’t sell. Wolf worked his way around Spa, Cologne, Düsseldorf, and finally reached Heidelberg in 1783, where he died at the age of only 48. Two years later, his publisher had a better response to a collection of thirty aquatints made of Wolf’s paintings. His work remains almost forgotten today.  Tomorrow, as a sequel to this article, I will show his paintings of the Lower Grindelwald Glacier to help demonstrate the effects of climate change.<end_of_turn>

# Fighting for Redemption

PATTAYA, Thailand — It was a peaceful moment for Chalermpol Sawadsuk, who has had very few peaceful moments during his life of violence and crime. His girlfriend, Saranya Meesuk, leaned on his tattooed chest after his long day of training in Muay Thai, or Thai boxing, and Chalermpol turned reflective. “Could you ever imagine that such a bad person as me would have a chance to have a nice family one day,” Chalermpol, 30, asked in his native Thai. “I think love is rehabilitation. I get up and find breakfast waiting for me each morning. But I wonder even more what kind of woman would fall in love with a man like me.” In his previous life, he hurt people for a living. When he was 18, Chalermpol says he became an enforcer for an organized crime group in Bangkok, where he collected debts, ran drugs and even killed those he was ordered to kill. At 23, Chalermpol was arrested and sentenced to 10 years for drug trafficking. While in Wainoomklang Prison, Chalermpol had time to think about his crimes and the trouble he caused others. After a year, he learned of a government program that rewarded inmates who trained and fought in organized Muay Thai bouts against other prisons. “When I was 8 years old my uncle taught me Muay Thai,” Chalermpol said. “I had some experience fighting inside the ring. I quit when I was about 15. I started to be unruly. I liked the feeling of being important to my friends, so I helped my friends to fight when they were in trouble.” Focused once again, Chalermpol thrived in the ring, winning 19 times with 14 knockouts. Under the government-sanctioned program, he had seven years cut from his sentence for winning, and was featured in a recent Showtime documentary about the success of the program. In his new life, Chalermpol Sawadsuk still hurts people for a living. Given his early release, Chalermpol saw fighting as a viable way to leave his former life of crime behind. He claims a mutual love of Muay Thai is how he met Saranya, who has helped him move on from his dark past. The two moved to Pattaya, on the Gulf of Thailand, to get away from Bangkok. Once there, Chalermpol joined a new gym that specializes in a more international style of Muay Thai. Before his latest bout, Chalermpol and Saranya went to a Buddhist temple to write a note to the recently deceased King of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej. “I wrote to king Rama 9 to thank him,” he said. “Without his pardon I would not be here.” Chalermpol sees Buddhism as a way to stay on a straight path. He says he can remember the faces of those he killed and how they pleaded for life, so he prays to Buddha every night. “ You ask for your present life not to be harassed by your past karma,” he said. Chalermpol knows he’s facing an uphill battle in learning a new fighting style. His younger teammates helped him recover from a workout with a contrast shower — alternating between very hot and very cold water. “The training is getting tougher and harder after each practice,” he said. Chalermpol traveled north to nearby Ayutthaya Park for his first fight since moving away from Bangkok. After a tentative first round, Chalermpol’s opponent, a taller Chinese fighter named Pui Yu Lim, took control of the fight and eventually knocked him down. Chalermpol lost by technical knockout, but his problems didn’t end there. After the fight, Chalermpol was taken to an ambulance, where it became clear that he had broken his hand and one of his fingers. His friend Jae, a former Muay Thai fighter who Chalermpol met in prison, accompanied him to the hospital. Back home with Saranya, Chalermpol was upbeat despite the loss. He’s been through worse. “I didn’t expect the fight to end that way,” he said. “Sometimes I think about going back to being a hit man, but I choose to stop it because I don’t want to commit more sins. I already have too many.”<end_of_turn>

# Ethiopian Airlines Grounds Boeing 737 MAX 8 Fleet After Crash

Ethiopian Airlines Grounds Boeing 737 MAX 8 Fleet After Crash   Ethiopian Airlines said Monday it had grounded its Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet after a crash that killed 149 passengers and eight crew. “Following the tragic accident of ET 302… Ethiopian Airlines has decided to ground all B-737-8 MAX fleet effective yesterday, March 10, until further notice,” the state-owned carrier said in a statement released on Twitter. “Although we don’t yet know the cause of the accident, we have to decide to ground the particular fleet as an extra safety precaution,” said the airline, Africa’s largest. All 157 people on board died when Nairobi-bound Flight ET 302 came down just six minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa. It ploughed into a field near Tulu Fara village outside the town of Bishoftu, some 60 kilometres (40 miles) southeast of the Ethiopian capital. China also grounded its fleet of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 in the aftermath. Among the dead were tourists, business travellers, and UN staff headed for a conference. AFP<end_of_turn>

# Jennifer Hudson Stuns In White Gown For Aretha Franklin Tribute Special

The star-studded Aretha Franklin TV tribute special that aired on March 10 featured a gorgeous performance from Jennifer Hudson, who looked beyond amazing in her white dress.   It’s been more than six months since we tragically lost Aretha Franklin, and the loss continues to hit Hollywood hard. Jennifer Hudson is one singer who has been greatly inspired by the Queen of Soul, so it only made sense that she hit the stage during a tribute special, Aretha! A Grammy Celebration for the Queen of Soul, which aired on CBS March 10. Jennifer looked absolutely amazing as she performed a medley of some of Aretha’s biggest hits like “Respect,” “Think,” and “Ain’t No Way” and more in a stunning white gown. The ensemble featured a low-cut neckline, and hugged Aretha’s figure absolutely perfectly.   To complete her look, J. Hud pulled her hair back into a sleek top knot, and her skin was absolutely glowing. She also wore gorgeous statement earrings as she sang her heart out, and it was overall such a beautiful look. Other performers at the event included Kelly Clarkson, Celine Dion, Brandi Carlile, Alicia Keys, Alessia Cara and more. It was hosted by Tyler Perry, who got choked up as he remembered the woman who had such a profound impact on his life. The special was filmed back in January.  Aretha was 76 years old when she passed away at her home in Detroit on Aug. 16, 2018. Her official cause of death was confirmed as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.  A massive public service was held for Aretha just days after her death, with special tributes and performances from stars like Stevie Wonder, Ariana Grande, Faith Hill, Bill Clinton, Chaka Khan and more. Jennifer, who also performed at the memorial service and did a tribute to Aretha at a pre-Grammys party, will be playing the singer in an upcoming biopic.<end_of_turn>

# Oklahoma bracing for crush of Kyler Murray Pro Day interest

Anything that isn’t NFL free agency may get lost in the shuffle this week.  Except for, you know, the guy who may go first overall in the 2019 NFL Draft.  According to Peter King of NBC’s Football Morning in America, Oklahoma officials are braced for a crush of interest in Wednesday’s Pro Day, when some guy named Kyler Murray will work out. Already, all 32 teams and over 100 members of the media have been credentialed for the event (compared to 80 last year for quarterback Baker Mayfield and 60 the year before for controversial running back Joe Mixon).  “That’s the way we want it to be at Oklahoma,” Sooners coach Lincoln Riley said.  Of course, the real interest will be in what Murray actually does. He’s reportedly going to go through the full scope of measurements, run a 40, and go through his scripted throwing workout.  Murray didn’t work out at the Scouting Combine, but checking in at 5-foot-10 and 207 pounds was the subject of great interest. Teams will be making sure he doesn’t shrink, while the teams at the top of the draft order will be watching that throwing workout closely. Then the top teams with specific interest (King mentions as likely the Cardinals, Raiders, Giants, and perhaps the Jaguars and Dolphins) will try to schedule private workouts.  And even though it will he happening the first official day of free agency, there will be plenty of attention on what happens in Norman, Okla.<end_of_turn>

# Resident counts '15 pieces of dog muck' on one small stretch of Burnley street

A Burnley resident has cried foul after discovering 15 pieces of dog muck on one street.  Mr Barry Joyce contacted the Express when, after a recent walk in Coal Clough Lane, he counted the dog dirt in a length of just 50 yards. Mr Joyce said: "The dog muck situation in Burnley is now worse than before we had the dog fouling laws. "It should not be just left there. It will not give visitors to Burnley a great impression to take away with them." In response to Mr Joyce's concerns, Burnley Borough Council warned that irresponsible dog owners who do not clean up their dog's mess face a £75 fine and encouraged residents to report instances of dog fouling. A council spokesman: "This is down to irresponsible dog owners who don't clean up after their dog. Our enforcement officers, including the dog warden, will issue a £75 fixed penalty notice to anyone caught not cleaning up dog fouling. "Officers patrol that particular area around four times a week. We encourage people to report dog fouling to us, providing the location and time of day this happens, so that we can identify 'hot spot' areas and target our enforcement work more effectively. "They can do that online at environmental.crime@burnley.gov.uk, by emailing streetscene@burnley.gov.uk or by phoning 01282 425011."<end_of_turn>

# 'Termination, adoption or keep - 3 words taught me how precious my baby was'

I didn't ask for extra chromosomes when I placed my order.  "Regular amount of chromosomes, please," I quietly requested.  But then came the news my order was definitely in production and, get this - I was being given extra chromosomes, for free.  I was mad, confused as to why I had been chosen for this totally unexpected, unrequested upgrade.  But I decided receiving my order in a few months time was better than getting nothing at all.  And then it arrived.  Our sweet Gwendolyn entered our lives in December last year - and she had Down's Syndrome.  They were right - the upgrade was so worth it.  Extra cute, extra special, extra joy and extra chromosome.  I met Josh in January 2016, and things moved pretty quickly.  After getting married the following year, we knew we wanted a baby so started trying right away.  But things weren't really going to plan and after a year, we still had no luck -so we turned to IVF.  Then came another blow.  Our first attempt hadn't worked, but we were so desperate for this baby - we knew we had to try again.  There was a lot of love and determination for it to happen.  Eventually, our dreams came true and we were told I was pregnant in April last year.  We were totally overjoyed - overwhelmed almost.  For the next week, I took around five or six pregnancy tests a day - just to prove to myself it was real.  It seemed too good to be true.  But with the joy, came worries that somehow the baby would be harmed.  Would they survive? Is everything going OK? Will the next scan go well?  You ask yourself a lot of questions.  Despite our natural fretting, the next 11 weeks were magical.  We were excited to meet this little person who was all ours.  We never imagined our bundle of love would come packaged just a tiny bit different.  The devastation hit four days after the 11-week blood test.  I was at work and a call from the doctor sent me flying from my desk - I couldn't even look or talk to my colleagues.  The pain was immediate.  Josh came home too, and we sat there in shared devastation at the news our baby would have a 95% chance of Down's Syndrome.  Those first few days can only be described as a grieving process - we grieved for the baby we thought we'd have and the magical pregnancy we had been enjoying.  "This happens to other people. How can this happen to me?" were my honest feelings and thoughts at the time.  It was an unreal time, but one I am glad to have experienced.  After days of feeling hopelessly down, we started thinking back over the previous weeks, when we were giddy parents-to-be.  So we picked ourselves up and contacted our local Down's Syndrome foundation - who were a huge support.  We were visited by people from the Down's Syndrome community and met some amazing and inspiring individuals.  I started to immerse myself in groups - from Facebook pages for support to local groups of expectant mums with the same diagnosis as my baby.  While I was embracing this new path, I still found those next three months of pregnancy hard at times.  I was sometimes afraid to talk to people about my bump and open up about my baby - I was worried I'd get pitying looks or people wouldn't be as excited for me as they would other mums.  But other than the ferocious love I already had for my baby, a glimmer of hope came in another, more unusual, form.  After the initial test, we were advised to go for a second, which would give a 100% accurate diagnosis.  Josh and I decided this was the best option.  We didn't want people telling us there was 'still a chance she would be fine' and that 'it might not be right'.  We wanted to know exactly who our precious daughter was and doing so really helped us fall back in love with my pregnancy again.  After the final test, which officially confirmed Gwendolyn had Down's Syndrome, we were handed three leafelts.  'Termination', 'Adoption' and 'Keeping your Baby'.  It was a lot to take in, but something struck us.  As we read the literature on adoption, we learned there was a huge waiting list for people wanting to adopt babies with Down's Syndome.  People were actually waiting to adopt my baby - and it hit me how precious and valued these children really are.  The rest of the pregnancy was normal and we loved seeing her wriggle around on scans - we were desperate to meet her and hopelessly in love.  At 37 weeks, doctors said my placenta wasn't functioning so well - another common effect of the extra chromosome.  We were told we'd be meeting our little girl that very same day and I got booked in for an immediate C-section.  The first sight of our little Gwendolyn was breathtaking - all 4lbs, 15 ounces, of her.  She was tiny, but perfect.  With her being a smaller and premature baby, we had to leave her in hospital for a week as nurses monitored her feeding before allowing us to take her home.  Staying away from her was so hard, we eventually began staying at her side in the night.  In the days we'd go to 'baby school', as we nicknamed it - where nurses and doctors told us how to feed her and care for any needs she may have.  When we finally took her home, it was magical.  We had the baby we'd dreamed of for so long.  The road to getting there hadn't been what we expected, but we had our sweet Gwendolyn to show for it.  Today, Gwendolyn is a healthy and happy baby.  But we've been told she may need surgery at six months old to help with a heart canal defect.  Still, she doesn't let it bother her - she loves her food and she's so engaged and happy.  Looking back at my journey to this point, I think it was important to grieve after first receiving the news about Gwendolyn.  All feelings and emotions are valid and it's a big shock to be told a huge event in your life isn't going to plan.  But I was able to change my persepective.  Who is to say one child is more special than another because they're good at maths or studying?  They are alive, they are happy, healthy and doing well - that's what brings me joy now.  I look at Gwendolyn and see this unique little girl, and I love her even more.  She reminds me of all the wonderful things, in all sorts of wonderful ways, nature can create.  Jessica runs an Instagram blog on her journey of motherhood so far, called Our Sweet Gwendolyn<end_of_turn>

# Manchester United FC goalkeeper 'not to blame' for Arsenal defeat

The Gunners have an impressive home record this season and extended their run to 15 league games without defeat at the Emirates Stadium with a 2-0 win which moves them above United and into fourth.  Granit Xhaka’s long-range effort caught out De Gea before a contentious second-half penalty allowed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to seal three vital points in the race for Champions League qualification.  Solskjaer, who tasted domestic defeat for the first time since his appointment as caretaker manager in December, saw both Romelu Lukaku and Fred hit the woodwork.  On a day where Aston Villa ’s Jack Grealish was attacked by a Birmingham fan, an Arsenal supporter appeared to push United’s Chris Smalling as he invaded the pitch after Aubameyang’s goal.  Metropolitan Police later confirmed one man had been “arrested on suspicion of common assault and pitch invasion”, with Arsenal condemning the incident and apologising to both Smalling and United.  In terms of the result, Solskjaer refused to blame de Gea for not keeping out Xhaka’s curling effort, instead questioning why his defence afforded the Switzerland international so much room.  “I don’t class it as a mistake by de Gea,” he said. “I was stood right behind the ball and we don’t put enough pressure on Xhaka, who must be Brazilian by the way because he struck the ball and it swerves and moves.  “It goes to David’s left and changes direction completely. It’s one of those things.”  “Spurs lose, we lose, Chelsea draw, it’s going to be down to the wire, the last few games definitely,” added Solskjaer.  “But we’ve given ourselves a great chance to be in that fight. Three points behind third, two behind fourth, it’s a good position to be in.”<end_of_turn>

# Analysis | The Democrats’ premature fantasies about packing the Supreme Court and nixing the filibuster

As 2020 Democrats charge forward with an increasingly ambitious policy agenda, a couple bold ideas for implementing it are working their way into the conversation too: Packing the Supreme Court and eliminating the filibuster.  Michael Scherer has a must-read story on the former, which would involve adding Supreme Court justices — rather than waiting for vacancies — to tilt the court to the left. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) have both entertained the idea, as did former Obama attorney general Eric Holder last week. (Holder considered running for president but decided against it.)  As for the latter, Washington Gov. Jay Inlsee (D-Wash.), another 2020 hopeful, made a forceful case Sunday for reducing the threshold in the Senate from 60 votes to a majority, and some other prominent Democrats, including Gillibrand and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have also entertained it. “We’re not going to get anywhere as long as Mitch McConnell has the keys to the car,” Inslee said.  These ideas are borne of a clear and understandable frustration with the glacial pace of legislation when Republicans wielded the filibuster during the Obama years. And as a primary strategy, they make sense. “We’re going to make sure we can actually get things passed and upheld by the Supreme Court,” is an attractive message.  But is the timing right?  Whatever the merits of these ideas, there is a real question about whether Democrats should be telegraphing them right now — at a time when they simply don’t have the power they need to make them happen. In fact, if anything, it would seem Republicans are more likely to gain that kind of control in the coming years. And if they think Democrats are just going to do these things, why not beat them to the punch?  To pack the Supreme Court, Democrats would need control of both chambers of Congress to pass a resolution, as well as the presidency to nominate the new justices. On the filibuster, they would need to control the Senate to change the rules and also the presidency to sign the legislation. They would also probably need the House to pass bills the other two would support.  So far, they only have one of those three levers of power to make these changes worthwhile, while Republicans have two of the three. That means Democrats would need to win not just the presidency in 2020, but also pick up at least three Senate seats. At this point, the likeliest path if they lose Sen. Doug Jones’s (D) seat in Alabama is that they get pickups in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina and hold all their other territory.  It’s possible Democrats could pull it off in 2020. But the maps are simply more favorable to Republicans and should be for years to come, for a variety of reasons including population sorting and gerrymandering in the House. Fully 60 senators come from states that President Trump won in 2016, and the median House district went for Trump by more than three points — all in an election in which he lost the popular vote by more than two points.  Let’s say Trump is reelected and Republicans somehow win back the House, either in 2020 or 2022. Trump has repeatedly pushed for getting rid of the filibuster, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has resisted him. If McConnell sees the Democrats potentially doing it when they return to power, though, what’s the sense in waiting to find out? Why not turn a 5-4 conservative Supreme Court into a much more solid 7-4 court? Why not get rid of a filibuster that seems unlikely to last past the next time Democrats are in charge? And what better way to overcome objections from within your party than to point to comments from the opposing party that suggest they’ll just do it all when they get the chance?  To be clear, these are still ideas that are mostly promoted by lower-tier presidential hopefuls and not the front-runners. But they seem to be sprouting new life as Democratic frustration grows. And the party and its presidential hopefuls have also shown little will to try to tamp down bold ideas that are gathering support on the left.  But just because something is cathartic or helps you in a primary doesn’t mean it’s smart strategy for the larger battle. Democrats paved the way for Republicans to get rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees when they got rid of it for other nominees in 2013. Trump then won the 2016 election and tilted the Supreme Court by filling two vacancies with less than 60 votes. (Republicans might have gotten rid of the filibuster anyway, but Democrats surely made it easier.)  These kinds of things carry unintended consequences when the other side wins elections — which Democrats should be very familiar with.<end_of_turn>

# Solskjaer to get Man Utd job, Zidane set for Real Madrid spree, Pochettino STAYS at Spurs

Zidane made a stunning return to Real Madrid last night, the club where he won three consecutive Champions League titles as a manager. And it now appears only a matter of time before Solskjaer is appointed permanent manager of Manchester United. Those two moves will come as a delight for Tottenham fans and club chairman Daniel Levy - who were bracing themselves for a fight to keep Pochettino this summer. Spurs’ domestic season has hit a banana skin in recent weeks, with Pochettino’s team now without a win in four Premier League games following their disappointing 2-1 defeat at Southampton on Saturday. Tottenham have already booked their place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League though, after dispatching Borussia Dortmund 4-0 over two legs. And despite their recent poor results in the Prem, Spurs fans have been given reason to cheer by their rivals. Zidane’s return to the Bernabeu will no doubt coincide with a huge spending spree from the Spanish giants this summer. Real president Florentino Perez is said to have promised the 46-year-old Frenchman a budget of £300million to blow after the end of this season. The Independent claim Zidane is interested in ending Eden Hazard’s seven-year stay at Stamford Bridge and also has an eye on Spurs playmaker Christian Eriksen. While that could be bad news for Spurs if Real ramp up their interest in Eriksen, 27, the chances of their manager moving are non almost non-existent. In January, Pochettino publicly claimed he hoped to be Tottenham boss for 20 years and perhaps even finish his career with the club. "I hope, or I wish to be here 20 years, and decide to leave or to finish my career here," he said. "I am so focused here, and want to help the club to achieve what the club want to be in history." And now it is easy for fans to believe their Argentinian manager, with the speculation about him upping sticks to Real Madrid squashed thanks to Zidane. Manchester United has also been touted as another potential next destination for Pochettino, despite reporters being met with hostility by Spurs for trying to get their man to talk about the Red Devils. However, Solskjaer has virtually landed himself the job after cementing his place in United folklore as a manager and guiding them past Paris Saint-Germain into the Champions League last-eight. The Mirror go as far as to say that United want to confirm the Norwegian as their permanent manager during the upcoming international break. And all that should leave Spurs feeling confident of starting next season in their new home with the same manager.<end_of_turn>

Contact Information: PO Box 35566, Head Office, Khalifa City A, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Etihad Airways Engineering, the largest independent maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) service provider in the Middle East, has announced the addition of Airbus A350 maintenance capabilities to its extensive inhouse portfolio. Etihad Airways Engineering is part of the Airbus MRO Alliance and has emerged as a centre of excellence for the Airbus A380, having supported the A380 fleets of Etihad Airways and third-party customers in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Australia. The company continues to extend its coverage of major commercial aircraft types and has now received the landmark approval for Airbus A350 maintenance, awarded by the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA). The first A350 aircraft to arrive for maintenance in Abu Dhabi comes from the company’s long-term client, LATAM Airlines group, the leading airline group in Latin America. The aircraft will undergo a heavy maintenance check and modifications as part of its routine maintenance program. The C-check will be followed by full stripping and painting of the aircraft in LATAM’s livery. The airline group is due to send additional A350 aircraft for scheduled maintenance in Abu Dhabi during the year. Etihad Airways Engineering Chief Executive Officer Abdul Khaliq Saeed said: “Building on our position as a centre of excellence for the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A380, we are now ready to support the A350 fleets of our customers from around the world. Our A350 capability demonstrates our commitment to providing comprehensive aircraft maintenance and engineering solutions for all major aircraft types under one roof. “Our investment in developing A350 maintenance capability recognises the growing global demand for service on this aircraft type forecast over the coming years. It is also a reflection of the trust and confidence that valued customers such as LATAM place in the expertise and workmanship of our multinational team at Etihad Airways Engineering”, continued Mr. Saeed. Etihad Airways Engineering’s state-of-the-art facility is the largest independent commercial MRO facility in the Middle East, located adjacent to Abu Dhabi International Airport. Aircraft hangars at the facility cover approximately 66,000 sq metres, including 10,000 sq metres of aircraft painting facilities and a custom-designed hangar that can accommodate up to three Airbus A380 aircraft simultaneously. The company has successfully completed maintenance projects over the years for airlines across the world.<end_of_turn>

# Tim Tebow among Mets' spring training cuts, will start season in Triple-A

Tim Tebow won't open the season with the Mets, but he'll begin 2019 just a step away from the majors.  The Heisman-winning quarterback was one of eight players cut from New York's spring training camp Tuesday morning and is slated to open his third full season of professional baseball with Triple-A Syracuse.  We've optioned Paul Sewald and Jacob Rhame to minor league camp and re-assigned Arquimedes Caminero, Andrés Giménez, Dilson Herrera, Rymer Liriano, Ali Sánchez and Tim Tebow to minor league camp. #Mets - New York Mets (@Mets) March 12, 2019 Tebow took the demotion in stride, telling reporters he was grateful for the time he had to learn from more experienced players and coaches during his time in big-league camp. Overall, he said it's a "night and day" difference from last spring, which saw him sprain his ankle early in camp when he stepped on a sprinkler head while running in the outfield. "Last year just at the start was so disappointing, Day 1 getting injured, and then it's like an uphill battle the whole time, just very frustrating," he said, via MLB.com. "This year I feel like it's a very different atmosphere, just being able to learn and work and improve, and also show that as well."  "Every day," Tim Tebow says, "I'm all in on doing this." - Anthony DiComo (@AnthonyDiComo) March 12, 2019 Here's Tebow on his reassignment to Mets minor league camp: pic.twitter.com/MUYhzkZXdm Tebow went 4 for 15 (.267) in Grapefruit League action as he looks to build on a decent season at Double-A Binghamton last year. The 31-year-old slashed .273/.336/.399 with six home runs in 84 games, improving his OPS by nearly 80 points from his first minor league campaign before his season ended in late July with a broken bone in his hand. While Tebow's chances of becoming an impact player in the majors remain slim, his faith in the quest hasn't wavered. "Every day, I'm all-in on pursuing this," he said. "You've been around here, you've seen that. That's just my goal and we're going to give it as good a shot as we can."<end_of_turn>

# Paragon Care : Non-Executive Director Appointment (MAR2019) | MarketScreener

ASX ANNOUNCEMENT paragoncare.com.au 13th March 2019 Australian Securities Exchange Company Announcements Office NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR APPOINTMENT The Board are delighted to announce the addition of Mr Bruce Bian as an independent non-executive director to the Paragon Board. Bruce emigrated from China in 1988, and is an Australian citizen living in Sydney. Bruce gained his law degree from Sydney University and has significant experience across multiple facets of practice including Chinese and Australian relations. He brings to the boardroom team thirty five years of diverse industry experience from Australia and Asia, and his strong understanding of market trends in the Asia Pacific region support his demonstrated experience in driving strategic business growth whilst overseeing strong legal compliance and corporate governance. The healthcare sector is highly regulated and demands very high levels of compliance, adding to the commercial value of bringing legal qualifications to the board skillset. Further to this Paragon has a keen appetite to develop its cross border trading capabilities, a key consideration in the recent acquisition of Immulab and its application to the Asian markets. We see Bruce's competencies and experience working in Asian markets as enabling Paragon to further develop our export business. The opportunities in China although longer term are substantial, and Bruce's involvement in that piece of the growth strategy is seen as highly valuable. The Board will now comprise six directors, five of whom are considered independent non-executive directors. - ENDS - Contacts Andrew Just Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director Tel. 1300 369 559 Email: andrew.just@paragoncare.com.au About Paragon Care Limited Paragon Care (ASX:PGC) is an Australian based listed company and a leading provider of medical equipment, devices and consumables for the Australian and New Zealand market.

# Hands on: Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus review

It's been a relatively quiet MWC 2012 for Samsung since the company decided to hang fire on the Samsung Galaxy S3 and ditched its press conference but it has managed to bring a few phones that we hadn't yet seen. Not least the Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus, which launched at this year's CES and brings a bit of an update to the handset with the Ace name. Where the original Samsung Galaxy Ace offered Android 2.2, a 3.5-inch screen and an 800MHz processor, the Galaxy Ace Plus comes with Gingerbread (Android 2.3), a 3.65-inch screen and a 1GHz processor. So when it comes to looks, the two are very similar. The Ace Plus comes with 'metallic points of interest' that may well be metallic to look at but are actually very plasticky to touch and attract fingerprint smudges like nobody's business. The 3.6-inch screen isn't bad, although it suffers the same smudge-based woes and images and text have a tendency to look a little pixelly. This being a Gingerbread phone, there are a few buttons to play with. Samsung insists on putting the power/sleep button on the side of the handset which confuses us no end, and there's a home button and volume slider too. On the back you'll find a 5MP camera and a smart but uninspiring mesh-effect back plate. The Galaxy Ace Plus is not the slimmest handset we've seen this MWC but it's not too chunky for a mid-range Android.<end_of_turn>

# Liam Williams set to play for Wales in Grand Slam clash with Ireland

Liam Williams set to play for Wales in Grand Slam clash with Ireland after recovering from shoulder injury picked up in win over Scotland Liam Williams was forced off in second half of Wales' win over Scotland The full-back took a bang to the shoulder in the game at Murrayfield But Saracens man should be fit for Wales' Grand Slam clash with Ireland Wales are confident Liam Williams will be fit for Saturday's match against Ireland, as they prepare to beat the 'best team in the world' to win a Six Nations Grand Slam. The full-back, 27, took a bang to the shoulder against Scotland and went off in the second half, but the Saracens man should return to play in Cardiff. 'He just took a little bit of a stinger on his shoulder,' said Robin McBryde, the forwards coach. Wales are confident Liam Williams will be fit for Saturday's match against Ireland 'He is improving. I daresay if he had been a front-row forward he would have stayed on. 'His return to training is gradual and there has been no contact and we will gradually increase that to see how he is but everything is moving in the right direction at the moment. 'He is playing so well at the moment. He is solid under the high ball and playing at his best at the moment.' And McBryde bigged up the Irish, who have won each of their games in the Championship after losing to England in the opening round. The full-back, 27, took a bang to the shoulder against Scotland and was forced off 'Ireland looked very competent against France and went about their business as they have for a while now,' he added. 'I think they were a little bit shocked about the physicality England brought against them but they have found their stride again. 'We know it will be a big test for us. We have put ourselves in a great position and it's a chance in a lifetime for some of these boys and that is not lost on anybody. 'We are facing arguably the best side in world rugby to do that on the weekend. 'New Zealand have not played for a while but I would say they (Ireland) are the team to beat at the moment. 'It would be no mean feat in the Six Nations and games can be decided on small margins and decisions. Williams has started every game for Wales so far in the 2019 Six Nations championship 'We have done exceptionally well to put us in this position but it won't mean anything if we don't finish the job on the weekend.' There will be no love lost between the sides on Saturday either. 'The players are familiar with each other having been on numerous British and Irish Lions tours together,' said McBryde. 'With that familiarity there is a respect for each other and it brings an extra edge. It is a lot more personal when you want to beat the guy you know and that will be the case on Saturday. 'There will be lot of personal battles and scores to settle and hopefully we will have some rugby being played as well. 'Both teams are used to playing on the big stage when something is at stake and once you have tasted success you know there is no secret formula to it. 'It will be no different on Saturday.'<end_of_turn>

# The summer of hard seltzer is coming. Here’s how 4 of the top brands stack up.

The summer of hard seltzer is coming. Here’s how 4 of the top brands stack up. About an hour ago If there’s a drink that exists, someone will make it boozy. Consider it the Rule 34 of the beverage industry. Boozy root beer. Boozy Capri Sun. Boozy kombucha.  So, given the recent mega-popularity of seltzer, a boozy version of the pleasantly neutral drink was hot on its heels. And now that warmer weather is approaching, it’s poised to become even bigger, as more companies introduce new brands and flavors of the fizzy malted drink. In 2018, alcohol-infused seltzer sales grew about 169 percent, to nearly $487.8 million, while volumes increased 181 percent, according to a January Nielsen report. The category now makes up 1.3 percent of total beer category dollar share. Meanwhile, beer sales have flattened out, with category-wide dollar sales growing only 0.7 percent.  Many major beer brands already have a hard seltzer: MillerCoors has Henry’s Hard Sparkling Water; Boston Beer Co., of Sam Adams fame, shares a parent company with Truly; Mark Anthony Co., the parent company behind the Mike’s Hard brand, has White Claw; and Anheuser-Busch has the brand formerly known as SpikedSeltzer, which recently rebranded as Bon & Viv, with a splashy Super Bowl commercial.  Now more brands are getting in the game: Corona announced this week that its Refresca brand of spiked seltzers would hit stores in May. The sparkling water brand Polar is teaming up with Harpoon Brewery to launch a hard seltzer line called Arctic Summer, debuting at the end of April. And smaller craft breweries such as Kentucky’s Braxton Brewing Co. and Colorado’s Oskar Blues are jumping on the trend, too.  What exactly is hard seltzer? It’s a malted beverage — similar to Smirnoff Ice or Zima — or it’s made from brewed fermented sugar. The drinks are gluten-free, and they tend to be both low in calories and sugar, which has made them popular with dieters. None of the brands we sampled have more than two grams of carbohydrates. More geared toward a backyard barbecue or a trip to the beach, they sell better in warm weather but haven’t picked up much steam at restaurants. They’re also a good mixer: Make a vodka tonic with one, and it won’t dilute the drink as much.  We tried four of the most popular brands of spiked seltzer — one of the mixer-worthy citrus flavors for each, to make them easier to compare. Here’s how they stack up:  Bon & Viv  Flavors: Clementine hibiscus, grapefruit, cranberry, pear elderflower, black cherry rosemary, lemon lime, prickly pear  Calories: 90  ABV: 4.5 percent  Okay, first impression: Clementine hibiscus has a sort of all-purpose cleaning solution smell? But you can definitely taste the hibiscus. Despite its lower alcohol content, the alcohol flavor is more pronounced in this one, sort of like a Smirnoff Ice. It’s that tongue-coating fermented sugar taste. You won’t mistake it for a La Croix or a Bubly, and that’s probably a good thing. It has the cutest mermaid branding.   Introducing Bonnie and Vivian—the makers of BON & VIV Spiked Seltzer—who are making their debut in this year’s Super Bowl. With delicious fruit & botanical flavors and 0 grams of sugar, their mythical product seems too good to be true, but it’s real! #BONandVIV #themythisreal pic.twitter.com/rfuqrbBT8w  — BON & VIV Spiked Seltzer (@BONandVIV) January 24, 2019   Henry’s  Flavors: Passion fruit, lemon lime, strawberry kiwi, blueberry lemon, pineapple, peach mango  Calories: 88  ABV: 4.2 percent  The lightest in calories and in ABV, but, like Bon & Viv, has a slightly stronger alcohol flavor. Its can looks an awful lot like a regular sparkling water, which could come in handy if you want to, uh, drink it in a public park (at your own risk; we do not endorse this behavior) (but it does camouflage well).   Two fruits taste better than one. Introducing the NEW zero sugar, 88 calorie Henry’s Hard Sparkling Water Fruit Fusions Variety Pack 🎉 pic.twitter.com/Sqii1r8Pcj  — Henry's Sparkling (@henryssparkling) March 11, 2019   White Claw  Flavors: Raspberry, lime, grapefruit, black cherry, mango  Calories: 100  ABV: 5 percent  White Claw is lighter in fragrance but stronger in flavor, and it doesn’t taste very boozy. Basically, it’s La Croix that gets you drunk!   🌊 + 🥭 = pic.twitter.com/s0YxxPQoiG  — White Claw Hard Seltzer (@WhiteClaw) February 27, 2019   Truly  Flavors: Colima lime, lemon & yuzu, grapefruit & pomelo, black cherry, blueberry & acai, passion fruit, pineapple, pomegranate, mango, wild berry, raspberry, orange, rosé  Calories: 100  ABV: 5 percent  Despite having the most flavors, and a strong scent, Truly is less flavorful than the other seltzers, and this is a good thing! Too much flavor and you might as well be drinking a — gasp — soda. It’s as though an orange gave some seltzer water a fleeting but meaningful glance. You cannot taste the alcohol at all, which is going to be dangerous when you down like, six of them at Ali’s pool party.   — Truly (@trulyseltzer) February 27, 2019<end_of_turn>

# What is the Ukrainian government's 'blacklist'? | Euronews answers

Those on the "blacklist" are considered a "threat to national security", according to Ukranian authorities. Russians dominate both, as tensions between Moscow and Kiev have reached a post-Soviet high. Ukraine has not given an explanation why individuals are put on the "blacklist", but people perceived to have made pro-Russian comments can quickly find themselves on the list. International figures who recognise Ukraine's sovereignty are often marked on the country's "white list". What is the 'blacklist'? The "blacklist" is a directory of international figures who Kiev says pose a threat to the country's national security. Ukraine's security forces provide the Ministry of Culture with an influential person's name who they have identified as a national security threat to the country. Once identified, Ukrainian radio and broadcast companies are barred from airing any forms of entertainment involving the cultural figure. Who is on it? Although the majority of the people on the lists are Russian, a number of nationalities are represented including individuals from the US, Italy, Germany, and Belarus. There are currently 147 international figures banned from entertaining the Ukrainian public in any way. Italian recording artist, Albano Carrisi, known as Al Bano, is Kiev's most recent addition to the "blacklist", but he is not alone. Other notable figures: Russian film director, Nikita Mihalkov American actor, Steven Seagal American professional boxer, Roy Jones Jr Russian ballet dancer, Nikolay Tsiskaridze American lead singer of Limp Bizkit, Fred Durst Russian pop-rock artist, Yulia Chicherina Russian billionaire real estate mogul, Yelena Baturina Russian film actor, Alexander Bashirov Chairman of the Board of Directors of Lenfilm, Fyodor Bondarchuk Russian singer, Alexander Buinov Russian entertainer, Yuriy Galtsev Russian writer, Arkadiy Inin Belarusian TV presenter, Dzmitry Shepialeu What happens to those that are on it? Those on the list become a persona non grata in Ukraine and cannot enter the country's territory. As well as being banned from Ukrainian airwaves, musicians cannot perform in Ukraine, authors' books are not permitted to be sold, and actors' and directors' films are banned from the TV and cinemas. What is the 'white list'? Ukraine's Ministry of Culture also compiles a catalogue for people who they say have a "high appreciation towards Ukraine." This "white list" is comprised of cultural icons, actors, artists and painters from different countries, who openly agree with a sovereign and democratic Ukraine. Who is on the 'white list'? Ukraine's "white list" primarily features celebrities and prominent Russian writers and musicians, who are seen as deserving of the support of the Ukrainian state. Notable figures: American actor, Tim Roth American actress, Hayden Panettiere Russian rock musician, Andrey Makarevich American singer and actor, Jared Leto German singer of the Scorpions, Klaus Meine Georgian born Russian writer, Boris Akunin Georgian singer, Vakhtang Kikabidze Ukrainian-born American actress, Milla Jovovich American actress, Vera Farmiga<end_of_turn>

# Boeing Crash Reaction Fascinates, Confounds | KXL

One of my football coaches used to have a saying;  “There are two kinds of people in the world. There are wimps — and there are tough guys.”  This was a simple way of motivating young, aggressive males to understand their circumstances, playing in a violent and dangerous sport. Naturally, no football team can operate when its players don’t understand and exercise mental and physical toughness.  I think this idea applies to Sunday’s crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, licensed to Ethiopia Airlines, and the world’s reaction to that crash.  Many people say the “safe move” for Boeing, is to simply keep the plane on the ground. As we’ve learned — this is the move that’s being made.  Of course, there is always honor in preventing disasters, but this approach is getting lambasted as rather “wimpy” in some private conversations I’ve had.  These are private conversations with people who know much more about all this than I do.  They all seem to agree people are panicking about the 737 Max 8 when they likely shouldn’t be, at least not yet.  These experts admit there could be an issue with the aircraft, but they remind us — we don’t know that yet. They are pulling out their hair, exclaiming, “the crash investigation is only three days old!! We haven’t even seen the black box data!!”  And thus, here we are — “John and Jane-Q public”, engaging in a circular argument about whether or not to do something based on the likelihood of a disaster — when we have almost no idea about the likelihood of said disaster.  Watching all this unfold has been particularly fascinating for me, even frustrating to some degree.  It makes me imagine an argument between two parents…..over whether or not their kid should play football….<end_of_turn>

# BlackBerry morphs into billion-dollar AI cyber company

Former smartphone maker BlackBerry just became a billion-dollar cyber company with the acquisition of artificial intelligence and machine learning company Cylance. John Chen, the CEO, said security was at the heart of the transformation. Continue Reading Below “Everybody remembered BlackBerry as the handset company. But what is the essence of that handset? Security,” Chen said to FOX Business’ Stuart Varney on Wednesday. “This is why President Obama uses it, you know. This is why a lot of politicians, bankers, all [use] it — because of security.” But BlackBerry, which is based in Canada, hasn’t exactly ditched the old brand just yet, Chen said, rather it has expanded on what it does well. It also just established a Government Solutions unit. “I didn’t really [create] a new company out of the old company,” he said. “What I have done was to take what we do well minus the hardware component, license it to other people to build their phone, but use a lot of security encryption technology that is in your phone to make it secure.” Advertisement Irving, California-based Cylance was also just awarded a contract by NATO to use its encrypted voice technology. When Varney asked whether Chen can offer a guarantee that its technology cannot be hacked, he replied, “This world — cat and mouse — it’s just hard to crack it.” He added: “I think it would be naïve of me to say that it will never be hacked. We try to stay ahead of the game. This is like locks on doors. You can put all kinds of locks and gadgets on it, you can’t say [it will] never be broken though.”<end_of_turn>

# Graham Nash to walk Akron audience through his music-filled career on March 16

Even though Graham Nash is a two-time Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee — with The Hollies and Crosby, Stills & Nash — the iconic singer still loves to tour the Cleveland museum. “I plan on going back to see the Eddie Cochran guitar,” said Nash, calling from New York City. “I love looking at guitars. I’ve been to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame many times. I really truly enjoyed going to see some of those instruments that influenced my life in terms of music. “I think the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is a wonderful organization. I know there are a lot of people who don’t agree with it, but, holy Toledo, look at the people that are in there: The Beatles, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly and Elvis.” That visit presumably will take place when the Grammy Award-winning artist brings his “An Intimate Evening of Songs and Stories with Graham Nash Tour” to Northeast Ohio March 16 for a performance at the Akron Civic Theatre. The singer-songwriter is supporting his recently released double-disc, 30-track box set, “Over the Years...,” which is divided between Crosby, Stills & Nash greatest hits and gems, as well as early demos to some of his biggest songs. After spending so much time delving into his vast catalog, Nash said he learned something. “I decided I’m actually worth a (expletive),” he laughed. “That’s what I got from all of that. I’ve written all of those songs many years ago, and it was fun to hear my original demo of ‘Teach Your Children’ and ‘Marrakesh Express.’ ‘People that don’t write music but enjoy music are often fascinated by the songwriting process: How does it happen? Where does it come from? Where do songs come from? Where was your head at when you wrote ‘Our House?’ All of those kinds of things. Frankly, in my shows, I talk about some of that.” One of Nash’s biggest hits is, of course, “Our House,” which was written a half century ago and appeared a year later on Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s 1970 album “Déjà Vu.” The song continues to be a centerpiece of his show. “I didn’t realize it would last this long, quite frankly, but it’s a song about ordinary moments,” Nash said. “It’s an ordinary moment between me and my girlfriend, who at the time happened to be Joni Mitchell. It was a rainy, miserable, cold day in Los Angeles. “I had taken Joni to breakfast. Going back to her car we passed an antique store. Joni saw a vase in there she wanted to buy. When we got back to the house in Laurel Canyon, I said, ‘Hey Joni, why don’t I light a fire and you put some flowers in that vase you bought today.’ That’s the opening of ‘Our House.’” Nash’s other memory of “Our House” is the fact the band decided to cut the song’s rise on the pop charts short to put out the politically charged “Ohio” — about the Kent State University shootings. “We did because we thought it was more important that people realize we’re killing our children for their God-given right to protest what their government was doing in their name than us having another hit single,” Nash said. “I mean, at that point I had 15 to 18 top 20 hits with The Hollies before I ever met David (Crosby) and Stephen (Stills).” Nash will also will perform a few of those Hollies tunes in Akron, including “Bus Stop” and “Carrie Anne.” “The setlist is an interesting dance that changes every night,” Nash said. “We have a certain skeleton because we know people want to hear (songs) such as ‘Teach Your Children,’ ‘Military Madness’ and ‘Immigration Man.’ These are songs that were written 50 years (ago) and are still incredibly relevant today. I mean, ‘Immigration Man,’ come on.” In addition to being responsible for some of classic’s rock’s most tuneful songs, the other thing Nash and company are known for is being socially conscious and not afraid to speak their minds. Despite being 75, he still feels a responsibility to speak out. “And the reason why (you) don’t hear (those songs) on the radio much anymore is because the people who own the most media you can count on two hands,” Nash said. “They don’t want anybody rocking the boat. They want you to lie down, shut up, be sheep and (be sold products). That’s what’s going on here.” Dovetailing back to his upcoming Rock Hall visit, does Nash being a two-time inductee mean he gets special privileges such as getting to hold and maybe even play the Eddie Cochran guitar? “Oh, no, I haven’t been that courageous yet to ask,” Nash said. “But who knows, maybe this time I will.”<end_of_turn>

# New experience for Lagan visitors

Lisburn & Castlereagh City Council is supporting Lagan Navigation Trust in developing its new and innovative ‘One for the Heart’ project, which will pilot a new visitor experience using innovative, immersive technology along and around the Lagan Navigation.  The Lagan Navigation’s rich history has impacted on communities along its 27 miles, weaving a rich tapestry of heritage, place and environmental change over 300 years. Alderman William Leathem, Chairman of the Council’s Development Committee said: “It is the future vision of the Council and its partners in the Trust that the Navigation will be restored alongside revitalisation along the whole corridor. “This project is a wonderful opportunity for both local people and those from farther afield to experience what the Lagan currently has to offer and to learn more about the rich and interesting history of the Lagan Navigation using their own devices.” Brenda Turnbull, Chief Officer of Lagan Navigation Trust added: “This new experience will continue to drive the Trust’s aim to enhance the Lagan Navigation as a connected visitor destination.”<end_of_turn>

# Plans for new Berwick leisure centre to be unveiled

Plans for a £20million new sports and leisure centre in Berwick will go on show next week.  Proposed facilities include a 25m swimming pool, a learner pool and leisure water, a sports hall, fitness suite and studios, a lawn green and indoor bowls hall, spa facilities, café and soft play, an outdoor all-weather pitch and adult care and teaching facilities. Northumberland County Council and Active Northumberland are holding two public drop in events. The first will be held in The Swan Centre in Tweedmouth on Tuesday, March 19, between 1 - 7pm. The second will be held in Berwick Workspace, Boarding School Yard, 90 Marygate on Saturday, March 23 between 10am-2pm. The drop in sessions will provide an opportunity for members of the public to learn about the leisure centre plans in more detail, to speak to the project team and to ask questions or give any feedback. The new development aims to provide a high quality, inclusive and modern community leisure facility for the town. Consultation has been carried out to hear directly from residents as to what they would like to see provided at the new centre. The proposal will also include new landscaping and public open space as well as an overall increase in parking. The new centre will be situated on the site of the existing Swan Centre and will be run by Active Northumberland, the charitable trust that manages leisure services across the county on behalf of Northumberland County Council. Coun Cath Homer, cabinet member with responsibility for leisure said: “Active Northumberland staff are all incredibly professional and are delivering some fantastic leisure services for the town. However, the hard fact is that the current Swan Centre has millions of pounds worth of backlog maintenance issues, and is no longer fit for its intended purpose. “The new centre, with state of the art facilities, will provide fantastic opportunities for fun, fitness and relaxation for residents and visitors to the town and will ultimately be far more efficient to run too.” The brand new leisure centre will be built on the site of the present Swan Centre and its construction which is expected to start later this year will be phased alongside the existing facility’s demolition providing consistent access to leisure facilities during the development. Mark Tweedie, chief executive of Active Northumberland said: “Just like the existing Swan Centre has done, this new facility will serve the Berwick community for generations to come. Modern lifestyles mean that most of us are not as physically active as we should be which can be detrimental to our long term health, so it's never been more important to provide great places to help people be active and have fun. “Active Northumberland is really looking forward to working closely with the local community and Northumberland County Council to deliver this exciting new development for the town." If you are unable to make either of the drop in events, information boards will be on display at The Swan Centre for the full week from March 19. Advance Northumberland, a new regeneration company established by Northumberland County Council is responsible for delivering the project.<end_of_turn>

# A boozed-up drunk had to be restrained with a spit hood after he spat blood at a police officer

An injured drunken man hit a police officer in the face with his bloody spit and racially abused another officer as they tried to help him.  John Michael Barker, 50, was approached by police on Hambleton Avenue, at North Wingfield, Chesterfield, after they received a report that a man may have been assaulted and they alerted the ambulance service. Prosecuting solicitor Robert Carr told a Chesterfield magistrates’ court hearing on March 13: “Mr Barker was agitated and swearing at one of the officers and he was told to calm down. “He couldn’t stand up and was unable to keep his balance and two officers helped him on to a stretcher and he had to go to hospital.” However, Mr Carr added that Barker became angry and was shouting and swearing at the paramedics and he lunged forward to punch one of them but missed as police restrained him. As doctors tried to treat Barker at Chesterfield Royal Hospital he became apologetic but started shouting and was abusive again, according to Mr Carr. Mr Carr added: “A police officer said he looked directly at him and the defendant spat at him and the spit was full of blood from a cut on his lip and it went on the officer’s face and his jacket.” Barker was restrained while he used a derogatory term for a homosexual towards the officer and threatened to hit him before a spit hood was placed over his head. The officer who was spat at stated that he would rather have been punched and he had been left feeling physically sick. A soon as the spit hood was removed, according to Mr Carr, Barker became threatening again and racially abused another police officer. Barker told police during a subsequent interview that he recalled telling one officer to go back to Africa and he accepted he had spat blood but he had not intended for this to hit the other officer. The defendant, of Hambleton Avenue, North Wingfield, Chesterfield, pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer and to using racially aggravated threatening behaviour towards another officer after the incident on February 23. Defence solicitor Kirsten Collins said Barker does not dispute the facts but he has little recollection because he was heavily intoxicated. Magistrates adjourned the case until March 21 to consider a probation report and to allow Barker to be assessed for an Alcohol Treatment Requirement before sentencing.<end_of_turn>

And it’s a moving target because the platform makers assume that more content is better, so they shovel new content into the system as fast as they can.

# Increased police presence at Hillcrest High School Thursday after threat deemed not credible

Increased police presence at Hillcrest High School Thursday after threat deemed not credible  MIDVALE, Utah — There will be an increased police presence at Hillcrest High School Thursday after a report of graffiti that could be construed as a threat, but police do not believe there is any danger.  Kirsten Stewart of the Canyons School District said they were made aware of some graffiti in a school bathroom Wednesday afternoon.  That graffiti could be construed as at threat, Stewart said, so they alerted police. Police did not believe the graffiti amounted to a credible threat.  The district notified all households with students who attend Hillcrest but said they believe students will be safe at school Thursday. Counselors are available to speak to any students who have concerns.  There will also be an increased police presence at the school out of an abundance of caution, and administrators and faculty members plan to spend more time in the hallways to be visible and reassure students.  Stewart said while the threat is not considered credible, they take any threat against a school seriously and if they locate the vandals they will be held responsible by both the district and by police.<end_of_turn>

He said he knew he was "gonna marry that girl." “This wasn’t the time or place," he noted. "Not just because it wasn’t my party, not because it was their moment to dance, not even cause I was nervous about dancing in front of folks. It’s cause I knew I was gonna marry that girl.”“So I shook my head with anxiety, moved to the back of the crowd and never even introduced myself," he continued. "16 years later it’s happening this [weekend] is the time, and the place is my wedding. I’m gonna dance with my wife because this is my destiny.”See more on Chance in the video below.GET THE ET NEWSLETTEREmail By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyRELATED CONTENT: Chance the Rapper Marries Kirsten Corley Chance the Rapper Explains the Sweet Way He Met His Fiancee Backstreet Boys Found Out Chance the Rapper Used to Collect Their Action Figures (Exclusive) Backstreet Boys Say Super Bowl Commercial Co-Star Chance the Rapper Collected Their Action Figures Related GalleryBaby On Board!

# No room for error, CEC tells observers during first meeting

In the first briefing session with about 1,800 Election Commission central observers Thursday, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora told them there was no scope for error during the Lok Sabha and select assembly polls in the country. The CEC also underlined that concerns about abuse of money power and social media are “posing newer challenges” with changing times.  The full Election Commission, comprising CEC Arora and Election Commissioners Ashok Lavasa and Sushil Chandra, apart from other senior officials of the poll body, briefed the central observers about their roles and responsibilities on election duty. The observers are drawn from various central services like the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Revenue Service (Income Tax and Customs and Excise) apart from others, and they are taken on special ‘EC duty’ till the elections process ends.  An EC spokesperson said Arora told the officers that they need to be earnest and had no choice but to ensure that “no mistakes” are committed. He recalled that during the recent state elections all the good works done by the poll panel were relegated to the background due to “miniscule” instances like slippage in following protocol on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and VVPAT (Voter verifiable paper audit trail) procedures, a few names missing from the electoral rolls and delay in counting of votes.  The CEC told them that while they render their task, the EC closely observes them in order to ensure that they sincerely discharge the assigned duties, the spokesperson said. The endeavour of the EC is not only to conduct free and fair elections but also transparent, clean and ethical elections, the CEC said.  EC Ashok Lavasa, the spokesperson said, reminded the observers that they need to ensure implementation of all instructions of the poll body “in letter and spirit.” “He (Lavasa) also mentioned that the recently launched CVigil App has helped empower every citizen also to help the EC keep a vigilant eye on model code violations,” the spokesperson said.  EC Sushil Chandra, who last held the post of the CBDT Chairman, had a special word for the about 800 expenditure observers saying their role “becomes crucial when methods of extending inducements to voters are becoming very innovative.”  The spokesperson said the observers, during the daylong briefing sessions, were given comprehensive and thorough inputs about various aspects of election management by other senior officials of the EC. “The observers were also acquainted with the various information technology initiatives and mobile applications launched by the Commission for voter facilitation as well as effective and efficient management of election process in the field. “They were provided functional demonstration of EVMs and VVPATs and briefed about the multifarious technical security features, administrative protocols and procedural safeguards that surround the EVM ecosystem to make it completely secure, robust, reliable, non-tamperable and credible,” the spokesperson said.  The observers were also informed by the EC about a maiden mobile app called the ‘observer app’. Using this app, observers can submit their report securely to the EC and they will also get all important notifications, alerts, and urgent messages on this app while they are on duty, the spokesperson said. The CEC, ECs and other EC brass also talked about the entire polls process, code of conduct, rules, laws and other subjects to the observers that they will encounter during the polls for over two months time now, officials said.  The EC’s mechanism to curb blackmoney and illegal inducements like liquor and drugs and the teams deployed to check these was specifically shared with the expenditure monitoring observers, they said. Another round of meeting, albeit on a smaller scale, could be held later this month, they said. The EC had declared the dates and processes for elections to the 17th Lok Sabha on March 10.  The elections will begin on April 11 and polling would be held over seven phases through May 19, followed by counting of votes on May 23. Assembly polls in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim will be held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha election.<end_of_turn>

# Hospice Simcoe expands programming, opens second location in Barrie

Anyone who has lost a friend or relative now has a new place to grieve.  Due to increased demand for service, Hospice Simcoe is boosting access to its Visiting Hospice and Bereavement-based programs and opening a second location in Barrie; the new facility will be at 130 Bell Farm Rd.  “This space will allow our social worker and volunteer team to provide emotional, spiritual and psychosocial support to dying individuals and their families from the time of diagnosis through to bereavement,” executive director Kelly Hubbard said.  Hospice’s current 10-bedroom, 24-hour residential care facility at 336 Penetanguishene Rd. will remain open.  The Bell Farm site will offer several of the hospice’s existing community programs, but new support groups that deal with pregnancy and infant loss, caregiver relief and adults ages 25 to 40 who have lost a parent or spouse, will be introduced. There will also be a program designed to help children understand grief.  Unless otherwise specified, community programs are available to people of all ages, regardless of whether they’ve had previous contact with the hospice. Participants are required to preregister for programs, but all services are free.  The hospice has operated community programs since 1988 — the residential facility opened in 2009.

# Lilly Singh becomes first woman to lead late-night show on a broadcast network, will replace Carson Daly- Entertainment News, Firstpost

Lilly Singh becomes first woman to lead late-night show on a broadcast network, will replace Carson Daly  Indian-origin YouTube star Lilly Singh will host a show on NBC that will replace Carson Daly's Last Call.  Daly, who hosted the show for the past 17 years, had announced his exit last month. He said he will "concentrate on his duties as host of the Orange Room on Today, as host and producer on The Voice and to spend more time with family".  Singh's new show, A Little Late With Lilly Singh, will debut in September on the 1:30 am spot which is currently occupied by Last Call With Carson Daly, NBC announced Thursday.  Her appointment is a historic feat as it makes her the first woman to lead a late-night show on a broadcast network.  Singh's show will be a half-hour program and she will be conducting in-studio interviews with a variety of guests. She will also create and star in pre-taped comedy sketches and signature segments, according to Entertainment Tonight.  Born to Indian parents in Canada, Singh is known as Superwoman among her fans. She has over 14 million followers on YouTube.  On Thursday, during her appearance on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show, the YouTube star talked about her new gig. "I'm so excited because I truly get to create a show from scratch. I get to make it inclusive...and create something I really believe in," Singh said.

# Full house crazy for Stamos at 2016 Beach Boys concert in Abilene

Editor's note: This Greg Jaklewicz column originally published March 10, 2016. Bruce Johnston, who has been a part of the Beach Boys since 1965, walked up to the two tweens who were standing backstage. He asked them if they were enjoying the show. It was intermission. The dad of one of the girls told Johnston that the 12-year-olds had come to see John Stamos but they were becoming Beach Boys fans. Johnston smiled as if he had heard that a few times before. He barely finished signing an autograph for them when they bolted. Stamos had emerged from his dressing room. The scene was Sunday’s concert that had thousands of fans humming Beach Boys songs at work Monday. It’s impossible to compare concerts. Personal taste gets in the way. But this concert, many decided, had to be one of the best ever here. It was historic. The group never had been to Abilene. Garth Brooks, when he sold out the Taylor County Coliseum in 1992 in his heyday, had appeared at a local club when he was known for just one song. KISS ... well, no band has sold out the Coliseum twice in one year. That’s historic. Famous Stamos, 52 and a hot commodity now, was just a teenager when that happened. He’s a star of “Fuller House,” the 13-episode update of “Full House” that’s on Netflix. It hasn’t gotten good reviews (Stamos humorously has read those aloud on late-night shows) but fans aren’t expecting Emmys. It’s still a big hit with tweens, teens and even women closer to Stamos’ age. I asked a concertgoer how she liked the Beach Boys show. “What a fabulous concert,” she said. “Stamos was a hot number, too.” Hot number? I thought that term went out when bosses stopped asking secretaries to make the coffee. Stamos has been on Fox’s “Grandfathered” and also will be in the upcoming “My Big Fat Greek Wedding II.” He’s half-Greek, thus the qualifying dark, handsome features for a character named George. If you Google his name, there are stories about a new “mystery woman” in his life. I know, ladies, too bad. He was on “General Hospital” before “Full House,” the sitcom on which he was Uncle Jesse Katsopolis. During the concert, he sang “Forever,” which he performed when he was getting married on “Full House.” That set off screams and screens, and the darkened Coliseum turned bright with illuminated smartphones. Stamos has been a pal of the Beach Boys for 30 years. Time to time they were on “Full House.” Or so I am told. I haven’t watched each episode three times like a 12-year-old girl I know. He is an accomplished musician, probably more talented than another General Hospital alum gone big time, pop-rock singer Rick Springfield. Springfield’s biggest hit was “Jessie’s Girl.” Strange how these things tie in. Stamos can sing, drum and play the guitar. He didn’t just hang out on stage with the Beach Boys. He legitimately is a band member when he joins them. Musically, I was impressed. The two tweens missed seeing Stamos before the show and then waited and waited and waited during a 20-minute intermission that seemed to take two hours. They passed the time talking to Johnston and saying a shy “Hi!” to Mike Love when he walked by. They discovered they were standing next to Stamos’ guitar case and had their photo taken with it. And then came Stamos out of his dressing room. Quick photo before the second half started, they were told. But a funny thing happened on the way back to the stage. He talked with them. “So, what’s your favorite episode?” “You like the show?” “I saw your mom. She’s a hot number.” He didn’t say that. But I told her he was thinking it. He signed autographs for each, posed for another photo with two women who probably could not believe he wasted so much time with the little girls. Then it was back on stage. But wait, that was not all. The Beach Boys worked through hit after hit and finally, got to one song we all were waiting for. “Ah, ba ba ba Barbara Ann. Ba ba ba ba Barbara Ann.” The whole place began rockin’ and reelin’. On stage came four girls. Herded, tentatively, to the center of the stage between Love and Stamos. Awwwwww, how cute, the moms in the crowd thought, whipping out their smartphones. How cooooool, the guys in the crowd thought, wishing they could be a Beach Boy one night. How come I’m not up there, the jealous girls in the crowd thought, making frowny faces. A few more kids joined in — probably every kid at the show — including a certain two tweens. They could hardly move, shocked at this sudden opportunity, and fully aware that thousands of people were watching. What a thrill for 7-year-old Myla Manzano, who stood closest to Stamos and took his hand. Her open-mouthed expression said it all. The concert was a great memory for all who attended. But it was especially a thrill for two tweens who hoped just to see “the most famous person I’ve ever met,” as one said, but got more. Mr. Stamos, I’ll take others’ word that you’re a “hot number.” But you’re also a stand-up guy.<end_of_turn>

# Swenson receives feedback on Santa Cruz Harbor Village project

LIVE OAK — The Santa Cruz Harbor Village project is in the works of going from a site plan to a reality.  The project is a mixed-use development with central lodging, commercial use, housing and public open space at the corner of Seventh Avenue and Brommer Street.  In the early 2000s, the Santa Cruz County Redevelopment Agency acquired three parcels of land at the corner of Seventh Avenue and Brommer Street and near the north entrance of the Santa Cruz Harbor. The County Redevelopment Successor Agency took ownership of it in 2011, and in 2013 the agency created a management strategy to sell the property within the county’s land use and zoning requirements. In 2017, the agency chose Swenson Builders to be as the developer for the site, aimed at accommodating visitors and creating commercial use and public open space.  The first public meeting for the development was in April 2017. A community meeting was held Wednesday night at Live Oak Elementary School for feedback from neighbors and county residents.  Five Swenson employees and three PlaceWorks employees were available to answer questions during the meeting. Approximately 110 people signed into the meeting, according to Bruce Brubaker, associate principal of community planning consultant company PlaceWorks. Attendees could visit five stations (site background, site plan, circulation of traffic, uses and architecture) for questions and comments.  There is no public access to the site.  The site area is 8.3 acres: 2.3 acres of open space, with 1 acre designated as a public park. The property falls under a C2-D Community Commercial Zone, which allows for hotels, motels, and inns, multifamily residential and mixed use, and buildings to not exceed three stories or 35 feet, according to the meeting presentation.  Swenson is looking at about 265 proposed parking spaces in total, but needs to determine if car parking is a priority, or if parking will be limited to accommodate multimodal transportation, such as bikes and buses, according to Development Project Manager Jessie Bristow.  Dennis Smith, chairman of the Santa Cruz Port Commission, said the commission wants to support the community through this process. “We want to be involved so we know how the community feels, what they think,” he said.  The port commission submitted a Request for Proposal to develop the project but was not selected. However, the port commission did pass a resolution in support of the County of Santa Cruz’s efforts in facilitating the sale and development of the project.  Two concerns expressed at the meeting were traffic and parking, Bristow said. He said Swenson is working with the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and the port commission on how the 2-acre site could be used for boat, trailer and vehicle parking.  County resident Janet Benaquisto said her husband parks in the overflow lot, which is used for boaters’ trucks and trailers, and he has been stressing about it not being available in this project.  “I don’t want to see something go away that’s important for the boating community,” she said.  Benaquisto said she thinks the whole county should know about this development. “This is our county tax money,” she said. “We all have a say in this.”  The community meetings are one of the first steps in the development process. Swenson will adjust the site plan based on community and county feedback, then submit a pre-application with the Santa Cruz County Planning Department, Bristow said.  The next community workshop is from 10 a.m. to noon Saturday at Live Oak Elementary School, 1916 Capitola Road. Spanish translation services will be available and food will be provided. The workshop will provide the same information as the previous workshop. For information, visit santacruzharborvillage.com and harborneighbors.weebly.com.<end_of_turn>

# Man jailed over street stab murder

Shevaun Sorrell death: Man jailed for Deptford murder  A 29-year-old man has been jailed for life for stabbing another man to death in south-east London. Shevaun Sorrell was discovered fatally wounded in Creek Road, Deptford, on 25 August last year. He was taken to hospital but died soon afterwards. A jury at the Old Bailey found Dana Powell, from Lewisham, guilty of Mr Sorrell's murder by a majority verdict of 10 to two. Powell, who denied the killing, will serve a minimum of 25 years in prison. A post-mortem examination found Mr Sorrell died from a stab wound to the chest. Det Ch Insp Mick Norman said Powell "faced overwhelming evidence that he was responsible for the death". "I hope that Shevaun's loved ones gain a measure of comfort from today's sentence," he said.<end_of_turn>

# Hotline: It's Paul Heckingbottom who's the fool not brave Steven McLean

Sorry seems to be the hardest word, according to Elton John - and now Steven McLean too.  For that one word is giving him no end of hassle after Hibs boss Paul Heckingbottom let rip at the referee for phoning Steven Gerrard to apologise for a decision that went against them on Rangers’ recent visit to Easter Road.  Fact is he’s damned if he says sorry and and damned if he doesn’t.  One minute referees are branded aloof, arrogant and out-of-touch, then the moment they show their human side by holding their hands up to an honest mistake they still cop pelters.  Which is where we start with Eddie Easson, Ballingry, who said: “I cannot believe the hypocrisy of Scottish referees.  “Steven McLean apologised to Gerrard but did he say sorry for his crazy decision a couple of years ago involving Celtic at Hampden? Did he heck.”  Alistair Cook, Edinburgh, said: “Steven McLean made a blatant mistake earlier this season when Jordan Jones dived to win a penalty for Kilmarnock against Dundee - but there was no phone call to Neil McCann to say sorry. So why does he phone Gerrard?”  Others jumped to the whistler’s defence and reckon Heckingbottom was wrong to shoot down a guy for being honest enough to admit to a mistake.  Alan Clark emailed: “For years managers have been asking that referees explain decisions and admit to mistakes. When one actually does he gets slaughtered by some manager who’s barely arrived in Scottish football.  “Heckingbottom is the fool, not Steven McLean who should be commended for apologising for a blatant mistake. It would be great if more referees had the bottle to do the same.”  Jim Robertson emailed : “The Hibs manager says it’s OK if the referee had spoken to Gerrard after the match to admit his error but not to phone him a few days later to say the same.  “Referees are getting castigated no matter what they do or say. Give them a break or there won’t be any of them left.”  Robert Hunter emailed : “Cheat, lie, even attack people, but don’t be honest and whatever you do never give a meaningful or genuine apology - it’s the Hibs way!”  John Caw emailed: “Surely there will now be a plethora of referees coming clean and owning up to all the mistakes.  “Celtic’s phone line will be buzzing with apologies all round. Yes I do have a vivid imagination.”  Brian Wilson, Paisley, said: “As a St Mirren season ticket holder I wonder when Andrew Dallas is going to apologise to Oran Kearney.”  Such is the tit-for-tat can of worms that McLean’s apology has just opened.  As far as Rangers fans are concerned though it’s not McLean who owes them the biggest apology - it’s their players after their Scottish Cup exit to Aberdeen killed their season.  Jim Craig, Sussex, said: “As a Rangers fan for 60 years I can put up with having a bad night skill wise. But I can’t put up with a bad night in terms of attitude because that’s what we got. Aberdeen beat us hands down for desire and that’s what won them the game.”  Stephen Johnstone, Ardentinny, said: “I read that cutbacks are forcing Glasgow City Council to paying off street sweepers.  “Well Gerrard should be first to offer them employment because that Ibrox dressing room needs cleaned out from top to bottom. And Dave King should be the first to go.”  Celtic’s former scout John Park is being touted for a return to Parkhead to be reunited with Neil Lennon, but one caller isn’t having either of them.  Robert Leckenby, Stonehouse, said: “Giving the job to Lennon is a massive step back for the club.  “Yes he got us to the last 16 in Europe but he only won five out of 13 trophies. Everyone goes on about Park bringing in players like Virgil Van Dijk and Victor Wanyama, but what about Efrain Juarez, Derk Boerrigter and Teemu Pukki?  “They brought in 44 players together at a cost of £28.8m and how many of them were really a success?”<end_of_turn>

# The 22 Most Ridiculous Things That Have Ever Happened On 'Riverdale'

The 22 Most Ridiculous Things That Ever Happened On 'Riverdale,' From Betty's Strip Tease To Archie's Juvie Stint Every week, Riverdale seems to introduce an even wilder storyline. Before the CW show premiered in January 2017, there was skepticism about how a show based on the wholesome Archie comics, but dark, would work. Surprisingly well, as it turns out! That doesn't mean there aren't crazy plot holes, insane names, bonkers storylines, and questionable resolutions, but the most ridiculous things that have happened on Riverdale often just leave fans wanting more. With every insane thing that's already happened, how could the writers possibly up the ante? Seeing them go increasingly off the rails has become half the fun of watching. Take a quick glance at the Riverdale subreddit, and you'll see posts like, "Veronica doesn't make sense anymore," "Hahahahaha, who are you, show?" and "Okay, so like, what even is the farm? Like seriously." They're all valid points that often raise more questions than answers, but it also reveals how committed Riverdale fans are. No matter what twists and turns the show throws at viewers, they're along for the ride. When the Pretty Poisons were added to the growing roster of town gangs, why not? When a mythological, branch-adorned creature called the Gargoyle King showed up as the latest Big Bad? Sure! When Jughead uttered the line, "No one's innocent in Crime Town"? Fine, whatever. Because there are so many to keep track of, here are the 22 most out-there things that have happened on the show so far ‚Äî with more assuredly to come. 1When Cheryl Bribed Archie to Date Her In a brief storyline from Season 1, Cheryl had a crush on the hunky redhead, and bought him a new guitar and music lessons so that he'd accompany her to family events. 2When Jughead Gave This Infamous Speech Jughead. Is. Weird. Got it?! 3When Archie Totally Hooked Up With His Teacher This show has everything: hot teens, hot teachers, and hot teens hooking up with hot teachers. But since Miss Grundy's relationship with Archie was clearly illegal, the Black Hood took care of her for good in Season 2. 4When Cheryl Burned Down Thornhill It's clear that the Blossom daughter doesn't have a happy home life, but going full Carrie and setting her mansion on fire was pretty drastic. 5When Polly's Cousin Impregnated Her Between Cheryl and Jason's eerily close bond, Penelope Blossom's marriage to her adopted brother, and Polly and Jason's twins, Riverdale has an odd affinity for incest. 6When Betty Pole-Danced At The Whyte Wyrm Who was more uncomfortable ‚Äî Jughead, Alice Cooper, or viewers at home ‚Äî as Betty undid her Chambray button-up to reveal a racy lingerie set underneath? The Cooper daughter proceeded to perform the world's most somber pole dance to the tune of "Mad, Mad World." 7When Archie Formed The Red Circle At the beginning of Season 2, Archie enlisted some jocks to form the Red Circle (which is somehow different from the Dark Circle). They filmed a "threatening" video directed at the Black Hood, declaring that they were legion, and they would find him. 8When Cheryl Stalked Josie Choni are cute and all, but do you remember when the head cheerleader gave Josie a bloody PIG'S HEART in Season 2?! Yeah, no one else seems to, either! 9When Betty Had A Brief Cam Girl Career Prompted by her fake brother Chic (more on him later), Betty began exploring her "dark side," which mostly involved wearing a black wig and lacy bras. 10When Chic Was ‚Äî What Was He, Exactly? The "online gigolo" used to know Alice Cooper's oldest son, Charles Smith, who she gave to the Sisters of Quiet Mercy as a teen. Chic decided to impersonate Charles after killing him, duping the Coopers for quite some time. But after Betty learned her real brother's fate, she led Chic to the Black Hood, who presumably killed him. RIP Chic. He died as he lived: being creepy. 11When The Vixens Wore Funereal Cheerleading Outfits These black uniforms were utilized at Midge's funeral, where Cheryl performed a song casket-side. 12When Archie Became An Aspiring Mobster In an attempt to please his girlfriend's dad, Archie started interning for Mr. Lodge and frequently said the phrase "make my bones." 13When There Were Characters Named Poppa Poutine & Small Fry This potato-themed father and son duo were both killed in Season 2. I guess you could say they *puts on sunglasses* jumped out of the pan and into the fryer. 14When The Other Two Pussycats Disappeared Seriously, where did Valerie and Melody go? Are they still in Riverdale? Did they make it to the big time? Are they still wearing leopard print and cat ears, day and night? These are the questions I have!!! 15When Polly's Twins Levitated While this has something to do with the Farm, this baby-floating hasn't been explained...yet, at least. 16When The Vixens Sang "Jailhouse Rock" Outside Archie's Juvie Center Everything about Archie's juvie arc is ridiculous. Not only did he give his fellow inmates an inspirational talk about how high school football is like life, but when Veronica and the rest of the Vixens walked out of the forest with a single boom box and began singing with no microphones, the boys went crazy for their somehow-audible performance. 17When Riverdale Introduced Gryphons & Gargoyles There are a lot of name knock-offs in Riverdale, but this Dungeons & Dragons knockoff is next level. 18When Veronica Tried To Fly Under the Radar With This Outfit In an attempt to help Archie break out of Juvie, Veronica and Reggie wore disguises that made them look like an old-timey couple who'd come straight from the race track to pick up their ne'er-do-well teenager. It...did not work. 19When Riley Keough Tweeted Her Way Onto The Show In March 2018, the Girlfriend Experience actor tweeted, "I just want to be cast in Riverdale," and consequently appeared in Season 3 as a shady character named Laurie Lake, who tempted Archie with her sexual charisma. Iconic! 20When Veronica, A Teenager, Opened A Night Club I don't know how liquor licenses work in Riverdale, but they seem to be pretty lax. When Veronica first opens La Bonne Nuit, she decides to only serve mocktails, but somewhere along the way, alcohol started appearing on the menu. 21When Archie Was Mauled By A Bear In The Canadian Wilderness It's unclear what exactly this storyline accomplished, but one thing is clear: the old Archie can't come to the phone right now. Why? BECAUSE HE'S DEAD! 22When Veronica Uttered The Word "Mobsplain" Ronnie created this term to describe the way her father's capo's talked down to her. It's a pretty iconic phrase that would be difficult to incorporate into everyday conversation, due to its specificity. And who knows what will happen in the rest of Season 3. Will we finally figure out what the Farm is all about? Will we discover that Chic isn't dead after all? Will Veronica learn that there are consequences to her illegal actions? Will Archie finally take the SAT? The world is Riverdale's oyster.<end_of_turn>

# Paris Jackson says it's 'not her role' to defend dad Michael over backlash

Paris Jackson has said it ‘isn’t her role’ to defend her father Michael Jackson against the backlash he has been subjected to since Leaving Neverland aired in the UK and the US.  The documentary – broadcast on HBO and Channel 4 – explores claims made against Michael by Wade Robson and James Safechuck, accusing him of sexually abusing them when they were children.  Some viewers were left ‘disturbed’ by the graphic detail included in the divisive documentary and turned against Michael after it aired.  The Michael Jackson estate and his family have strongly denied the claims made in the documentary and Paris has praised Michael’s nephew Taj Jackson for speaking so openly of his support for the late star, while claiming it isn’t down to her to defend her dad.  Paris was seen venting on Twitter after pictures circulated in the press of her out with her boyfriend in New Orleans.  When one fan suggested the interest in her has been raised because she hasn’t yet publicly responded to the documentary, Paris tweeted in response: ‘There’s nothing i can say that hasn’t already been said in regards to defense. taj is doing a perfect job on his own.  ‘i support him. but that’s not my role. i’m just tryna get everyone to chill out and go with the flow, be mellow and think about the bigger picture. that’s me. (sic)’  While Paris hasn’t commented on Leaving Neverland, she has hit back at claims she was worried about the documentary ‘ruining her acting career’ and defended her dad’s ‘good heart’.  One user tweeted Paris telling her that her father’s ‘legacy’ has now been ‘ruined and his name smeared forever’ because of Leaving Neverland.  She replied: ‘Yeah they do that to everyone with a good heart and tries to make a difference, but do you really think that it’s possible to tear his name down?  ‘Like do you truly believe they stand a chance? Relax and have peace.’  Taj, meanwhile, has been protesting that Michael – who died in 2009 – is innocent. He has claimed Robson is ‘100%’ lying about his allegations and accused Robson of ‘trying to make money’ from Jackson.  Taj said on the Victoria Derbyshire Show: ‘If you look at the timeline, which is what we’ve been trying to say to people, Wade was doing tribute shows after tribute shows, he even begged for the Cirque Du Soleil choreography job.  ‘Once the estate said no on that, he started secretly writing a book about his abuse and he shopped it around and nobody picked it up. A year later he comes out publicly with it. That’s in the deposition, that’s not just me saying it.  ‘I know Wade, and it bothered me a lot. I feel betrayed. I was the one who got Wade into my uncle’s memorial, I thanked Wade when he testified. I wish I could take all that back.’  Wade said he ‘doesn’t know’ Safechuck so couldn’t comment on his involvement in the documentary.  Leaving Neverland’s director Dan Reed has show his support for Robson and Safechuck and debunked suggestions they are lying. He also revealed the two men were never paid for their involvement and had no ‘financial interest’ in the documentary.  Got a showbiz story?<end_of_turn>

# Scorpion admires Groat as grandfather and broadcaster - Trib HSSN

Scorpion admires Groat as grandfather and broadcaster  By: Bill Beckner Jr.

 
						Friday, March 15, 2019  |  4:07 PM Dozens of Dick Groat stories have been shared in around Pitt basketball circles in the past few days since word surfaced that the longtime courtside broadcaster and sidekick to Bill Hillgrove was parting ways with the Panthers after 40 years.  Steve Scorpion knows those stories, and many more, only he has dealt with Groat from a much different perspective.  To Scorpion, the boys basketball coach at Franklin Regional, Groat is just grandpap.  Groat, 88, taught Scorpion some of the finer points of the game, from an analysts’s perspective. The pair would break down Pitt games for years.  Scorpion said Groat taught him how to play the game “the right way.”  “We’d read boxscores together and he’d always circle turnovers and offensive rebounds,” Scorpion said. “He always told me to be humble and always keep working hard.”  Scorpion said he is proud to be Groat’s grandson and of the legacy he left at Pitt.  “It’s really nice to hear so many people talk about how great of a person he is and how he would sit and hang out with anyone and tell stories with anyone who wanted to talk to him,” Scorpion said. “Even though he was such a big-time athlete he never once acted like he was better than anyone else. He loved broadcasting for Pitt basketball and loved all of the players there and that program and school. He really does love the game of basketball.”  Groat and Hillgrove worked Pitt games together for four decades.  Groat also has a relative on the PGA Tour. Three-time major winner Brooks Koepka is his great-nephew.  Bill Beckner Jr. is a Tribune-Review Staff Writer. You can contact Bill by email at bbeckner@tribweb.com or via Twitter .

# Century City Mall: Man With a Gun Reported on Friday Afternoon

A man with a gun was reported at the Century City mall in Los Angeles on Friday afternoon. However, the LAPD confirmed they found no evidence of a shooting or victims during their search, and had confirmed the establishment of a “unified command” at the mall by late afternoon.  The latest update by the LAPD at 3:15, pacific time, contained a statement by Sgt. Barry Montgomery:   “At 12:42 p.m., LAPD officers from West L.A. responded to the Westfield Mall for a reported ‘Man with a gun’ radio call. Upon officer’s arrival they observed numerous individuals running away from the location. Officers entered the mall attempting to locate the suspect. While conducting a search of the mall, officers met with a security [guard] who stated he hadn’t heard any gunshots or located any victims. While proceeding with their search, officers were directed to a suspicious package located inside the Amazon Store. In an abundance of caution LAPD Bomb Squad and LAFD responded to the scene. We are still in the process of evacuating those individuals who sheltered in place. A unified command has been established and we are working in partnership with LAFD to bring this incident to a peaceful ending.” Here is the original tweet by the LAPD on the incident: “LAPD West LA Division is responding to calls of an ‘Active Shooter’ at the Century City Mall. We have officers on scene who are clearing the location, but at this time we have NO evidence of a shooting or victims.”  Though there were no reports of shots fired or details confirmed from police at any point throughout the incident, there were several immediate reports of an active shooter by people on Twitter at the time, including some verified accounts.  Reporter Andrew Blankstein tweeted on Friday afternoon, “This is NOT considered an active shooter situation at Century City Mall. It is a REPORT of a man with a gun. There are NO reports of shots fired. No reports of injuries. No suspect(s) identified associated per LAPD/LAFD.”  But even celebrities were spreading active shooter claims on Twitter. Actress Rosanna Arquette wrote on Twitter, “Active shooter at century city mall.”  It’s common in fast-breaking active shooter situations for there to be conflicting, and even wrong, reports early on.  Here’s what you need to know:  LAPD Is Responding to Reports of a Man With a Gun; No ‘Active Shooter’ Report From Police  Per Fox Los Angeles, the incident was reported at 12:30, PST, outside of the outdoor shopping mall near Beverly Hills and Santa Monica in Los Angeles. There were several civilian reports of a large police presence, but no confirmation or reports of shots fired.  Here are some photos and videos taken by people at the scene of the incident:  Some people were actually locked inside of stores within the mall, as the video below shows:  One woman shared her experience on Twitter: “Stopped in at Clementine in Century City and couldn’t get the door to open. The owner came to the door and said they were in lockdown—a rumored shooting at Westfield Mall across the street…Just got update from someone inside a lockdown at Westfield Century City Mall and they are shaken but OK, although it is still a live situation and they are not able to leave yet. I really hope no one is hurt…”  A young woman tweeted, “A friend is in a holding area at  # Westfield  # CenturyCity  @ WestfieldCC where a man is armed. Possible active shooter. People injured from stampede evacuation. Helicopters and Police are at the scene. Retweet if in LA.” A woman named Joanna wrote, “There’s a shooter at CenturyCity Mall rn and I’m literally sitting in my office shaking and having a breakdown.”  Renaldo Wooldridge wrote on Twitter, “Century City Mall in LA has an active shooter. Anyone in the city, don’t go there right now. My brother is stuck inside. Prayers up”  The lockdown in Century City occurred less than a day after a mass shooting was reported in Christchurch, New Zealand, where dozens of people were killed in an apparent shooting spree by at least one man.  Another woman wrote, “So my niece is on lockdown at Bev Hills HS bc of an active shooter @ Century City mall. When does this end?”  It’s not the first time the mall has had a scare. In 2015, armed suspects with assault rifles robbed the Rolex store at the mall.<end_of_turn>

# New Zealand terrorist calls Indians 'invaders' in manifesto, names 'potential nation enemies in the East'

Christchurch: Brenton Tarrant, the 28-year-old main suspect in the Christchurch terror attack in New Zealand that claimed 49 lives, had apparently an aversion for immigrants, including from India, according to a "manifesto" received by the Prime Minister`s Office there.  The manifesto from the gunman, the New Zealand Prime Minister`s office said on Saturday, was received -- along with about 70 other recipients -- barely 10 minutes before the attacks began at the two Christchurch mosques on Friday.  Denouncing immigrants, the manifesto dubs them as "invaders", and talks about an invasion from India, along with China and Turkey. Tarrant also describes these countries as "potential nation enemies in the East".  Other politicians on the mailing list included National leader Simon Bridges and Parliament Speaker Trevor Mallard, The New Zealand Herald reported.  Most of the other recipients in the email were the media, both domestic and international, a spokesman for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. He added that the gunman did not say in the email that "this is what I am about to do" so "there was no opportunity to stop it".  "It does not set out what he was about to do. It was written as if it had occurred, to explain what obviously was about to play out," an official said.  The email had gone to Ardern`s generic address. The spokesman said that it was an email account managed by Ardern`s office and not her personal one.  According to the report, the person in the Prime Minister`s Office who opened the email followed standard procedure and referred it to Parliamentary security. Security then referred it to the police.<end_of_turn>

# Everton vs Chelsea: 3 key battles that hold key to the match

Everton vs Chelsea: 3 key battles that hold key to the match  Sixth-placed Premier League side Chelsea will travel to Goodison Park to play Everton on Sunday in a vital clash in the race for Champions League football next season. With Manchester United and Arsenal not playing this week, Maurizio Sarri's men have a golden chance to climb into the Champions League positions. Everton comes into this game on the back of a narrow 3-2 loss to Newcastle United at Tyneside and will be looking to get a win against Chelsea and get their campaign back on track. However, this looks improbable as the Toffees have not won against the Blues in their last six meeting and last tasted victory against them in March 2016. What is a matter of further embarrassment is that in four of those last six meetings, Everton had failed to score a single goal. However, a resurgence in the form of Brazilian Richarlison and the ever Dependable Gylfi Sigurdsson could mean that Marco Silva's men prove threatening to Chelsea on Sunday. We pick out three crucial battles which will decide where this game goes. #3 Richarlison vs Emerson Brazilian wonderkid Richarlison hit the Premier League running at the start of the season but has hit a loss in form lately. He redeemed himself against Newcastle when he a scored goal from close range and gave some hope to his team. On Sunday, Richarlison will be up against Emerson who has replaced first-choice left-back Marcos Alonso over the last few weeks. Although he has started only three games so far in the Premier League, Emerson will not give Richarlison space to roam freely and act upon every tiny error made by him. It will be a good contest between the two and stopping him will be Chelsea's biggest task of the day.<end_of_turn>

# Happiness is back for Real as Zidane gets winning return

Happiness is back for Real as Zidane gets winning return After a topsy-turvy campaign and a “tragic” week which saw their hopes of any silverware disappear, Real Madrid were all smiles again at the Bernabeu after Zinedine Zidane’s return as coach was celebrated with a 2-0 victory over Celta Vigo on Saturday.  “Happiness has returned to the dressing room and that’s the most important thing,” Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas told reporters. 
“The past is the past, the group is working well. I don’t know if we needed a change or not but the club thought it was necessary. 
“Zidane has spoken to each one of individually and now we need to be professionals and work hard.” Isco gave Real a deserved lead in the second half in the Madrid sunshine and Gareth Bale further raised spirits by sealing victory later in the game. 
Along with Isco and defender Marcelo, the Costa Rican Navas was one of the main beneficiaries of Zidane’s return 10 months after the Frenchman had walked out on the club having won an unprecedented three consecutive Champions League crowns. 
Navas, Real’s No. 1 in each of those triumphs, had been relegated to second choice with the signing of Thibaut Courtois and had made only three league starts before getting the nod ahead of the Belgian against Celta. 
“I had not played for a very long time so I’m happy, we’ll see what happens in the future,” Navas added. 
“The most important thing is I worked very hard to get an opportunity and today I got one.” Real defender Alvaro Odriozola also spoke of a change in atmosphere with the return of Zidane, who is Real’s third coach of the season after the sacking of Julen Lopetegui in October and Santiago Solari last Monday. 
Solari won his final game in charge of Real last week at Valladolid but his fate had already been sealed by two defeats to Barcelona and the humiliating 4-1 loss to Ajax Amsterdam which ended the team’s iron grip on the Champions League. 
“We are all very excited, we have renewed hope after that tragic week,” said Odriozola. 
“We have to look to the future, end this season with honour and try to win the remaining 10 games. We have to stay focused on competing and not thinking about who is playing or who isn’t. Instead, we all need to give 100 per cent.” Midfielder Dani Ceballos added: “It looks like us changing our coach worked. We have recovered some of the emotions we had lost and we have got the three points. Now our objective is to win all the games left and finish the season as well as possible.” – REUTERS<end_of_turn>

The gathering will take place 7 p.m. at the northeast lawn of Lake Eola, near Robinson and Eola streets, according to a summary of the event posted on Facebook. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and State Attorney Aramis Ayala are expected to speak. Brandon Wolf, a survivor of the Pulse shooting, and Christine Leinonen, whose son Drew was killed at Pulse, are also expected to attend.

# Video Of St. Cloud Mall Stabbings Released, FBI Calls Attack 'Premeditated' [VIDEO]

Video Of St. Cloud Mall Stabbings Released, FBI Calls Attack ‘Premeditated’ [VIDEO]  ST. CLOUD - Federal and local officials have taken the unusual step of releasing video footage from the St. Cloud Crossroads Mall stabbings. The incident on Saturday, September 17th left 10 people hurt, and the suspect Dahir Adan dead. Stearns County Attorney Janelle Kendall says at a news conference Thursday showing the video at this time in the investigation is something they would not normally do, but in the interest of transparency they decided to go ahead and release the video footage. Also, Special Agent with the FBI Rick Thornton says Adan may have become radicalized recently and that the attack likely was premeditated. He says Adan 'went from being a high achieving student with a lot of friends, to being withdrawn and flunking out of college almost overnight'. Adan took interest recently in Islam, and encouraged his female relatives to be more religious. Investigators were told that said Adan yelled "Islam, Islam" and "allahu akbar" during the attack. They've interviewed at least 180 people in their investigation. The FBI also continues to review Dahir Adan's electronic devices, however his iphone is locked and they haven't gotten access to his cell phone yet. Meanwhile, the attorney for the family of Adan says his relatives had no idea he expressed interest in Islam and was planning last month's attack as authorities have indicated. Abdulwahid Osman says the family did not see a change in Adan's behavior as investigators have claimed. Adan's parents and other close family members viewed video evidence from the mall attack earlier Thursday. Adan's parents said that is "not the son they knew" and that it is beyond their understanding that he committed the crime. Adan texted his boss at about 6:45 p.m. that night and said he could not make it in work. At 8:07 p.m. he left his home enroute to the mall. He was involved in a hit and run with a bicyclist on his way to the mall. He arrived at the Crossroads Center parking lot at about 8:13 p.m. The first 911 call came in at 8:14 p.m. Kendall says her role is to determine if the use of deadly force was necessary by part-time Avon police officer Jason Falconer. She says no criminal action will be filed against officer Falconer. The attacks started outside the mall near Complete Nutrition, then Dahir Adan continued inside the mall toward Target and Macy's. Adan, armed with two steak knives, ran into Macy's followed by Falconer. Twelve witnesses say they heard Falconer order Adan to drop his weapons. A total of 10 rounds were fired by Falconer with six striking Adan. St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis says we should continue to remember the victims of the mall stabbings. He says he's had a chance to speak to each of the 10 victims. Thirteen different agencies - 126 different people - responded to the Crossroads mall that night. Ninety-five separate 911 calls were made regarding the mall stabbings incident. The case is completely in the hands of the FBI now. The role of the St. Cloud Police Department and the Stearns County Attorney's Office is complete.<end_of_turn>

# Dreams come true as Paradise and Corning High baseball teams play at Oracle Park

SAN FRANCISCO — Paradise High catcher Nicholas Baker entered Saturday with a mindset knowing he would be squatting where one of baseball’s best catchers resides.  “I got some big shoes to fill,” Baker said, referring to Giants catcher Buster Posey.  In the top of the fourth inning, after Baker struck out in his previous at-bat, a pop up off the bat of a Corning player allowed Baker to emulate the Giants catcher. Baker flipped off his mask, turned around and caught a ball just before the fence behind home plate for the out.  “Wow, I’ve seen Buster do that quite often,” Baker said. “I had a bad at-bat and I made a play just like Buster. It’s just a dream come true.”  Many dreams came true for the Paradise High baseball team when it arrived at Oracle Park to play Corning High Saturday.  Prior to the game, Posey even had a message for the Bobcats as they huddled up in left field pregame. After introductions, the message played over the Giants’ public address system.  “Welcome Paradise and Corning High School to Oracle Park,” Posey said in a message recorded from the Giants’ spring training facility in Scottsdale, Arizona. “I know you guys are gonna have a great time. Paradise, we know that you’ve been through a lot and I’m sure its gonna be a long road to recovery but I just want you to know that the players are with you, the Giants community is with you and we wish you all the best. I hope you guys have a great time.”  It was the Bobcats’ fourth game in three days, but head coach Bryson Baker said there were two things he wanted to accomplish: 1. getting all 21 of his players a chance to step inside the batter’s box of a Major League stadium and 2. getting all of his senior pitchers a chance on the mound that so many of their heroes had once stepped foot on.  Saturday’s exhibition between Paradise and Corning finished with a 7-2 Cardinals victory; however, the final score between the two Westside League rivals was of least importance. “I didn’t care if we won or lost,” Bryson Baker said. “We play them two more times in league. I wanted them to have the experience of playing on a Major League Baseball field.”  For the players, who arrived on a chartered bus provided by the Giants, the three-hour drive consisted of team sing-a-longs to “Sweet Home Alabama” and other tracks.  “I was just looking forward to varsity year and now I feel like I’m an actual MLB player,” said Paradise starting center fielder Trent Branson. “Once we saw the outside of the stadium, we immediately started shaking, like ‘Wow this is really happening.’”  Then the game started.  Paradise senior Ryan Branson started on the mound for the Bobcats tossing to fellow senior Nicholas Baker.   Paradise starting pitcher Ryan Branson and catcher Nicholas Baker.

Since the Camp Fire, the two have been living in separate homes with friends, away from their parents. They see their parents once a week, who live in Sterling City, roughly 45 minutes away from Chico.  “Just seeing him out there motivates me,” Ryan Branson said. “And I hope me out there does the same for him.”  The fans  The Paradise, Corning, Chico and surrounding areas were out in full support Saturday.  As of Thursday, Paradise Athletic Director Anne Sterns said the school had sold out of the first 200 tickets. The Giants expected roughly 400 but at the end of the game, the total attendance was announced at 650 people.  The crowd ranged from parents to best friends, to former coaches, classmates, administrators, to simply people who said, “We have kids in the district and we support everything Paradise.”  Ryan Branson’s best friend Lleyton Rice, a senior on the Paradise High basketball team who grew up playing little league with much of the team, was in attendance.  “I’m excited to watch him,” Rice said. “It’s really cool because he’s starting pitching too. I’ve had this on my calendar for a while.”  Rice wasn’t the only fan cheering on Branson, as the Branson family brought roughly 10 people, including cousins and aunts from southern California.  Jennifer Branson, the mother of Ryan and Trent, was in tears as she walked through the gates of Oracle Park and saw her son on the mound.  “Super emotional. Just being with our baseball family is huge,” she said. “I’m just super grateful and happy that they wanted to stick with this, all of them. After going through so much, everyone of those kids has a story and I’m just proud of all of them.”  Several other fans included former Chico Heat coach Ryan Lauer, Paradise Unified School District School Board President Mike Greer and Vice President of the Board of Trustees Melissa Crick. Both were out supporting their local community, as Crick said, “Paradise is a big small town. Everyone knows everyone.”  The Game  Umpire Steve Graves was the crew chief Saturday, a 30-plus year veteran umpire who has umpired games at the professional level, including Sacramento Rivercats and Chico Heat games.  Graves, a former Paradise resident who lost his home in the Camp Fire, was joined by his sons Kyle Graves and David Kechloian and friend Mike Hart, who also lost his home in the fire.  Senior Trevor Rickson collected the first hit for Paradise on a single up the middle, while Ryan Branson scored the first run for the Bobcats. Branson scored from third after a delayed steal by the runner at first base that confused the Corning defense.  While several defensive mishaps were made, offense was limited in Oracle Park that features a 421-foot fence in right center and a daunting McCovey Cove in right. With an outfield playing deep majority of the game, two hitters, one from each team, were able to clear the head of an outstretched fielder.  Corning’s Jake Alexander hit a fly ball over a diving Paradise centerfielder that scored two runs and landed Alexander at third with a triple.  In the final inning, Paradise junior Noel Wagner hit a ball over the left fielder’s head resulting in a triple of his own.  “It’s great for those guys, especially cause they’re not playing all that much,” Bryson Baker said. “It’s the greatest feeling in the world.”  The score  Corning 7, Paradise 2  Up next: Paradise at Hamilton, 4 p.m., Tuesday; Corning at Oroville tournament, Thursday.<end_of_turn>

# Indian rupee at over seven-month highs; further gains likely

Mumbai: The Indian rupee rose to its highest in more than seven months on Monday, boosted by strong dollar inflows while broad weakness in the U.S. currency over the previous week also aided sentiment.  The partially convertible rupee was trading at 68.65/66 per dollar after touching 68.62, its strongest level since August 9. It had closed at at 69.10 on Friday.  The dollar licked its wounds after soft U.S. data increased bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this year while the pound hovered near nine-months high on hopes for a delay in Britain`s exit from the European Union.  Other Asian units, however, were trading mixed against the dollar.  "We have seen large (dollar) inflows in the last few days hitting the market. USDINR swap window followed by lower trade deficit added to INR strength," said Paresh Nayar, head of trading desk at First Rand Bank in Mumbai.  Investors are bullish on the Indian rupee for the first time in nearly a year, a Reuters poll showed last week, as a recent surge in popularity of the country`s ruling party is expected to bode well for its alliance in the upcoming national elections.  Foreign inflows into Indian equities and debt markets have surged, with $3.65 billion pouring in this month as of March 15. That compares with inflows of $1.58 billion in February and $788 million outflows in January, according to exchange data.  "I don`t think many would have expected such sharp appreciation with the RBI not intervening aggressively and with inflows still lined up, the next support is 68.50," Nayar said.  In a bid to mop up dollars and pump in rupees, the central bank last Wednesday said it would conduct its first dollar/rupee buy-sell swap auction on March 26.  The RBI plans to swap rupees for dollars for a total fo $5 billion with domestic banks which is likely to help achieve its twin objectives of pushing interest rates down while also preventing a sharp appreciation in the rupee.<end_of_turn>

# Former Temple Football standout fine tunes skills before NFL draft

NFL scouts often ask Ryquell Armstead: “Can you catch the ball?”  At Temple’s Pro Day on Monday with more than 60 scouts in attendance, the Owls’ former running back wanted to prove himself as a complete running back.  He showed them he can produce on the field as a rusher, finishing his Temple University career in 2018 fourth all-time in rushing yards and third in rushing touchdowns and following it with a strong showing at the NFL Scouting Combine.  But scouts are often hesitant of his ability to catch the ball out of the backfield because he wasn’t utilized as a receiver at Temple, Armstead said.  Despite having an effective career as the Owls’ running back, Armstead has not been a highly regarded prospect for next month’s NFL Draft. Armstead is the 21st-best running back prospect, according to CBS Sports.  Armstead looked to improve his draft stock with a strong performance at Pro Day on Monday.  He emphasized pass-catching drills to impress scouts on Monday. He didn’t drop a single pass while running a variety of routes. On one play, Armstead made a difficult running catch on an underthrown pass deep down the field.  In four seasons at Temple, Armstead ran for 2,812 yards and scored 34 rushing touchdowns. But he only had 29 career receptions in 47 games at Temple.  On Monday, Philadelphia Eagles running backs coach Duce Staley worked with Armstead and former Temple fullbacks Rob Ritrovato and Nick Sharga. Staley and Armstead talked individually before the drills started.  Eagles vice president of player personnel Joe Douglas and another Eagles representative talked to Armstead following the conclusion of the running back drills.  Armstead, who is from Millville, New Jersey, said he is aware of the Eagles’ tendency to sign young running backs from the Philadelphia region. During the past two offseasons, the Eagles signed Glassboro, New Jersey, native Corey Clement and Warrington, Pennsylvania, native Josh Adams.  “[Staley] is a great coach, I love what he was saying to me,” Armstead said. “Small details and what really matters. All in all, I feel like I had a good day, I feel like he likes me. It was great working out with the Eagles.”  Armstead has a “workout” with the Chicago Bears on Tuesday, he said.  Armstead skipped the 40-yard dash, broad jump or bench press on Monday because he tested in them at the NFL combine on March 1. Armstead ran a 4.45-second 40-yard dash, the second-fastest time of any running back at the combine.  Armstead said he prepares for Temple’s Pro Day the same way he preps for bigger events like the Senior Bowl and the NFL Combine, at which hundreds of NFL representatives are scouting athletes.  “The combine and senior bowl were bigger than this but prep doesn’t change, it’s like I said you have to have confidence in yourself,” Armstead said. “Confidence will take you a long way.”  Armstead hopes to be the first Temple running back drafted since Bernard Pierce in 2012. With the NFL Draft about five weeks away, Armstead will continue to condition and work out for teams, hoping to hear his name during the three-day draft, which starts on April 25.  “I am very confident catching the ball, running drills,” he added. “So they asked me to do what I do, that’s my abilities and showcase what I have.”<end_of_turn>

# Connecticut School Employee Resigns After Racist Viral Video

Connecticut School Employee Resigns After Racist Grocery Store Video Goes Viral  Corinne Terrone has been separated from employment effective immediately.  A Connecticut resident has resigned from her position at the Hamden Public School District after a video posted to Facebook shows her using racial slurs and spitting on two black people while at a local Shop Rite.  According to The New Haven Register, Corinne Terrone who was a clerk in the district's central office, is seen with her two children when the confrontation erupts. Terrone uses the N-Word three times and spits at a black man and black woman. It's unclear how the clash begins.  After Terrone's first use of the slur, the man on video rushes toward Terrone as she attempts to take her phone out and record. “Put your hands on me, come on!” she says. He then slaps the phone out of her hand. That's the only physical encounter between the two caught on video.  The Facebook post, which has received more than 180,000 views, overwhelmingly supported the black man and woman. A spokesman for the school wrote on the district's website that Terrone "has been separated from employment effective immediately.”  “While it appears as though this happened after work hours on Friday evening, the Human Resource Director contacted the employee and arranged an investigatory meeting with her. Shortly after final arrangements were made for the investigatory meeting, the employee rendered her resignation effective immediately.”  Due to the fact that Terrone's children were present during the verbal assault, the district filed a report with DCF services.  Republican State Sen. Len Fasano and state Rep. Joseph Zullo released a joint statement condemning Terrone's language and behavior.  “What we saw in this video is repulsive and deeply offensive and does not represent the people of East Haven or our values. The behavior is shocking and upsetting and has no place anywhere, including in our community,” Fasano and Zullo said in the statement. “We understand Hamden Public Schools has acted quickly to seek this employee’s resignation. East Haven police are also seeking more information and urging any potential victims or witnesses involved to come forward. Hate speech and violence will not be tolerated in our community.”<end_of_turn>

# Can Ghana become self-sufficient in rice production? - Ghanaian Times

The consumption of rice in Ghana, today can be compared to traditional foods such as fufu, kenkey, akple and gari.  In urban centres in particular, rice consumption has increased to the point that local production is unable to meet demand.  Consequently, about 70 per cent of the rice consumed, which is estimated at about US$1 billion dollars annually, is imported.  According to experts, Ghana is capable of producing more than 300,000 tonnes of rice, given the favourable ecological conditions of the country.  It therefore goes without saying that, Ghana has a great potential to expand its present output if its vast lands and swamps are efficiently exploited. The experts say that, currently, less than 10 per cent of the potentially suitable lands for production of rice are being exploited.  The Ghanaian Times finds it unacceptable that the country’s huge potential to produce rice locally, is left unexploited while importation of the now staple food continues to increase import bill to absurd levels.  We are of the view that it is time for the government to accord high priority to the development of the rice production sector as part of food security strategy of the country.  Deliberate and systematic development of the sector offers tremendous opportunities for the country to cut down imports and reduce foreign exchange spent annually.  It would also be a good prospect to provide sustainable jobs for the youth in the rural areas.  That is why we are happy that the government has initiated moves under the flagship of Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) programme to boost rice production.  The initiative is expected to propel Ghana to become self-sufficient in rice production by the year 2025.  We understand that the plan by the government is to scale-up rice production in 122 selected districts already actively involved in rice production from this year.  An initial target of producing over 700,000 metric tonnes on 233,000 hectares of land has been set with an expected increase in yields every year to reduce and possibly halt rice importation by 2025.  We are happy that such an initiative is being undertaken to reduce the country’s rice import bill, which no doubt, has a drain on the economy.  As Ghanaians, we must all come to the appreciation that nation building, particularly economic growth can be achieved only through such policies which create jobs, improve livelihoods and endorses food security.  We cannot allow the initiative on rice cultivation and production to pale into insignificance like others before it, when it presents an opportunity for food security.  The Ghanaian Times calls on stakeholders in the rice cultivation and production value chain to provide the needed support to make this initiative a success.<end_of_turn>

# Savills drops venerable Studley name from its brand

One of the city’s fabled real estate names just disappeared — but it’s due to success, not failure.  Savills Studley Inc. is now simply Savills Inc., dropping a name that’s been synonymous with commercial tenant representation for 65 years. The rebranding reflects how well the firm has done since London-based Savills plc bought the New York tenant-rep firm, founded by industry legend Julien J. Studley, in 2014.  “Since the acquisition in May of 2014, we grew over 55 percent in revenue in America,” said North American Chairman and CEO Mitchell Steir. “We have over 800 employees in the US,” up from 575 in 2014.  The firm grew across the US not only because business is strong, but to meet the needs of a changed leasing world.  “The business gets ever more sophisticated with each succeeding year,” Steir said. “Twenty years ago, you had maybe a broker and a consultant. Today, multidisciplinary teams are required to service major users.  “We have specialists in labor analytics, incentives, occupancy experience, project management — clients expect all those services from a single provider,” Steir said.  “What we’re really doing with name change is to signal that we now seamlessly deliver the same tier-1 advice, services and solutions that Savills does throughout the world,” Steir added.  But there’s an important distinction. Savills Inc. will be unique in the Savills plc universe — it remains strictly a tenants’ rep firm in the US, unlike the parent company, which works for both landlords and tenants everywhere else.  Steir joined Studley in 1988 and brokered some of the era’s most transformative leases, including Time Warner’s move to Related Companies’ project at Columbus Circle and law firm Jones Day’s relocation from the Grand Central area to Downtown’s Brookfield Place in 2013.  At the time, current Savills US President Mitch Rudin was Brookfield Properties’ CEO of American commercial operations. He joined Savills Studley on Jan. 1 this year.  Steirs led a management buyout of the Studley firm in 2002, and became CEO the same year. Savills bought the privately held company in 2014, marking its entry into the US market. Savills plc is 160 years old and is traded on the London Stock Exchange. It boasts more than 660 offices in 71 countries worldwide.  Rudin said, “The other Mitch is too modest to say this, but I can say it — the transformation he took this company through in the US is extraordinary. He changed the entire headquarters team and it’s all working seamlessly.”  Steir recalls Julien Studley as a “colorful character who stood for excellence. That’s why we held onto the name, to give Savills time to socialize in the US,” he said.  Studley and his family fled Belgium when the Nazis invaded in 1940. He tricked the Germans by putting a Boy Scout patch on the car which “they thought was a pass” to enter France, he told the Real Deal in 2008. They next made it to Cuba and finally to New York.  The young Studley founded his brokerage in 1954 and established itself as the only major firm that represented tenants only. 
Today, there are younger brokers who barely heard of Studley — but none who need to ask what Savills is.<end_of_turn>

# Michigan House backs highway designation for Aretha Franklin

LANSING, Mich. — In a sign of R-E-S-P-E-C-T, the Michigan Legislature is expected to honor the late Queen of Soul with a highway designation.  The Michigan House voted 101-6 on Tuesday to designate a portion of M-10 in Detroit as the "Aretha L. Franklin Memorial Highway." Franklin died in Detroit last year after battling pancreatic cancer.  The legislation will next go to the state Senate.  Supporters say dedicating a portion of the highway is an appropriate way to honor the musical and cultural icon, who grew up in Detroit and learned the gospel fundamentals at New Bethel Baptist Church.  The sponsor, Democratic Rep. Leslie Love of Detroit, says Franklin was a "special lady" who fought for civil rights and "gave us all a soundtrack to our lives."<end_of_turn>

# Dan Fagan: Concerned mom used social media -- then went to jail for it

When government officials abuse power, they must be held accountable. But apparently, that’s not happening with the well-publicized and inexcusable arrest of an Acadiana mother last month. An officer with the Scott Police Department arrested Maegan Adkins-Barras, 32, of Broussard, on Feb. 20. Adkins-Barras posted a video on Facebook that her 14-year old son took of a fight at his school, Acadiana High. Police asked Adkins-Barras to come to her son’s school the day after the fight. They told her they wanted to question her son about the video he shot, and that she needed to be there. "When I got there, I realized they weren't questioning my son," Adkins-Barras said. "They already had the arrest affidavit, and they read me my rights.” Police told Adkins-Barras she was charged with ”unlawful posting of criminal activity for notoriety and publicity.” They handcuffed her right in front of everyone at her son’s school, and off she went in the back of a cop car to the Lafayette Parish Correctional Center. "Right when I got there, they made me put on the orange jumpsuit. And I asked why, and they said I wouldn't have a bond until later. I kept asking why I couldn't get a bond. I didn't want to go upstairs. I had a mattress on the floor. All night long, that's what I had,” said Adkins-Barras. Her kids stayed with relatives while their mother spent the night in jail. "My little ones told me they saw the news and were scared I was going to stay in jail forever," she said. There is a Louisiana law prohibiting those committing a crime from posting it on social media for fame or financial gain. This was clearly not the case with Adkins-Barras. “The spirit and the letter of the offense require the person to be charged to be either a principal or accessory to the crime contained in the images obtained by an image recording device," District Attorney Keith Stutes said in explaining why he dropped the charges against Adkins-Barras. Scott Police Chief Chad Leger obviously didn’t understand the law. He posted this on the department’s Facebook page after the arrest: "Posting videos and photos of illegal activity on social media is against the law in the State of Louisiana. Violators of the law could be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both.” Adkins-Barras has hired an attorney and says she may sue. It’s understandable considering the unapologetic and seemingly unrepentant Leger, who still refuses to answer questions about the arrest — although he did tell The Advocate he isn’t concerned about a lawsuit. “Anybody can sue anybody for anything these days. Is it something that concerns me? No. Is it something that can happen? Yes.” This ordeal was especially traumatic for the 32-year old mother because her husband, Joshua Barras, tried to hang himself in the very same jail just four months prior to her stay there. The incident left him in a vegetative state. Joshua was in jail for illegal possession of the prescription drug Xanax when he tried to kill himself. Adkins-Barras says she posted the video because it showed one of the kids fighting hit his head on the concrete. "I posted it as a concerned parent because of my son and my husband," Adkins-Barras said. "That could have been my child.” The mother of one the kids in the fight video thanked Adkins-Barras for posting it. "She had no idea how hard he'd hit his head until she saw it, and she took him to another doctor the next day," Adkins-Barras said. Adkins-Barras did nothing wrong. Her night in jail was unjust and a clear case of abuse of power. Someone must be held accountable. And yet a full month after the fact, the mother of three has yet to receive as much as an apology.

# Japan's Sunwolves set for Super Rugby axe: report

Japan's Sunwolves set for Super Rugby axe: report  Facing the axe? Sunwolves players huddle before taking on the Auckland Blues earlier this month  Japan's ground-breaking Sunwolves team are set to be axed from Super Rugby, a report said on Wednesday, as the governing body prepared to make an announcement about the competition's future.  Sydney's Daily Telegraph said the Sunwolves would be sacrificed as the 15-team, globe-crossing tournament reverts to 14 sides and a round-robin format, ditching its unpopular conference system.  The unsourced report came as governing body SANZAAR (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) said it would make a statement on the "future of Super Rugby" on Friday.  The Telegraph said Sunwolves officials and players were told about the decision on Tuesday, leaving them "devastated".  A spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based team told AFP: "We are still waiting for Friday's official announcement and at this stage have no comment to make."  The Sunwolves' introduction in 2016 was part of attempts to expand the game in Asia, which will host its first Rugby World Cup in Japan later this year.  Much of the opposition to Asia's first Super Rugby outfit came from South Africa, the Telegraph said, adding that its teams were opposed to travelling to Tokyo and Singapore for the Sunwolves' home games.  "All of the participating nations in Super Rugby have been financially propping up the Sunwolves in the hopes of luring more revenue from the untapped Asian market," the report said.  "It had been hoped that after two or three seasons, cashed up Japanese companies would back the Sunwolves and make them independently sustainable, but that has not materialised."  While the Sunwolves' record on the pitch is poor, they have gradually improved and enjoyed their first away win when they shocked the Waikato Chiefs 30-15 earlier this month.  Super Rugby shrank from 18 teams to 15 in 2018, dropping two teams from South Africa and one from Australia in an attempt to streamline.  But it retained the country-based conference system which has been criticised for its complexity and for giving an easier ride to teams from weaker regions.

# Ethiopia: UAE Companies Exploring Investment Opportunities in Ethiopia

Addis Ababa — Delegates from more than 80 UAE anchor companies are taking part in the Ethiopia-UAE business forum in Addis Ababa to explore available investment opportunities.  UAE companies are choosing Ethiopia for investment as their country puts the Horn African nation among the top destinations for UAE investment.  Undersecretary for Foreign Trade at UAE Ministry of Economy, Abdulla Ahmed Al Saleh told journalists that Ethiopia is one of the four most important countries for UAE investment in Africa.  There are several UAE companies that are investing in Ethiopia for years; he stated, and added "we would like to increase the level of investment."  "We have other companies to do business more in Ethiopia in different sector, especially in agriculture, real estate development, hospitality, industrial sector," the Undersecretary said.  A forum and exhibition will open on March 21, 2019, which Abdulla Saleh said will provide the opportunity for UAE and Ethiopia business people.  The trade relation between the two countries has been growing. The total trade turnover has increased from 809 million USD in 2012 to 850 million USD currently.  However, Undersecretary stated the need to enhance the trade relation by highly engaging the business community of the two countries.  "We would like to increase for the next few years to double this number and it is easy to do that by introducing the business communities to each other."  He said Ethiopia's population - more than 100 million - is a huge market opportunity for investors from UAE to come and establish manufacturing companies.  Permanent Secretary of Economic Affairs at Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Dewano Kedir said that the forum is pursuant to the decision of leaders of both countries to strengthen bilateral ties.  "Many UAE investors are flowing to Ethiopia as they have put the country at the top of their investment choice due to many criteria," he added.  Stating that there are over 50 UAE companies in Ethiopia to date, Ambassador Dewano said "the government will provide all the necessary support companies".<end_of_turn>

# GP Solutions Partners with Soilless Science Solutions to Create Premier Brand of "Living Soils"

GP Solutions Partners with Soilless Science Solutions to Create Premier Brand of "Living Soils" GP Solutions Partners with Soilless Science Solutions to Create Premier Brand of "Living Soils" 

  
       
  
   Product line will heighten company's presence in $262 billion organic food market CORONA, Calif., March 19, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- GP Solutions (OTC:GWPD), owner of Grow Pod Solutions, a leading developer of modular automated micro-farms, has partnered with Soilless Science Solutions to create a proprietary lineup of premium "living soils."  These unique soil-less mediums contain no native soil. The mixtures contain beneficial microorganisms that form the foundation of highly active "living soils" that will produce abundant, healthy crops of all types.  Soil mixtures will be developed for a variety of crops - each with its own unique composition.  Additionally, the company will be pursuing registration for organic crop production.  The mixtures are plant-based, with no animal products. Compare this to other products that use animal waste, which inherently contain harmful pathogens and bacteria, and can contaminate crops and potentially cause widespread illness.  As the public becomes more aware of the dangers of traditional farming and the potential harm from "dirty" soil, consumers will start demanding their food is grown in clean environments using "healthy" soils.  GP Solutions will be providing this proprietary soil-less mixture to customers of GrowPod™ automated farms, as well as to the general public within the near future.  GrowPod™, by GP Solutions, is a modular and stackable indoor micro-farm that grows clean produce in a controlled environment. With specialized air and water filtration along with its proprietary "living soil" blends, the GrowPod™ system can produce some of the highest quality fruits, herbs and vegetables in the world.  "The traditional approach was to add chemicals, fertilizers, weed killers and other dangerous additives to soil and crops," said George Natzic, President of GP Solutions. "Today, we know this can be very harmful. I'm proud that GP Solutions is on the forefront of developing new, clean cultivation systems and products," he added. "This is a dawning of a new era in agriculture."  For information, visit: www.growpodsolutions.com, or call (855) 247-8054.

# With upset alert in air, Self’s past helps him try to brace KU against first-round farewell

From about the instant Kansas was assigned a No. 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament Midwest Regional and aligned with Northeastern for its first-round game on Thursday at Vivint Smart Home Arena, KU became a fashionable upset candidate.  The ever-astute likes of ESPN analyst Jay Bilas (“Kansas may not get past Northeastern,” he said during the bracket selection show) and the Sporting News’ Mike DeCourcy (Northeastern is his sleeper pick for the region) questioned taking a KU win for granted, and basketball pundits from around the nation have scrawled in a Kansas loss.  And it’s natural enough to scoff at a team that took a long time to meld, suffered lapses even since seeming to coalesce (see: Texas Tech and Oklahoma in the last month and Iowa State in the last game), will start five players who’ve never played in an NCAA Tournament … and will be matched against a veteran team that specializes in one of Kansas’ vulnerabilities, the three-point game.  This remains a volatile, vexing team. One that could as easily win twice here to get to the Sweet 16 in Kansas City — that’s what I’m putting in my bracket — as it could lose in the first round in its first game as a No. 4 seed since the 2006 opening loss to Bradley.  Sign Up and Save  Get six months of free digital access to The Kansas City Star  #ReadLocal  It’s actually pretty much like coach Bill Self put it after KU’s regular-season finale as he looked toward the postseason, referencing a movie: “It’s ‘50 First Dates.’ Drew Barrymore could star with our team ... because it’s something new every day. I don’t know what to expect, but I’m excited to see whatever happens.”  If you’re a Jayhawk fan, you might be indignant about the perceived lack of respect for a team that largely surged down the stretch as the freshman quartet of Devon Dotson, Quentin Grimes, Ochai Agbaji and David McCormack made strides and found their place and gelled.  If you’re Self, though, you appreciate that a clear and present danger always lurks in NCAA play. And that possibility is not to be dismissed but girded for and guarded against, especially when you’re not a 1 or 2 seed for the first time in a decade.  That perspective comes from a coaching lifetime of experiences, ranging from knowing what it’s like to be the overlooked other guy (Tulsa) to being on the wrong end of unfathomable upsets like Northern Iowa (9 vs. 1 in the second round in 2010), Bucknell (14-3 in 2005, KU’s first first-round loss in 27 years) and, of course, Bradley.  Whatever angst there was then about Self’s capacity to thrive at Kansas after his second straight first-round loss (something he’d never suffered before or since) has long since been refuted. You might even make the case that Bradley was the pivot point.  Consider the 2008 national title among three Final Fours, as well as four Elite Eights (to go with his three earlier ones) and the stunning streak of 14 straight Big 12 titles that ended this season.  Now, only seven men have more NCAA Tournament wins than Self, whose next victory will be his 48th and move him past legendary UCLA coach John Wooden. Sure, it’s a different era, but …  Self’s a Hall of Fame coach now, one of the most successful men ever to do this. Most of his players haven’t been here before, but he sure has. And this season to date has been one of his finest jobs whisking his team forward, particularly considering the loss of Udoka Azubuike, the oddities of Lagerald Vick and the lingering matter of the FBI’s Adidas investigation.  For all the success since 2006, Self has joked over the years that the very mention of Bucknell still makes him start twitching and Bradley doubtless remains emblazoned in his mind.  So he is on high alert as he tries to get his team mentally ready for Thursday, cognizant of the extra challenge inherent in having a squad dominated by players who’ve never had this experience.  “I think it’s pretty easy all week-long to be excited, to be enthusiastic, to have your mind in the right spot,” he said. “But then when you get down to absolute playing, (to not have or) feel that extra pressure and tense up, I think there is a balance. And experience does help with that.  “We are doing all we can to make sure our guys are as loose as they can be and it should be a reward to play in the tournament and to go on and have fun.”  Have fun, yes, but also take nothing for granted.  Because Self knows what it’s like to be on the “flip side,” to use one of his favorite terms, and have the chance to up against an elite program that may or may not be as locked in for one reason or another.  “Let’s just be totally candid and honest: When teams watch certain teams play on TV … like (when) we were at Tulsa, we got tired of seeing those schools and you could name every player one through eight, even their substitution patterns …” he said.  Noting that even mispronouncing the name of an opposing player on one of the less-glamorized teams can “light a fire more,” Self added, “So you come into a situation where obviously there’s mutual respect but there may be a bit more of a chip on somebody else’s shoulder and that is what you have to negate. It can’t mean more to one than it does to the other … (because) that is how upsets occur.”  Any chance of that also depends on the mindset of Northeastern, which lost 88-60 to then-No. 16 Virginia Tech in its only game against a ranked team this season and can be downright porous defensively.  And it’s not like any of the Huskies have played in an NCAA Tournament.  So as natural as it might be to wonder just where Kansas is headed, the same might be said for how Northeastern views KU.  “Certainly, I think it’s natural when you look at Kansas, and you look at the program and the history of that program to get overwhelmed,” coach Bill Coen said.  As Coen considered the opportunity of the moment, though, he said, “There’s a great saying: ‘Whether you think you can and whether you think you can’t, you’re right.’ Why not choose to believe?”  And as much as the burden of proof is on Northeastern to do the unexpected, Self knows it’s also on his team to be immersed in the moment to avoid allowing a trendy upset pick to come true.<end_of_turn>

# LAFC Acquires F Christian Ramirez from Minnesota United

Los Angeles FC Acquires F Christian Ramirez from Minnesota United LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles FC has acquired goal-scoring forward Christian Ramirez from Minnesota United FC. LAFC traded $550,000 in cash Monday night in a deal that includes a potential $200,000 more depending on future performances by Ramirez, the leading goal-scorer in Minnesota United's franchise history. Ramirez is a native of Garden Grove, California, who has been with Minnesota for five seasons. He stuck with the club during its rise from the NASL to MLS, and he scored the Loons' first MLS goal last season before finishing the season as its leading goal-scorer. Ramirez had an early-season slump this year but was still Minnesota's second-leading goal-scorer. He got two goals in the Loons' rout of LAFC last month, and he had three goals in three games before getting benched last weekend. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

# Road-link cash to be spent elsewhere

Cash for roads after Reading to Wokingham scheme scrapped  Funding earmarked for a travel route to connect two Berkshire boroughs will be used for road improvements instead after plans were scrapped. A Mass Rapid Transit between Reading and Wokingham was scrapped after councillors blocked the £20m proposals. Concerns were raised that the scheme would ruin a "lovely unspoilt area". It means cash has been released and plans have been put forward to build a £4m bridge in Barkham, Wokingham, in order to ease congestion. Councillors had said the plans looked "like a concrete jungle being dumped onto Wokingham Borough". As part of the new proposals, Berkshire Local Transport Body has allocated £4.3m towards building a new bridge alongside the existing crossover in Barkham by 2021. The two bridges would facilitate two-way traffic through the current bottleneck, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Currently, the existing bridge is only wide enough to support single-lane traffic and operates via a give-way system. Elsewhere, cash will be spent for a park and ride in the town and to increase spaces at Winnersh Triangle Park and Ride.<end_of_turn>

# South Africa: Mantsha's Appointment As Denel Board Chair Seen As Continuation of 'Takeover' - Saloojee

The judicial commission of inquiry into state capture has heard how the appointment of Daniel Mantsha in 2015 as chairperson of Denel, the state arms manufacturer, was a continuation of a "takeover" of the company.  This was the testimony of former Denel group CEO Riaz Saloojee before inquiry chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo.  Saloojee spent Wednesday dropping bombshell after bombshell about how he believed Denel was a target of state capture.  Saloojee said before the annual general meeting and the announcement of a new board in July 2015, the company's Zwelakhe Ntshepe informed him that Gupta associate Salim Essa wanted to meet with him so he could introduce him to the new chairperson of the board, Mantsha.  Saloojee told the inquiry that he was "perplexed" that Essa wanted to introduce him to the new chairperson of the board, given that Essa had also introduced him to the Guptas in the presence of then minister Malusi Gigaba, Duduzane Zuma, son of former president Jacob Zuma, and Ace Magashule's son.  He also told the commission that he then concluded that Mantsha and Essa had an "understanding".  'Old board supported me 100%'  He said while Mantsha assured him that things at Denel would be done the right way, he was still sceptical.  Saloojee testified that he knew that it was difficult for the Guptas or their business associate Essa to get rid of him while the "old board" was there.  "The old board had supported me a 100%," he said.  Saloojee also detailed how he and his colleagues were suspended over the acquisition of Land Systems SA from BAE Systems.  Saloojee told Zondo that he went away to a defence exhibition in London with then minister of public enterprises Lynne Brown.  He said while they were there, the new audit and risk committee was continuously asking the company secretary Elizabeth Africa for documents on the Land Systems deal.  He said while in London, Mantsha told him that the risk committee was unhappy with the conduct of the company secretary.  It was alleged that she did not give the committee all the documents of the Land system transaction.  Letter of suspension  Immediately after the London trip in September 2015, the three senior executives were called to a meeting with Denel's new audit and risk committee and were accused of serious misconduct relating to the Land System.  Saloojee said he and his colleagues, Africa and chief financial officer Fikile Mhlontlo were all individually called into meetings, presented with the list of allegations and given 24 hours to give reasons why they should not be suspended over the Land Systems transactions.  He said soon after this the committee informed them that it had considered their representations and that it had resolved that they should be offered a three-month package.  Saloojee said he received a letter from Mantsha confirming his suspension.  He claimed Mantsha told him that because he did not offer the committee his representations it had no choice but to suspend him.  "What he was saying was not true?" Zondo asked.  "Yes," Saloojee replied.  'Inexplicable'  He said they were then informed that Denel appointed Dentons law firm to conduct an investigation into the Land system transaction and on their conduct in that transaction.  Saloojee also read out parts of a letter which was signed by Mantsha, addressed to the company's acting secretary at the time.  In the letter, Mantsha asks the secretary to, "further requested to inform Dentons that their report is not accepted and request them to provide us with a report within 30 days and kindly direct them to provide information to support the charges".  "I mean this is inexplicable that the chairman of the board is asking the company secretary to ask Dentons to change the report and that the new report should support the charges against us," Saloojee testified.  "A chairman of the board who is also an officer of the court," evidence leader advocate Leah Gcabashe said.  City Press previously reported that there was speculation that the trio's removal was related to the controversial Denel Asia joint venture.  Mbalula ready to 'amplify the truth'  The hearings are expected to continue on Friday with evidence from the ANC's Fikile Mbalula.  Mbalula has vowed to "amplify the truth" when he testifies before Zondo, News24 previously reported.  "Everything that [former finance minister] Trevor Manuel said regarding head of elections about me is true, and it is now up to me to go to the state capture commission and amplify that truth and put it into context," Mbalula, who is the party's head of elections, said at the time.  Manuel previously testified that Mbalula had an emotional reaction during one of the party's national executive committee (NEC) meetings over an interaction he had with one of the Gupta brothers.  Manuel revealed that at the NEC meeting in August 2011, members had a tense discussion about the influence of the Guptas.  Manuel said Mbalula cried while talking about an engagement he had with one of the Gupta brothers in 2010. It was during this interaction that he was told that he would become minister of sports and recreation.  Source: News24<end_of_turn>

# Missouri man sentenced to 4 years for illegally having guns, committing perjury

CEDAR RAPIDS — A federal judge on Wednesday found a man committed perjury during his sentencing hearing and increased his prison time from nearly two years to four years in prison.  U.S. District Judge C.J. Williams said he didn’t find Damon Montano, 39, of Louisiana, Mo., to be credible when he testified a few weeks ago during the first part of his sentencing. But he did find Montano’s wife, who said he tried to strangle her and repeatedly beat her up throughout their marriage, credible when testified earlier this month.  Montano pleaded guilty in December to possession of firearms by a person convicted of domestic assault. He was convicted of domestic assault in 2007. According to evidence, he possessed three different firearms and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition last July while he and wife were camping or living at the Meskwaki casino’s RV park, according to court documents.  The domestic abuse charge originally filed in this case that involved his estranged wife was dismissed by the prosecution because there was jurisdiction issue but the court can consider the assault at sentencing.  Montano, during his statement to the court, wasn’t dissuaded by the judge’s perjury finding and blamed his wife for the abuse incidents, saying she was a “pathological liar.” He said she was the one who hit him and she would hit herself “all the time.” He called the woman “crazy and violent.”  Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Williams asked the court to vary upward in guideline sentencing to 63 months because he is a “true danger to society.” When Montano’s grandparents were going to commit him to a hospital for mental health issues in 2005, he threatened to burn down their home. He also turned off his grandmother’s supplemental oxygen and ripped out the phone line to prevent her from calling for help, she said.  The prosecutor also cited past incidents where Montano, with his fist, busted out a girlfriend’s car window, shattering pieces of glass into her face, and another woman said she had to attempt to leave him while he was showering to ensure her escape from him.  ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT  Judge Williams said Montano is a “dangerous and abusive” person who blames others, especially women, for what has happened to him. He pointed out that Montano assaulted another inmate in August over an argument about Bible verses while in jail pending sentencing.  The judge also ordered Montano to serve three years of supervised release following his prison time, and placed a no contact order, which prohibits Montano from contacting his estranged wife while on supervised release.  l Comments: (319) 398-8318; trish.mehaffey@thegazette.com<end_of_turn>

# Markham's massive Asian night market is coming back this summer

Markham's massive Asian night market is coming back this summer  Toronto's gigantic Asian night market is back for another year (yes, summer is real and actually coming, promise).  While some are already working on their beach bodies, others are beginning to plan out a summer of epic eats as the promise of food fests and trucks looms with temperatures daring to edge above zero.  This year's Night It Up! will feature over a hundred vendors, mostly Asian stalls from the likes of PanPan Noodle Bar and FormoCha, though there will be some standard Canadian offerings like Beavertails. Other Asian delights at the market will include takoyaki, Korean pancakes, bubble waffles, ramen burgers and BBQ lamb.  There are also live performances throughout the day all weekend long, as well as an inflatable obstacle course and double slide, a "sports zone" and game booths where prizes can be won.  Put on by Power Unit Youth Organization, a portion of proceeds from the event are annually donated to a charitable cause. Check out a laser maze, photobooth and VR headsets among other activities to support them.  The festival is taking place from July 12 to 14 at Markham Civic Centre.

# Fortnite Week 4 Challenges: How to search for buried treasure in Season 8

The challenges have finally arrived for Fortnite's Season 8, Week 4 Battle Pass - and there's some interesting stuff in there. One of the trickiest challenges this week revolves around locating and unearthing buried treasure in the map. To progress your Battle Pass as much as possible, you'll need to locate pirate-themed loot on the map. This week, you'll need to locate two pieces of treasure using a newly-introduced item in the Fornite universe. Here's Daily Star Online's guide to locating this hidden treasure - good luck and good hunting! Fortnite buried treasure - How to solve Season 8, Week 4 challenge First up, you need to equip the Treasure Map item. It will take one slot in your inventory. Once equipped, the item will show a few new locations on the map (marked in gold) and in the game world, too. Check out where this marker is and make your way towards it - you'll see a large black 'X marks the spot' marker on the map. From here, use your pickaxe and you'll be able to dig into the ground and uncover your shiny plunder - it will be full of Legendary tier loot. It's worth noting you don't need to have the map equipped to get the item - you can simply pick it up, make a note of the location and then run off to find it. If you're more a fan of video guides, you can check out Bull - Fortnite's video below.

# Suffolk County Historical Society building now accessible to all | Suffolk Times

Suffolk County Historical Society announced the opening of its new Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant wing during a ribbon cutting ceremony Thursday, officially making the 133-year-old institution accessible to all.  Due to a steep set of stairs and the lack of an elevator, the facility was previously deemed inaccessible to those who are handicapped, disabled, temporarily injured and/or require a wheelchair or stroller for transport, officials said. That means roughly 12 percent of Suffolk County residents were unable to utilize the historical society for its rich history museum and research library.  “It’s been an issue since the very beginning,” said SCHS Executive Director Victoria Berger. “The [previous] entrance – it [had] really impeded accessibility.”  Frank Krotschinksy, director of the Suffolk County Office for People with Disabilities has, for over 40 years, been directly affected by the historical society’s limited architectural design. Ms. Berger said Mr. Krotschinsky has been a huge source of support and inspiration throughout the project.  “As a person who uses a wheelchair, I’ve been driving by this facility, this building for many, many years,” Mr. Krotschinsky said. “Ever since I moved out to Suffolk County in the mid-70s. And I always wondered how I get in here. I always wanted to come inside. A couple of years ago they called my office wanting to know if I knew of funds so that they could put an accessible entrance in here. I did a little bit of research for them, but really, they did the work in having funding approved and getting the entrance built and I’m thrilled.”  The building now follows a universal architectural design, which includes a ground-level entrance, the addition of on-site parking, accommodating restroom facilities and an elevator. Local architects Gary Jacquemin and Robert Stromski led the design, while Radon Construction dealt with the brick and mortar.  It was about eight years ago that serious planning and fundraising began for the $1 million capital project, when the Robert David Lion Gardiner Foundation – one of the project’s major donors – first provided seed money. Kathryn Curran, executive director of the Gardiner Foundation, was executive director of the historical society at the time.  “She was the first to sign contracts on this project and then was able to help us see it through with tremendous grant support,” Ms. Berger said of Ms. Curran to an audience of donors and supporters at Thursday’s ceremony.  Though the groundbreaking took place in May and the estimated completion date was that summer, the team hit a significant setback along the way.  “The water table was much, much higher than calculated and so, immediately after groundbreaking, we had the site flooding,” Ms. Berger said. “We had to arrange for dewatering, which delayed the project quite a bit.”  The historical society remained open through both the project’s design and construction phases – something Ms. Berger said is a product of her staff’s commitment.  SCHS Board President Bob Barauskas said the society’s focus on keeping the museum and library up to par, in terms of both safety and environmentalism, dates back nearly a decade, when in 2011 the building’s front staircase was redone and a heating pad was placed just below the surface to melt ice during winter months. In 2013, one of the interior rooms was refurbished and in 2017, climate-control devices were installed in the library and attic. Last year, the building converted its antiquated boiler system to gas.  Additional major donors on the accessibility project include New York State Council on the Arts and Empire State Development. Funding and support was also provided by the Kenneth J. Tedaldi Foundation, the Leo S. Walsh Foundation, the John C. Dunphy Private Foundation and a host of smaller private donors, as well as Suffolk County National Bank.  Frank Grasso, a board member at the John C. Dunphy Private Foundation said he decided to help when he first heard about the planned capital improvements years ago.  “We just like the idea of adding value to a community center, and that’s where it started,” he said. “We learned as we went along, as we’re still learning, what this is all about. The character of the place, the museum … I think it made good sense to support the local community … You can do things that help people individually, or you can do things that help people collectively, so we saw this as an opportunity to help people collectively.”  Also in attendance Thursday were county and local representatives, including Legislator Tom Cilmi (R-Islip), Riverhead Town Supervisor Laura Jens-Smith, Councilwoman Jodi Giglio, Councilwoman Catherine Kent and Councilman Tim Hubbard.  “This has been the baby that’s been so many years in development,” Ms. Berger said. “It’s just exciting and exhilarating to be able to open the doors.”  Top Caption: Officials celebrate the opening of the accessibility wing at the Suffolk County Historical Society.

# It's Not Just Humans: Sun Bears Also Communicate by Mimicking Facial Expressions - D-brief

A fully-grown female sun bear. (Credit: Daniela Hartmann) “A smile is infectious,” so goes the cheesy saying. But there’s actually some validity there. It’s long been known that people, often unintentionally, mimic the facial expressions of those around them. This communication technique was thought to only exist in humans and gorillas, but new research is challenging that idea. A recent study in sun bears, which are the smallest (and possibly cutest) species of bear in the world, shows that they, too, mimic the expressions of their peers. During bouts of play, researchers observed how sun bears copied the exact facial expressions of their playmates, almost instantaneously. They think that sun bears use facial mimicry to signal play and strengthens their social bonds. Their research, published today in the journal Scientific Reports, suggests that animal communication could be more complex and advanced than we thought. From talking to laughing to rolling our eyes, there are countless ways that humans interact with one another. But one way of communicating that we don’t often think about is by mimicking each other’s facial expressions. Research shows that this subtle, often subconscious form of communication can help us convey emotions and strengthen bonds with our peers. But until recently, only humans and gorillas, who are both social creatures, have been shown to possess this trait. To see if facial mimicry exists in more solitary animals, a team of researchers from the University of Portsmouth in England set out to study sun bears, who generally keep to themselves outside of mating season. They headed out to the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre in Malaysia and observed 22 of these tiny bears, which top out at just five feet tall when standing on two legs and weigh no more than 175 pounds. (Credit: Daniela Hartmann) Despite being anti-social, sun bears do engage in adorable play from time to time. During the two years that the researchers observed them, they witnessed 372 bouts of play, most of which were gentle rather than rough. While they played, the team noted two distinct facial expressions made by the bears: one where they opened their mouths and showed their upper incisor teeth, and another where they opened their mouths but didn’t show their upper incisors. To test facial mimicry, the researchers noted each time a bear made one of these expressions and recorded how their playmate responded. They found that about 20 percent of the time, bears returned an expression within one second of their playmate making one. If the bear’s expression showed its upper incisors, its playmate returned the same upper incisor expression 82 percent of the time. And if the bear didn’t show its upper incisors, their playmate returned an incisor-less expression 72 percent of the time. They also discovered that sun bears were more likely to mimic facial expressions during gentle play rather than rough. The researchers think that facial mimicry signals gentle play, while a lack of mimicry shows that they’re ready for rougher play. This social interaction, previously unseen in bears, could shake up our idea of how animals communicate. “It is widely believed that we only find complex forms of communication in species with complex social systems. As sun bears are a largely solitary species, our study of their facial communication questions this belief, because it shows a complex form of facial communication that until now was known only in more social species,” Derry Taylor, an animal communications researcher at the University of Portsmouth and co-author of the paper, said in a news release. Based on their findings, the researchers think that facial mimicry could span across many species, far beyond humans and gorillas. More research is needed to confirm this theory, but if it holds up, we might have to bear the thought of animals having complex modes of communication.

# Cheetay.pk launches operations in Islamabad

LAHORE (PR) Cheetay.pk is launching its operations in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, with a bucket of over 300 restaurants. A last mile logistics company, having been based in Lahore since its inception, believes that it is the right time to expand geographically into other cities of Pakistan, with Islamabad being the first on the list. The expansion to Islamabad, with the aim to provide users with a greater customer experience than the alternatives, supports the long term growth plans of cheetay.pk to become the leader of the industry.  After spearheading e-commerce firms like Daraz.pk and Kaymu.pk, Ahmed Khan, the CEO of Cheetay.pk, launched the company in 2015, in the cultural capital of Pakistan, Lahore. Initially, starting off as a food delivery service that caused a storm in the industry, the business expanded vertically into providing logistics for other goods, namely books, cosmetics and healthcare.  “When planning to launch cheetay.pk in Lahore, as a company that understands the needs of the local community better than anyone else in the industry, the goal was always to be a national player in the market rather than just limiting ourselves to one specific region. After having perfected our base of operations, and having molded our services into a unique value proposition that our customers are looking for, we feel the time is right to move into the capital. As a market, Islamabad offers a great opportunity for us to grow and make our brand into a community that the people of Pakistan can associate themselves with for years to come,” says Khan.  Cheetay.pk has captured a significant portion of Lahore’s market by creating a brand which is synonymous with quality and timely delivery. The plan for the company, now, is to expand into other metropolitan cities, with Islamabad as first on the map, and then strategically spreading into smaller cities.<end_of_turn>

# New Mexico governor signs landmark clean energy bill

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Making good on a campaign promise, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Friday signed landmark legislation that will mandate more solar panels and wind turbines as the state sets ambitious new renewable energy goals.  The Democratic governor, environmentalists and others gathered at the state capitol for a signing ceremony.  The measure requires that investor-owned utilities and rural electric cooperatives get at least half of their electricity from renewable sources by 2030. That would jump to 80 percent by 2040.  A 100 percent carbon-free mandate would kick in five years later for utilities. Electric co-ops would have until 2050 to meet that goal.  Lujan Grisham, who took office in January, said the legislation resulted from a year of negotiations that brought together utilities, unions and environmental advocates.  "The Energy Transition Act fundamentally changes the dynamic in New Mexico," she said in a statement. "This legislation is a promise to future generations of New Mexicans, who will benefit from both a cleaner environment and a more robust energy economy."  Aside from the renewable energy quotas, funds will be established to help ease the economic pains of closing the coal-fired San Juan Generating Station near Farmington.  Critics described the legislation as a boon for Public Service Co. of New Mexico, which operates the power plant. Language in the law will allow Public Service Co. of New Mexico and other owners of the San Juan to recover investments in the plant by selling bonds that are later paid off by utility customers.  The utility plans to shutter the plant in 2022 as part of its plans to divest coal-fired generation.  Regulatory and market pressures have pushed many utilities across the U.S. to move away from fossil fuels. PNM is no exception, and utility executives have said that despite the new law, they already were on a path that would boost the percentage of renewable and carbon-free energy sources within their portfolio.  "PNM is fully aware of the challenges this legislation places squarely on our company, but we know there is no better place than New Mexico to grow the renewable energy economy," said Pat Vincent-Collawn, PNM Resources' president and chief executive.  She said the company will be taking the challenge head on and will work to balance "this new path forward" with the needs of its workers and customers.  The company touted its current portfolio, saying existing wind, solar and geothermal resources annually generate enough electricity to power more than 154,000 average homes.  The company also said customers will realize savings in their bills through the refinancing of bonds related to the San Juan plant and the production of more electricity from renewable sources.  State energy secretary Sarah Cottrell Propst described the new law — with its new quotes, financing mechanism for retiring coal plants and community assistance programs — as the strongest package of its kind in the U.S.  Governors in Wisconsin and Colorado have campaigned on renewable energy, while legislation calling for higher renewable energy quotas was introduced in Illinois and Minnesota. In Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee has pushed legislation aimed at eliminating fossil fuels like natural gas and coal from his state's electricity supply by 2045.<end_of_turn>

Kuhn, who turned 19 on Wednesday, was approaching a short ball from German Mischa Zverev when he suddenly cramped up and dropped to the hard court surface. For several moments the Austrian-born Spaniard lay motionless before he began visibly writhing in pain with what was later determined to be a severe cramp. His trainer ran to him and gave him some water, which appeared to make Kuhn feel better physically, but the world's 255th-ranked player was clearly upset about retiring from a match he nearly won. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO Rising tennis star Nicola Kuhn collapsed mid-point during a first-round match at the Miami Open this week, crumbling to the court and frightening fans as he appeared to land face first Kuhn, who turned 19 on Wednesday, was approaching a short ball from German Mischa Zverev when he suddenly cramped up and dropped to the hard court surface His trainer ran to him and gave him some water, which appeared to make Kuhn feel better physically, but the world's 255th-ranked player was clearly upset about retiring from the match Kuhn had a 6-2, 5-2 lead at one point, but failed to convert eight match points as Zverev pushed the match into the third set. Humidity and the 80-degree temperatures may have contributed to the cramps. Kuhn was ultimately helped off the court and later made a statement on Twitter: 'Left it all on court.

# Strong start for Norwegian seafood exports in 2019 - Norway Today

Norway exported 198,700 tonnes of seafood with a value of NOK 7.8 billion in February. This is a reduction of 57,000 tonnes or 22 per cent in volume but an increase in the value of NOK 670 million or 9 per cent compared with February last year. So far this year, 406,000 tonnes of seafood have been exported with a value of NOK 16.4 billion. This is a 13 per cent decrease in volume while export value has increased by NOK 1.6 billion or 11 per cent compared with the same period last year. “February 2019 has been the best ever February for Norwegian seafood exports. This is due, among other factors, to the increased value of salmon exports once again. In addition, increased volumes and increased shipping prices have contributed to a value increase in the whitefish category. There has also been an increase in the value herring and mackerel exports in February, contributing to the strong results. Volume declines for this month is attributed to the lack of catch of capelin”, says seafood analyst Ingrid Kristine Pettersen. Source: seafood.no / Norway Today<end_of_turn>

# I-77 toll lane signs will flash messages in the Lake Norman area, but don’t be fooled

Digital signs for the Interstate 77 toll lanes project are scheduled to flash messages beginning Monday in the Lake Norman area, but don’t let that fool you into thinking you can ride in the lanes just yet.  Signs will be tested on I-77 from I-485 near Huntersville to Mooresville in southern Iredell County.  Sign Up and Save  Get six months of free digital access to The Charlotte Observer  #ReadLocal  “Motorists will see the digital message signs on the right-hand side of the road with rotating messages that read “EXPRESS LANES ARE CLOSED” and “TEST,” according to an I-77 Mobility Partners news release on Friday.  Signs above the toll lanes, which remain under construction, also will be tested, officials said.  “The toll signs will display numbers to conduct this testing,” according to the release. “Drivers may also see test-related vehicles in (the toll lanes) as this testing is occurring.”  Planned entrances to the toll lanes from I-77’s existing free lanes will remain “closed and blocked,” project officials said in the release.  The 26-mile project from Mooresville to uptown Charlotte was supposed to finish in late 2018, but work will continue until later this year, state highway officials said.  The northern part of the project, from Hambright Road in Huntersville to Exit 36 in Mooresville, is scheduled to open soon, according to Friday’s I-77 Mobility Partners release, although no month or day has been released.  When the northern section opens, “customers will receive a 25 percent promotional rate off tolls until the entire roadway opens,” officials said.<end_of_turn>

# Northern Lights may be visible from Chicago this weekend

There is a possibility of seeing the Northern Lights from the Windy City on Saturday, though that chance is small. Forecasting the extent of the Aurora Borelius is a difficult as there isn't really a great way to predict the extent of the energy coming from the sun and how it will interact with the Earth's atmosphere. The latest forecast calls for the potential for the Northern Lights to be seen as far south as Northern Illinois. But there are some limiting factors for us here in Chicago. The time when the Northern Lights would be visible for Chicago would be before sunrise Saturday and also Saturday night. Clouds will be increasing Saturday night, so that timeframe does not look promising. Skies will be clear Saturday between 2-6 a.m., which presents a small possibility of seeing the Northern Lights. Here are some hints if you are out hunting for the Aurora:<end_of_turn>

# Adwaita movie review: This Large Short Films release remains soulless, directionless and pointless- Entertainment News, Firstpost

Adwaita movie review: This Large Short Films release remains soulless, directionless and pointless  Adwaita, which released recently on YouTube, was among the Perfect 10 winners presented by Large Short Films at MAMI 2018. It sets out to explore domestic violence by using the tried and tested trope of good and evil residing within the same person. Almost exclusively shot inside a dingy little dark room, it features a cast of three or four actors who speak Haryanvi fluently and convincingly. That’s about all the good that can be written about this 19-odd minute short film.  A father and son have a heated conversation in front of a girl whom the father kidnapped earlier that day. In a series of flashbacks, director Manwar Rana reveals the father’s proclivity for physical violence directed towards his late wife and their son. The visibly meek son learns a secret or two during the conversation and predictably proceeds to finally stand up to the tyrant. Mother’s gentle voice-over reminding him about a person’s capacity for being Ram or Raavan floats cumbrously over the poorly stylised images.  Adwaita never manages to become anything more than another assembly line product aiming to capitalise on trending topics. It has nothing new to add to a cultural conversation whose significance deserves a more considered artistic response. Its depiction of women’s struggles and the violence they undergo in rural areas is executed with scant regard for the urgency of the issue it seeks to address. The acting, with the possible exception of the father, and that too in patches, is pathetic. One can overlook the production design in a modestly budgeted film but not the lazy cinematography and aimless direction that brings the house down. The creators had a wonderful opportunity to employ light and shadow in this dark room lit by a dim source to explore the psyches of the verbally sparring protagonists as they hurtle towards a violent end. But in the absence of a vision and an interesting story, Adwaita remains soulless, directionless and pointless.  There is no dearth of films that seek to engage with urgent or important ideas in an arbitrary, poor manner. Some of them are even earnest at heart. But the simplistic engagement with pressing issues only serves to diminish the significance of the movements that seek to sustain their relevance in the public discourse. These movements’ communal aspect is weighed down by opportunism, thereby offering the strongest argument against these films. In effect, these films are their own worst endorsers and strongest critics.  Adwaita’s use of the binaries of good and evil within the context of domestic violence, however well-meaning it may be, is utterly ignorant about the simplistic nature of binaries. Then there are the silent, suffering women marginalised even within the film that seeks to expose the violence that befalls them. Finally, there’s the passing on of the torch of adopting a moral choice between the binaries, which, in this film, lies squarely and exclusively with men. One can argue for the realistic nature of the film’s narrative. But one cannot ignore the lack of self-awareness and cumbersome filmmaking that belies the film’s central concern.  Long story short, Adwaita is a short video that seeks to belong to its time but ends up doing the exact opposite. Devoid of ideas and inspiration, it stumbles towards a pathetic, violent end not unlike its drunken protagonist.  Rating: ★  Watch Adwaita here:  Updated Date: Mar 24, 2019 10:39:23 IST<end_of_turn>

# 'Kondo-ing' is the latest dating trend you need to know about

When it comes to dating, as if things weren't already complicated enough, there's now a whole dictionary of relationship lingo you need to know.  Now we're being bombarded with a range of brand new dating terms, which are sweeping the nation thanks to the experts over at Plenty of Fish.  These include the likes of 'Kondo-ing' which is taken from Netflix 's Queen of Clean Maire Kondo, as well as 'Brexit-ing', which needs no guesses as to its origins.  Shannon Smith, resident dating and relationship expert at Plenty of Fish, said: "Brits are no longer just sweeping their love lives under the carpet. This Spring, singles are taking action to spruce up their dates and relationships.  "Following the trends we have seen in the dating world at this time of year, we've pulled together a list of terms to help prepare you for dating this month."  There are six trends on their list, with the first being 'Kondo-ing'.  Kondo-ing  Plenty of Fish took inspiration from Marie Kondo, 34, a Japanese organising consultant and author.  They describe 'Kondo-ing' as the practice of re-organsiing your love life to set free the people who doesn't "spark joy" for you.  You then go out and instead find a new special someone, who does make you feel that way.  Hinch-ing  There's not just one cleaning queen that's made the dating trend cut, Essex-based Mrs Hinch has also inspired a trend.  'Hinch-ing' is where a person "seeks inspiration from Mrs Hinch" to turn their messy partner into a cleaning guru.  Brexit-ing  As well as cleaning-inspired trends, there's also 'Brexit-ing', inspired by the current chaos that is British Politics.  This one is said to occur when a partner threatens to leave the relationship, then you manage to renegotiate the terms and stay together at the last minute.  Easter Ex-Hunting, Daffa-dilling and Blossoming  The final three trends are all inspired by Spring and Easter - Easter Ex-Hunting, Daffa-dilling and Blossoming.  The first is pretty self-explanatory and involves messaging an ex partner so that you have someone to spend the Easter/Bank Holiday with.  Meanwhile daffa-dilling is said to be when an old flame pops into your life at the same time every year for a short period of time.  And then there's blossoming, which might be the nicest one of the bunch and it sees a couple staying together at the end of 'cuffing season' and blossoming into the next stage of a relationship.<end_of_turn>

# 150 miners participate in lottery

The government says it has kept its promise. It held its first mining lottery in the first quarter of 2019 for small scale miners. 
After listening to concerns of residents regarding mining and land allocation during a visit to Mahdia in Region Eight last month, Minister of Natural Resources, Raphael Trotman, revealed that he had taken steps to hold a lottery to benefit the local community. 
The minister had stated that he had written to Guyana Geology and Mines Commission (GGMC) Commissioner, Newell Dennison, about hosting a lottery. 
On Friday, Minister Trotman said he was elated that Government had kept its promise. He said for a very long time he felt the frustration of Guyanese who could not access these prospective properties. “Today is a good day for miners.” 
“Today is a feeling of elation, of satisfaction that something that we wanted to do for some time is actually getting done and I’m happy that it is being done without any controversy or confusion.” 
The exercise got underway just about 10:00hrs at the Girls Guide Pavilion in Brickdam. 
Over 150 miners registered and paid a non-refundable participating fee of $5,000 to become eligible for the lottery. 
They would have also had to provide their National Identification card, Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) certificate and proof of address. 
Minister Trotman said that in the group, there were persons who never mined before, but like everyone else, they too had a right to the country’s natural resources. 
He said the staff at GGMC had been busy in the background. 
“They have been going through coordinates… we have to ensure that the lands are not somebody else’s land and that they have a good prospect for gold recovery.” 
In the meantime, many miners related their gratitude and satisfaction. 
Alicia Veloza said the miners waited a long time to acquire land in the extraction sector. 
“For years we had problems acquiring land, and so we had to work on other people’s land. This is an opportunity to have our own.” 
Minister Trotman said there will be other mining lotteries in various parts of the country; including Bartica, Mahdia, Port Kaituma and Matthews Ridge.

# King's Men 1st gospel concert tour for Live Nation

ATLANTA (AP) -- Kirk Franklin, Marvin Sapp, Donnie McClurkin and Israel Houghton believe if they collectively raise their voices high enough, believers will come in droves. And Live Nation is banking on it.  The four gospel superstars feel confident entering the upcoming King's Men tour, the first gospel concert tour backed by Live Nation Inc., the world's largest concert promoter. The concert series will be the first step toward proving the genre can broaden its fan base and become a lucrative business for the promotional company.  "The hope is that the tour does so well that the demand continues to grow," Houghton said in a recent interview. "I think if we play it right, and executed it the way we hope, it's going to be a game changer."  The 16-city tour kids off Sept. 16 in Phoenix. Franklin views it as an opportunity to pave the way for other top gospel acts. As a follow-up to King's Men, he hopes there will be an all-women gospel tour that'll include acts such as Mary Mary and Yolanda Adams.  "This tour is an extension of all (our) sacrifice and hard work," he said. "It's an extension of the Fred Hammonds, the Commissioned. ... It's important that everybody sees us as an extension of them. The success of this will continue to open up those doors to celebrate those men, ladies and daughters of the King's Men tour."  Franklin assembled the team of gospel's heavyweight singers to join him, and then approached Live Nation with the idea of the King's Men tour. He invited one of the company's executives to attend the recent Stellar Awards with him.  That's all Franklin needed to hook Live Nation, and everything else fell into place.  "I saw how amazing the emotional side of gospel is," said Kevin Morrow, the senior vice president of touring at Live Nation and a former manager for gospel group The Blind Boys of Alabama. "I had forgotten how unbelievably great the singers are in gospel. I went back and told everyone else at Live Nation that we need to get in business with them."  Morrow said he was impressed by the different elements of musical talent the self-proclaimed "King's Men" bring to the table. He was attracted by McClurkin's smooth crooning, Franklin's ability to mesh a hip-hop melody with gospel as a producer and choir director, Sapp's soaring voice and Houghton's jazzy rock presence.  "When you see those four guys together, the only thing you can compare them to in the rock world are the Traveling Wilburys," Morrow said of the supergroup that included Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty. "With the King's Men, these are four guys, four different parts of their lives with four different types of music. This just seems like the right time and the right movement for them and gospel."  Morrow said the tour could lead to additional cities for the King's Men. He said Live Nation also is looking into promoting gospel tours through House of Blues venues for up-and-coming artists in the genre. But it's predicated on how well the King's Men tour packs venues in each city. Live Nation isn't concerned how the tour will do in larger cities like Los Angeles and Houston, but will certainly keep a close eye on smaller markets like Tampa, Fla.; Hartford, Conn.; and Norfolk, Va. The cities for the tour were chosen based on the foursome's strongest markets and their hometowns.  Sapp knows there are no guarantees. However, he feels optimistic that people from the gospel community will come out and support the tour.  "They are extremely loyal to the genre," Sapp said. "This is our chance. This is our time to promote the King's music to another level."  ———  Online:  http://www.livenation.com  ———  Follow Jonathan Landrum Jr. on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/mrlandrum31<end_of_turn>

# Opinion: The state should listen to the people

Terrebonne Parish chooses to work with the energy industry to help grow the local economy, create good jobs and work to protect our coast. However, the State seemingly does not want us to set our own path with our most important industry. The Louisiana Department of Natural Resources directing the Terrebonne Parish DA to potentially lay the groundwork for lawsuits looks like the opposite of what the State of Louisiana and Gov. John Bel Edwards said they would do. In 2016, Gov. Edwards encouraged Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes to sue energy companies or the State “will do so.” Parish Presidents Dove and Cantrelle stated that they preferred not to sue and would work together with the industry, as both parishes have for decades. The Terrebonne Parish Council passed a resolution not to sue energy companies. In late 2016, according to state lawyer Donald Price, the governor chose not to file lawsuits because some parishes “proposed an alternative to filing suit.” Those parishes “would begin investigating their claims and gather information ... in lieu of filing lawsuits.” This is exactly what Parish President Dove is doing in Terrebonne by already auditing thousands of coastal use permits. It raises the question: Why is the state going against its own words and telling Terrebonne Parish to do something the community clearly said it does not want to do – sue the largest employer here and likely hurt any positive recovery of the industry. Hostile threats and over-the-top lawsuits don’t build relationships. They end them. There is another way, and it is not found in a courtroom. The best way to preserve Louisiana’s economic and coastal future is working with the oil and natural gas industry, not against it. Louisiana’s energy industry remains the primary economic driver of state and local finances - including money dedicated to coastal restoration. Even through the recent downturn, in the Bayou Region, several thousand citizens work for energy companies and service businesses with more opportunities emerging here each day. One of every 13 jobs in Terrebonne and Lafourche is directly attributable to the operations of Port Fourchon. There are twice as many energy workers in Terrebonne than the number of Louisiana employees working at the largest Fortune 500 company based in the state. The work of the people and businesses of Terrebonne’s energy industry creates more than $8 million each year for services we all need, like law enforcement, roads, playgrounds and schools. Louisiana’s energy industry is the largest entity, beyond the federal government, contributing to Louisiana’s coast. It serves as the primary funding source for projects that are in the works right now to protect our state’s precious coastline and the environment where we all live. Beyond jobs and money, energy companies, like ConocoPhillips, have built real coastal projects for decades not because they have to, but because they want to. For example, 2,500 acres have been restored by Terrebonne Parish, Ducks Unlimited, the energy industry and the state working together through the Liner Canal, Carencro Bayou and Lost Lake projects. Apache Corporation received Louisiana’s top conservation award for planting 4 million trees along the coast. Port Fourchon has paid for the construction of 1,000 acres of wetlands with thousands more acres planned as they consider expansion. Terrebonne Parish is pursuing its plan to work with the industry. This plan is creating jobs and building a working coast. The state just needs to listen.  Marc Ehrhardt is executive director of the Grow Louisiana Coalition.<end_of_turn>

# Kristy Swanson posts ‘goofy’ Luke Perry throwback photo from ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’: ‘I love you'

“For #FlashbackFriday I wanted to share this photo of Luke and I goofing off on the set of Buffy,” she wrote alongside the image, which shows her wearing fake lips and fangs, while Perry wore a similar prop. “Always a committed actor, he makes the perfect face for the character in the moment. I miss you so much my Buddy. I love you,” she concluded. Perry died on March 4, just days after he suffered a "massive stroke" at his California home. The former “Beverly Hills, 90210” star was 52 at the time of his death. "He was surrounded by his children Jack and Sophie, fiancé Wendy Madison Bauer, ex-wife Minnie Sharp, mother Ann Bennett, step-father Steve Bennett, brother Tom Perry, sister Amy Coder, and other close family and friends," Perry's publicist Arnold Robinson told Fox News at the time. "The family appreciates the outpouring of support and prayers that have been extended to Luke from around the world, and respectfully request privacy in this time of great mourning." Following his death, Perry’s fellow "Beverly Hills, 90210" castmates Jason Priestley and Tiffani Thiessen paid tribute to the actor, as did many cast members from the hit teen drama “Riverdale,” on which Perry recently played Archie Andrews’ father Fred. The actor was largely remembered by celebrities as a TV icon and a "kind person." Fox News' Sasha Savitsky contributed to this report.<end_of_turn>

# Showboating boxer cops brutal knockout in dying seconds of fight

Mayweather, Ali, Tyson: The greatest boxers of all-time2:03 Take a closer look at what makes Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather so special. Sam Maxwell scored a dramatic knockout in the final 15 seconds worthy of any Hollywood film. The 30-year-old super-lightweight was down on the scorecards, having been dropped twice, as his French opponent, Sabri Sediri, looked to have boxed to an away upset. With the clock running down Sediri goaded Maxwell, showboating with his hands down leaving an exposed chin.  Woooooow! 😳 — Boxing on BT Sport 🥊 (@BTSportBoxing) March 23, 2019 Sam Maxwell was losing and being taunted by his opponent all fight and then did this with 10 second to go! Incredible knockout 👊 pic.twitter.com/qM069RZnQK However, out of nowhere, Maxwell managed to do what had escaped him the entire fight: Land a telling shot to trouble Sediri. With just 15 seconds left, Maxwell pulled out a devastating right hand, flattening the Frenchman and completely turning the fight around with seconds remaining. As Sediri fell crashing down, his Hackney born opponent could not help but let out a roar as he nailed the cocksure underdog. The Frenchman made it to his feet, but upon stumbling back into the ropes the referee waved off the contest and Maxwell saved his unbeaten record with seconds remaining.  the way he's just bouncing around the ring as if he owns the place and then just gets knocked out😭😂 — LiamLJ9 (@Lj9Liam) March 23, 2019 Originally published as Cocky boxer cops brutal KO<end_of_turn>

# Millennial investor: how I chose the first fund I've invested in

The financial diary of a twentysomething's quest to invest her way on to the property ladder  Nothing is given so freely as advice – but following bad tips can really cost.  I’ve been sent words of wisdom from countless readers of the Millennial investor series. They’ve ranged from the truly helpful (“watch out for hidden fees and always reinvest your dividends”) to the somewhat hurtful (“your first financial mistake was to become a journalist – you’ll never get rich quick with that kind of thinking”).  Some have been self-contradictory. One email read, “Don’t take advice from anyone. Not even from me. And never invest in something that you hear about in the pub.”  I have no shame about relying...

# Four wine shops in Gloucestershire are at risk of closure

Who doesn't love a glass of wine after a long day? Well you may have to go elsewhere to get your favourite tipple now.  Shoppers have suffered yet another blow as the UK's largest specialist retailer of wine has revealed that it will be closing some of its stores.  Majestic Wine has made the announcement that it will undergo a "group transformation plan" which will involve shutting some of its retailers.  The company, which has around 200 stores in the UK, bought Naked Wines in 2015 and plans to "accelerate new customer investment" into the new brand.  But in order to fund discounts and recruitment for the new brand, the company is selling off Majestic Wine stores.  Chief executive Rowan Gormley said: "We have taken a decision to focus all of our capital and energies into delivering the long-term potential of Naked and releasing value from Majestic.  "Our plans for doing this are well advanced, and we look forward to sharing the final details in June."  He added: "Where we have no choice but to close stores we will aim to minimise job losses by migration into Naked."  It is yet unclear how many stores and which stores will face closure.  However, there are four stores in Gloucestershire - including venues in Gloucester, Cheltenham, Stroud and Cirencester - which may all face the chop.<end_of_turn>

# China's MMG to declare force majeure on copper from Peru mine as...

China's MMG to declare force majeure on copper from Peru mine as blockade continues  LIMA/HONG KONG, March 26 (Reuters) - Chinese miner MMG Ltd on Tuesday said it expected to declare force majeure on contracts for copper from its Las Bambas deposit in Peru, hit by a weeks-long blockade by an indigenous community.  MMG, controlled by state-owned China Minmetals Corp Ltd, said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange that it expected production at the site to be "progressively impacted" from later this week.  "Consequently, force majeure will be declared under sales contracts," it said, without giving further detail on the contracts that would be affected.  Las Bambas is one of Peru's biggest copper mines, with about 385,000 tonnes in output last year.  The move comes after the indigenous community's second-in-command said on Monday that it would not take part in negotiations aimed at ending its blockade of a road used by MMG until its leader is freed from jail.  Edison Vargas, the vice president of Fuerabamba, said by phone that the arrests last week of the community's president and lawyers on accusations of extortion were groundless and aimed to delegitimize their complaints.  Fuerabamba wants MMG to pay it for using a stretch of road on its farmland, accusing the company of building it to transport copper from its Las Bambas mine without the community's permission.  The company denies those allegations and has said it remains open to dialogue.  "Our primary focus remains on ensuring the health, safety and security of our employees, contractors and the community," MMG CEO Gao Xiaoyu said in Tuesday's filing to the Hong Kong bourse.  "The company will continue to pursue active dialogue with Fuerabamba and other community representatives, as well as the authorities, to seek a safe and peaceful resolution to current concerns," Gao added.  The arrests have triggered an outcry from other communities in Peru's southern copper belt, threatening to broaden a protest that has prevented Las Bambas' copper output from being shipped to market for more than a month.  The mayors of six districts in the province where Las Bambas is located, Cotabambas, have signed a declaration condemning the "criminalization" of local leaders and calling on MMG and the government to make good on previous commitments to communities in the region.  The government of President Martin Vizcarra did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It previously denied it was behind the arrests of Gregorio Rojas, Fuerabamba's president, or Fuerabamba's lawyers, the brothers Jorge and Frank Chavez.  Peru's police department did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. The police have accused Rojas and the Chavez brothers of belonging to a criminal organization that deals in extortion, but have not yet publicly detailed the evidence against them.  MMG said protests near the entrance to the Las Bambas mine were disrupting personnel transport, as well as inbound and outbound logistics.  Peru, the world's No. 2 copper producer, is rife with conflicts over mining, especially in remote provinces where international companies operate alongside farming communities.

# LETTER TO THE EDITOR: The Marsh Common Core bill, how it affects you

This past week state Sen. Del Marsh made headlines when he introduced a bill that effectively removes Alabama schools from Common Core by 2021. Do you support or oppose this bill and what does Common Core mean to the average citizens? The Common Core State Standards Initiative (Common Core) was a byproduct of President George Bush's, "No Child Left Behind" program in the late 1990s. A broad consortium of educators, governors and business executives convened to, allegedly, address the concerns of the business world and post secondary educational institutions that America’s school were falling behind in teaching techniques and quality of education for today’s business and academic environment. In 2004, this group adopted the Common Core State Standards Initiative, drastically changing not only the curriculum of mathematics and language arts, but the method of testing and evaluating students as well. This agenda has not sat well with all states, although to date, 45 states have signed on to the program. Opposition appears to be more focused toward methodology and implementation than actual changes to improve the quality of education. Much of the criticism has been centered on this being seen as an attempt to establish a national curriculum disseminated from Washington. Supporters of Common Core say no, yet, the very philosophy of the project does not support their denials.  While some attempt has been made to tie mandatory compliance with Common Core to local federal funding for education, such action has been strictly prohibited with the signing of The Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. Marsh's bill would totally remove Alabama's schools from Common Core by 2021. The state, to date, has only partially implemented Core standards. Alabama State Superintendent of Education Eric Mackey said Marsh's bill would create a nightmare within state education mandating that systems be returned to the methods and procedures of the 1990s, triggering enormous cost. So, is Marsh's Common Core bill viable? Is it a necessary thing or possibly political posturing by a politician hoping to unseat Democrat U.S. Sen. Doug Jones? Are we as voters prepared to surrender further local control of our schools to Washington by opposing Marsh's bill and embracing Common Core?  James W. Anderson Talladega<end_of_turn>

# EDITORIAL: Mueller report marks a good day for America — now let us read it

EDITORIAL: Mueller report marks a good day for America — now let us read it  Subscribe for unlimited digital access. Try one month for $1! Subscribe for unlimited digital access. Try one month for $1!  The American people have a right to decide for themselves.  Let’s see the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Let’s read it and decide for ourselves how convincingly it clears Donald Trump and his presidential campaign of collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice.   EDITORIAL The Mueller report, if we are to believe a four-page summary released on Sunday by Attorney General William Barr, should put to rest serious talk of impeachment. As Republicans learned two decades ago when they impeached President Bill Clinton for lying about sex, that’s a fool’s game unless the American people are behind you — and the Mueller report’s findings are not about to turn more Americans against President Donald Trump.  If Trump is a terrible president — and he is — the better course is to vote him out of office next year.  But in the interest of pulling a polarized country closer together, if only slightly, the Department of Justice would do well to release as much of the Mueller report as possible, within the rules of grand jury secrecy.  If in fact Mueller found no evidence that the Trump campaign worked hand-in-hand with the Russians, as Barr states in his summary, let’s hear that in the report’s own words. If there is insufficient evidence that Trump attempted to obstruct justice — Barr’s conclusion, based on his reading of the report — let’s also read that for ourselves.  With due to respect to Barr, he simply can’t be trusted on this second point. He may have made up his mind a long time ago. He was appointed attorney general by Trump in February after submitting a 20-page legal memo on why the president had not obstructed justice.  We’d like to read the full Mueller report, or as much as prudently possible, because we’re inclined to think we’d accept its findings, and we’d like to move on.  We suspect millions of other Americans, Trump critics included, would like to do the same.  Whatever else one might say about the Mueller report, it is the product of an honorable man and team who shut out politics and put the law first. The completion of the report marks a good day for America. Consider what it took to get us here:  An attorney general, Jeff Sessions, refused to shut down a Justice Department investigation despite constant pressure and ridicule from his boss, the president. A deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, appointed the superbly qualified Mueller to head the investigation, despite further furious attacks from Trump. And Mueller and his team quietly dug for two years, issuing 2,800 subpoenas and interviewing some 500 witnesses, despite Trump’s almost daily cries of “witch hunt.”  This was no witch hunt. It was the American system, prevailing.  “I’m just very proud that this happened,” Chicago attorney Dan Webb, who was a special counsel in the Iran-Contra Affair in the 1980s, told us. “It’s a good result for the country. … Government worked as it’s supposed to.”  Trump has called the Mueller report a “complete and total exoneration,” which it is not. Especially as to the matter of obstruction of justice — whether the president tried to kill the investigation — that remains an open question. Barr sees no obstruction of justice, at least nothing that rises to the level of a crime, but members of Congress may see it otherwise, once allowed to read the report for themselves.  The fact that Mueller found no proof of an underlying crime — no collusion with Russia — does not matter.  Now, however, the investigative spotlight should turn more to Trump’s business dealings, past and present.  While the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York is busily investigating possible past financial crimes by Trump and his various businesses, Democrats in the House would be wise to step up their investigation into any current financial and personal conflicts of interest.  The FBI launched the original investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election because, in part, Trump was behaving like Vladimir Putin’s lapdog, taking the Russian president’s side against our nation’s best interests and seeing no evil.  People wondered what Putin had on Trump — and they wonder still. Nothing there has changed.  If Trump is in any way beholden to Russia, Saudi Arabia or another foreign power — as his secret efforts to seal a deal for a Trump hotel in Moscow during the 2016 campaign would suggest — we had better find out.

# Wirecard shares soar after law firm clears head office of wrongdoing

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Local staff at the Singapore office of Wirecard may have committed crimes but these were not material to the German payment company’s financial position, an investigation by an outside law firm has found. Shares in Wirecard, under pressure since the Financial Times ran the first of a series of investigative reports in January alleging fraud and false accounting at the firm’s Asia-Pacific office, rallied by up to 30 percent on the news. Wirecard had at first rejected the FT’s reporting as “false, inaccurate, misleading and defamatory”. Yet in its final conclusions, Singapore law firm Rajah & Tann did find evidence that crimes could have been committed. “The review ... did not reveal findings of criminality in respect of the headquarters of Wirecard,” the company said in a summary of the law firm’s conclusions. “Criminal liability may, however, be attributable to individual local employees in Singapore according to local law.” ROUND-TRIPPING? The negative press coverage knocked billions off the value of Munich-based Wirecard, the top German company in the booming fintech sector, months after it ousted Commerzbank from the blue-chip DAX index. The FT based its reporting on a preliminary report by Rajah & Tann last May that examined a whistleblower’s allegations that accounting staff in the Singapore office carried out sham transactions, or so-called ‘round-tripping’, to pad revenues. These were not confirmed in the law firm’s final report: “The independent review had no findings of round-tripping or corruption,” Wirecard said. Singapore police subsequently opened an investigation and raided Wirecard’s premises in the city-state. The police probe piled the pressure on Wirecard and CEO Markus Braun - long the target of so-called short sellers who publish negative research to profit from any falls in a company’s share price. German prosecutors have, however, reacted by expanding ongoing investigations into suspected market manipulation. Germany’s markets regulator has imposed a temporary ban on short sales in Wirecard stock to steady the market. “This underpins our view that the whole negative stance from FT was exaggerated and once more created a strong buying opportunity for fundamental investors,” said Hauck & Aufhaeuser analyst Robin Brass. Detailing Rajah & Tann’s findings, Wirecard said the suspect transactions had not had a material on the company’s financial reports. Revenue of 2.5 million euros ($2.8 million) was wrongly stated in the 2017 annual report when it should have been booked for 2018. Further, an asset of 3 million euros was wrongly recorded for one week in 2018 and would not be recorded in the 2018 annual accounts. Wirecard said it would postpone the release of its 2018 annual report by three weeks to April 25 to allow time to take the law firm’s findings into account. The company confirmed guidance that its 2019 profits, measured as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) would be between 740 million euros and 800 million euros.

# Nets lose to Blazers in double overtime

PORTLAND, Ore. — The Nets did everything in their power to produce yet another of their trademark comebacks in an effort to string together three straight wins on their seven-game road trip. But after falling behind by seven points in the second overtime and creeping back within two in the final minute, they fell just short in a 148-144 loss to the Trail Blazers on Monday night at Moda Center.  The loss dropped the Nets (38-37) into a virtual tie for sixth place with the Pistons (37-36) in the Eastern Conference, with Detroit holding a slight edge in terms of winning percentage. The Nets’ magic number to qualify for the playoffs remains at six against both the ninth-place Magic and 10th-place Hornets.  D’Angelo Russell topped the Nets with 39 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, and they got 22 points from Spencer Dinwiddie and 18 from DeMarre Carroll. Jusuf Nurkic had 32 points, 16 rebounds and five assists for the Blazers (46-27), but he was taken off the court on a stretcher during the second overtime after suffering a serious leg injury. Damian Lillard had 31 points and 12 assists, Seth Curry added 20 points and Rodney Hood had 18.  Down five entering the final period, the Nets opened with a 22-7 run spurred by eight points from Dinwiddie, and Caris LeVert’s jumper from the key with 6:07 left gave them a 112-102 lead. The Blazers made just four of their first 16 shots of the quarter.  A corner three-pointer by Maurice Harkless cut the Blazers’ deficit to 114-111 with 2:33 to go, and Lillard hit two foul shots to cut the Nets’ lead to 118-117 at the 1:13 mark.  After the Nets’ Jarrett Allen made one of two foul shots, the Blazers missed two attempts to tie it and fouled Russell, who made only the first of two foul shots for a 120-117 lead with 35.4 seconds showing. Lillard made a layup to get within one and Russell had the ball stolen by Curry. Fouled with 3.5 seconds left, Curry missed the first before making the second to tie it at 120. Russell got off a deep three before the buzzer, but it banked off the glass and front rim to send it to overtime.  During the overtime, Allen also fouled out, leaving the Nets with no true centers to defend the 7-foot, 275-pound Nurkic, who scored four points in a 10-5 burst that gave the Blazers a 132-130 lead. Dinwiddie missed a layup attempt but Joe Harris came down with the rebound, leading to a tying layup by Russell with 8.8 second left. Lillard got an inbounds pass in the backcourt and wound up taking a desperation three from 40 feet that missed to set up double OT.  The Nets failed to score on their first five possessions in the second OT and committed two costly turnovers as the Blazers focused on going inside to Nurkic against Jared Dudley. Nurkic put the Blazers ahead on a layup, but he later crashed to the floor trying for a putback with 2:22 left and had to be carted off the floor on a stretcher after suffering a serious left leg injury. The Nets chose Anfernee Simons to shoot the foul shots, and he made both for a 136-132 lead.  Russell then missed two shots and had a turnover on the Nets’ next three possessions before a corner three by Hood gave the Blazers a 139-132 lead with 58.8 seconds to go. The Nets cut it to 144-142 with 22.0 seconds left on Dinwiddie’s layup.  The first half was played on even terms and ended tied at 62. In their previous two wins over the Kings and Lakers, the Nets were able to turn up their defense when it counted late, and that was the challenge entering the second half. The third period featured six lead changes before the Blazers took a 95-90 lead heading to the fourth quarter.<end_of_turn>

# Kate Middleton FEUD: Everything you need to know about model Rose Hanbury - and THAT 'row'

Kensington Palace has denied reports the Duchess of Cambridge has fallen out with her Norfolk neighbour Rose Hanbury, Marchioness of Cholmondeley. Reports stated Kate wanted Rose “phased out” from her and Prince William’s inner social circle - but Kensington Palace has labelled the claims “inaccurate”. The alleged fallout focused on a group of Norfolk friends dubbed the “Turnip toffs”. According to The Sun, a source said: “It is well known that Kate and Rose have had a terrible falling out. They used to be close but that is not the case any more. “William wants to play peacemaker so the two couples can remain friends, given they live so close to each other and share many mutual friends. “But Kate has been clear that she doesn’t want to see them any more and wants William to phase them out, despite their social status.” The claims have been so upsetting that the pair have both reportedly considered taking legal action. Who is Rose Hanbury? Rose 35, will have been married to David Cholmondeley, 58, the 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley, for 10 years this June. The couple met in Italy in 2003 and got engaged in 2009, getting married the day after. They have twin boys Alexander, Earl of Rocksavage and Oliver, Lord Cholmondeley, plus daughter Lady Iris. Before marrying, Rose was a model for Storm agency. She was also briefly a parliamentary researcher for then shadow education minister Michael Gove. David Cholmondeley, who is Rose’s senior by 23 years, owns Houghton Hall in Norfolk and Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire. Houghton Hall was built for the UK’s first Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, who is also David’s ancestor. Rose also has impressive connections in her own family tree. Her grandmother Lady Elizabeth Longman was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in 1947. They remained friends until Lady Longman died in December 2016. How long have Kate and Rose been friends? Kate and Rose are believed to have been friends for more than a decade. They are both patrons of the East Anglia Children’s Hospice.<end_of_turn>

# A tip of the hat to the people who tow your car

Here’s your daily dose of sweetness:  It’s been a tough year to be a tow truck driver. Few people think kindly of the people who haul their cars away during snow emergencies. They’re just doing their jobs, people.  So it’s good to see one getting a little love for a simple act of concern and kindness.  In Boston, somehow, a man in a wheelchair ended up on I-90 in the portion that goes under the city’s Back Bay. That’s a sure way to get killed.  He was wheeling along the right lane. That’s when a tow truck operator took over. He could’ve kept going like everyone else. He didn’t.   — 7News Boston WHDH (@7News) March 26, 2019 “The tow driver possibly prevented a tragedy by shielding the man until we could get there, and we are glad the gentleman was not hurt,” a spokesman for the state’s department of transportation said.<end_of_turn>

# Chapecoense mourn death of reporter who survived plane crash

SAO PAULO: Rafael Henzel, a radio reporter who survived the crash that killed most of the Chapecoense soccer team in 2016, died of a heart attack on Tuesday, the Brazilian club said. He was 45. Globo reported that Henzel collapsed while playing football in the southern city of Chapeco and despite being rushed to hospital he died soon after.  A highly respected figure in the area, Henzel returned to his radio job after recovering from the plane crash. "Throughout his brilliant career, Rafael told the story of Chapecoense," the club said on its web site. "He was a symbol of the club’s reconstruction and he will always be remembered in the green and white pages of this institution." Henzel was one of six people to survive the crash, which killed 71 of the 77 people on board. The flight was carrying the team to the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final in Medellin when it crashed into a hillside. Three players also survived the crash.

# Congress could get Mueller report in April, Graham says

WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General William Barr has told the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that he's combing through special counsel Robert Mueller's report, removing classified and other information in hopes of releasing it to Congress in April.  In all, Mueller's investigation resulted in charges against 37 people and entities, with seven people pleading guilty and five sentenced to prison.(Source: ZUMA Press/MGN)  South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he had dinner the previous evening with Barr, who said he is willing to testify before Graham's committee after he sends the report to Congress. Justice Department officials said Tuesday that more information could be released in "weeks, not months."  Democrats, meanwhile, frowned at the waiting game. Rep. Elijah Cummings, one of six committee chairmen who have demanded the full report by Tuesday, said much about the path forward depends on whether the report backs up Barr's conclusion that Mueller found no evidence that Trump colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 elections. By Barr's account, Mueller made no finding on whether the president obstructed justice, a question now in Congress' hands.  "The president has now an opportunity for weeks, it sounds like, to do these victory laps," while Democrats wait on key decisions about investigating the administration, Cummings said.  Challenges lie ahead for both the Republicans and the Democrats who hope to deny Trump re-election next year. Both parties are readjusting their aims and strategies in the post-probe landscape, pivoting to health care and other issues that are more important for many voters, even with Mueller's full findings still unknown.  Graham said the attorney general is going through the report to take out grand jury material and classified information, neither of which can be publicly disclosed under the law.  Barr wants to make sure nothing is released that could compromise national security or intelligence sources and methods, Graham said. He said Barr also told him he wants to check with prosecutors who have cases associated with Mueller's Russia investigation. Mueller had referred cases to other federal courts as part of his probe.  Graham later told CNN he had spoken to President Donald Trump about the Mueller report, who said "just release it." Graham said Trump was unlikely to claim executive privilege on any of the material.  The attorney general released a four-page summary of Mueller's confidential report on Sunday that said the special counsel did not find that Trump's campaign "conspired or coordinated" with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election. It also said that Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation, instead setting out "evidence on both sides" of the question.  Emboldened by the end of the investigation, Trump on Tuesday strode into a high-spirited gathering of Senate Republicans, flanked by party leaders, saying the attorney general's summary of Mueller's report "could not have been better." GOP senators applauded his arrival, and he celebrated what he called his "clean bill of health." He showed an eagerness to move on, Republicans said, specifically to focus anew on repealing President Barack Obama's signature health care law.  At House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's own closed-door caucus meeting Tuesday, she urged rank-and-file Democrats to "be calm" and focus on the policy promises of health care, jobs and oversight of the administration that helped propel them to the House majority last fall.  "Let's just get the goods," Pelosi said.  Not that the Democrats are forgetting Russia and the 2016 presidential election. Many Democrats dismiss Barr's four-page summary as inadequate.  "I haven't seen the Mueller report. I've seen the Barr report. And I'm not going to base anything on the Barr report," said Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland.  Trump has said he "wouldn't mind" if the full report were released. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he's hesitant to agree to releasing information from Mueller that would "throw innocent people who've not been charged under the bus." He is blocking legislation approved unanimously by the House calling for the report's release.  The president seemed to have heeded advice from allies, including Graham, who encouraged him to use the political capital he's now gained to accomplish policy goals.  Pelosi's advice to Democrats to stick with the strategy that won them control of the House in 2018 was reinforced by Obama himself, who counseled freshman Democrats at a reception Monday night.  Obama advised the newly elected lawmakers to focus on constituents' hopes and concerns, while also identifying issues they feel so strongly about that they'd be willing to lose their House seats in fights over them, according to people at the private party.  The focus must go beyond Russia and collusion, Democratic leaders said.  ___  Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Andrew Taylor, Catherine Lucey, Jill Colvin, Alan Fram, Mike Balsamo and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report.<end_of_turn>

# 4 Strategies To Shrink Employee Stress Levels

Over the last several decades, several studies have shown that stress is a significant source of concern for American workers. According to a new survey from Colonial Life, more than 20% of workers spend more than five hours on the clock each week thinking about their stressors and worries. An additional 50% of workers said they lose between one and five hours of work to stress each week.  When stress weighs on employees too long, the personal and professional costs add up. Unmanaged stress can have disastrous consequences in the workplace. Stressed employees often have trouble concentrating, struggle to stay productive, and are susceptible to burnout.  Fortunately, there are a variety of ways to address stress at your workplace. Traditional methods include anything from increased vacation days to flexible work hours to a positive office environment. All of these can help to tackle stress issues at work. But sometimes employers want to go a step further and truly make stress management a priority for their organization. Here are four specific ways that employers can reduce employee stress levels:    Massages  Massages in the workplace are a great way to fight the stress and anxiety that can build up during the workday. Some of the benefits of chair massages include reduced stress, decreased anxiety, improved overall mood and increased energy. Showing employees that they are valued with onsite massages is also good for business. It creates an atmosphere of teamwork, trust, and loyalty in the workplace.  Today, massages have never been more accessible. For example, Zeel, is an on-demand massage service that brings chair massages to your employees with just one click.“We just launched a self-booking tool that can have therapists onsite at your office or corporate headquarters in just a few hours," said Samer Hamadeh, CEO of Zeel. The massage therapists from Zeel bring and set up their own equipment, and you can plan ahead based on employee interest to make sure you get the right number of massage therapists and chairs to best suit the size and schedule of your team.  Mindfulness  Research has shown how practicing mindfulness regularly can help regulate emotions, change the brain to be more resilient to stress, and improve stress biomarkers. So it’s no surprise that many employers are now offering mindfulness programs.  One of the most popular meditation apps for companies is Headspace. Headspace helps its users to train their minds. Through meditation, employees can build up areas of their brains and actually rewire the brain to enhance positive traits. This can mean less stress, better sleep, focus and improved relationships. Research from Headspace has shown impressive results, including:  Sleep  We all need quality sleep. When the body is in sleep mode, it repairs cells and supports healthy brain function. When employees deprive themselves of sleep for too long, the results are disastrous. When the body is in a sleep deficit, it impacts everything from mood to physical reaction times. According to the World Sleep Society, 46% of individuals with regular sleep disturbances report missing work or making errors at work. Similarly, just as certainly as stress interrupts sleep, the lack of sleep can be a large source of stress. Better sleep can alleviate feelings of worry and anxiety.  Sleepio, a research-backed sleep therapy app, takes a personalized approach by allowing users to set goals, test their sleep and build a program to improve the amount of sleep they get. According to Sleepio data, their program helped 76% of people achieve healthy sleep. Large employers such as LinkedIn, Boston Medical Center and The Hartford are offering Sleepio to their employees.  Healthy Snacks  Stress can affect your employees eating habits by increasing the levels of stress hormones circulating in the body. These hormones can cause people to have higher cravings for high fat, calorie-dense foods, which can lead to weight gains over time. During times of stress and hectic days at the office, employees may think they don’t have time for a healthy meal. However, consuming fast food and sugary snacks will contribute to feelings of stress and anxiety even more.  Eating healthily is one of the best things you can do for your body during times of stress, so employers can support their employees by providing free healthy snack options. With a variety of healthy snack box subscriptions now available from SnackNation, NatureBox, Eat Club and WorkPerks, this is an easy strategy to implement. Workplaces can receive an assortment of snacks each month, satisfying employee hunger and boosting company morale.  There are plenty of ways to address stress among your workforce and it’s best to pick a variety of options and choose initiatives that will work best for your culture. Regardless of which strategies you implement, helping your employees manage their stress levels will have an impact on productivity levels and overall organization performance.<end_of_turn>

# Officials Reminding Residents of Health Risks During Flood Clean Up

Officials Reminding Residents of Health Risks During Flood Clean Up  SIOUX FALLS, S.D. – Flooding has left many with a mess to clean up but as residents start the cleaning process, there are health risks to watch for.  The main concern is coming into contact with contaminated water. Make sure no open wounds are exposed to water or you could risk a skin infection.  There’s also a risk of getting infectious diseases like E. Coli or Salmonella. So health officials say it’s important to wash your hands after cleaning up.  “If you get one of these infections it’s good ole viral Gastroenteritis type symptoms, but a lot of times if they’re bacteria related they don’t resolve very quickly on their own and can be a little more severe than you would experience in your typical stomach bug,” says Avera Internal Medicine Dr. Jennifer McKay.  Metal objects hidden by flood water increase your risk of injury. Health officials recommend you get your tetanus shot if it’s not up to date.<end_of_turn>

# NZ dollar slides as central bank signals possible rate cut

You are here  NZ dollar slides as central bank signals possible rate cut London  THE New Zealand dollar fell on Wednesday after the central bank flagged a possible cut in interest rates, becoming the latest to turn dovish in the face of slowing global growth.  The kiwi fell as much as 1.6 per cent. The Australian dollar also weakened, dropping half a per cent.  "The market was taken by surprise by the dovish tone (of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand)," Thu Lan Nguyen, an analyst at Commerzbank said. "Most central banks have turned dovish. Even those that hiked interest rates did it with a very cautious outlook on rates." The US Federal Reserve abruptly ended three years of monetary policy tightening last week amid signs of an economic slowdown. The European Central Bank, Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Japan have all turned dovish since. The kiwi fell to US$0.6794 after the RBNZ left rates unchanged and said its next move would probably be lower.  The Australian dollar weakened to US$0.7103.  Major currency markets were quiet elsewhere as risk appetite remained fragile after a selloff last week triggered by fears of slowing global growth.  The US dollar gave up earlier gains but held firm after US government bond yields bounced off recent lows. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was flat at 96.736 .  The euro rose to US$1.12758.  ECB president Mario Draghi said on Wednesday that policymakers could delay an interest rate increase again if necessary, but such dovishness has already been priced into the single currency, analysts said.  "Despite the dovish Fed last week, the trade-weighted dollar continues grinding higher as investors retain concerns about global growth and other central banks retain or shift towards a more dovish bias," ING analysts said in a note.  Emerging markets were mostly weaker. The Turkish lira fell another 1.4 per cent to 5.4028 lira per dollar after gaining earlier in the week, when local banks acted to support the currency.  The pound lost 0.3 per cent to US$1.3167 before steadying near US$1.32 as Britain's parliament prepared to vote on various Brexit options.  Parliament has taken control of the Brexit process from Prime Minister Theresa May for a day, and the lawmakers will vote on the Brexit options as they look for a way to break its deadlock over how to leave the European Union. GBP/ The Japanese yen rose 0.3 per cent, trading at 110.31 yen per dollar. REUTERS<end_of_turn>

# No more sale of lemon, syrup-based juices at CR stations in Mumbai

No more sale of lemon, syrup-based juices at CR stations in Mumbai  Mumbai, Mar 28: The Central Railway has banned sale of lemon and other syrup-based juices at food stalls under its jurisdiction after a video of such a drink being allegedly prepared unhygienically went viral on social media.  The video, apparently recorded by a commuter, purportedly showed a man using water from the tank placed over a food stall on a platform at Kurla railway station in Mumbai for preparing lime juice.  The person was also seen squeezing lemons in a drum and stirring the mixture with his bare hands. The video went viral on social media Monday evening after the commuter tagged it to the Central Railway's (CR) Twitter handle.  Central Railway's Principal Chief Commercial Manager Shailendra Kumar told PTI that lemon and other synthetically flavoured juices made my mixing water would not be sold at its stations now.  The ban, which came into effect on Wednesday, does not include fresh juices made by crushing fruits, he said. The decision was taken in view of the health risks for passengers consuming juices prepared in unhygienic conditions, he said.  "We can't deploy our staff on every station to monitor the juice-making process and use of water in it. Therefore, we have decided to stop the sale of these water-based lemon and synthetically flavoured juices," he said.  Earlier, the CR authorities on Monday sealed the food stall shown in the video. The stall's license holder was also called for an enquiry on Tuesday.  The CR network is spread over Maharashtra and also in some parts of Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.  PTI<end_of_turn>

The South Dakota Governor’s Cup has announced that nearly 400 of the top walleye anglers in the country will convene in the communities of Pierre/Ft. Pierre and Spring Creek Marina, July 19-21. “The Gov’s Cup is rooted in traditions,” said Curt Underhill, Co Founder of The Fishing Crew, and director of the South Dakota Governor’s Cup. “It began with legends like Bob Propst Sr., The Linder's, Ted Takasaki, Mike McClelland and Tony Dean battling it out for glory on the mighty Missouri. Now, it’s Gerrick McComsey, Duane Hjelm, Tyson Keller, and many other determined anglers who want to prove their standing within the walleye fishing community,” continued Underhill. In 1974, the South Dakota Governor’s Cup held its first tournament on the waters of Lake Sharpe. Fifty of the best anglers in South Dakota and beyond put innovative techniques and in-depth fishing knowledge to work setting the tone for walleye tournaments thereafter.

# Rockford schools 2 ballot proposals target facility needs, collaborative classrooms

ROCKFORD, MI – Rockford Public Schools has two tax proposals on the May 7, election ballot that would generate $185 million over 10 years to address growth, improve facilities, and promote innovation and collaborative learning. “Two years ago, the school board asked us to develop a 10-year master plan to handle growth with facility expansions and capital improvements, we got community input and took a $485 million wants list, and developed this $185 million needs list,’’ Superintendent Michael Shibler said.  Shibler and cabinet members have hosted dozens of informational meetings, emphasizing the bond and sinking fund requests won’t increase taxes because of retiring debt millage but decrease the rate 1 mill to 7.5 mills. The specifics of the proposals that combined would address the capital needs of the 8,000-student district are: A 30-year, $174 million school improvement bond to pay for long-term capital projects, including a new elementary on the West Side and expansion of four other buildings to address current and future growth. A 0.5 mill sinking fund millage for 10 years -- 2019 to 2028 – that would generate a total of $11 million with no interest costs to support district-wide capital improvement projects such as technology and security system upgrades, roof replacements, and HVAC systems. “This bond issue and sinking fund would allow the school district to continue to provide innovative programs and teaching and learning environments that will prepare our students well into the 21st century,’’ Shibler said. “For a district to be viable and progressive, we have to have financial opportunities to expand our facilities and make capital improvements.’’  The new elementary school that would be built just west of U.S. 131 in the Saddle Ridge community would reduce the population at Valley View Elementary, which has grown to 665 students. The school has five portables now and students share lockers because of the limited space. Approximately 160 students are bused from the Saddle Ridge area. Shibler said every elementary schools is at capacity, except Cannonsburg. Besides the new school, the district is planning to add additional classrooms or new space to four buildings to address enrollment including:  North Rockford Middle School, which currently has portables to assist with space Crestwood Elementary The Freshman Center Roguewood Elementary "We have money set aside to enhance the STEAM/STEM or Makerspace areas at all the elementary schools to complement the technology that’s there,'' said Assistant Superintendent for Finance Michael Cuneo, about money designated for K-12 innovating learning environments. He said district-wide schools would also see security and technology upgrades, collaborative learning furniture, and media center upgrades as well. Cuneo said the sinking fund would supplement the bond to bring a better value for taxpayers. How come the tax rate won’t increase with improvements but decrease? Cuneo said the current debt retirement millage is 8.5 mills but in July it will decrease by 3.5 mills to 5 mills. He said the two proposals, if approved would amount to 2.5 mills, resulting in a final tax rate of 7.5 mills. Cuneo said taxpayers will get cash back. For example, he said that 1 mill decrease for a taxpayer with a $300,000 home value means they would get $150 back a year. The bonds would be issued in three separate series over the 10-year construction period. The first series would include the new elementary, security enhancements such as more cameras and sensors to warn doors are open, buses, and improvements to the high school including:  Replacement and expansion of the tennis courts Pool upgrades Field improvements Mechanical and building exterior upgrades Rockford is among seven Kent ISD districts with tax proposals on the general election ballot, including Lowell, Byron Center, East Grand Rapids, Kelloggsville, Kentwood, Rockford, and Sparta. Lowell also has a bond.  For a complete breakdown of the bond series and sinking fund projects, visit the district website. Absentee ballots should have began arriving in the mail. Polls open May 7, at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.<end_of_turn>

# Man turning down Dodgers' offer to honor wife

Erwin Goldbloom, whose wife, Linda, suffered a fatal brain injury Aug. 25, 2018, when she was struck in the head by a foul ball at Dodger Stadium, told ESPN's Outside the Lines on Wednesday that the team contacted the family's attorney last week about a possible moment of silence at a 2019 game. But Goldbloom said he doesn't want any ceremony unless the Los Angeles Dodgers commit to increased protection at the ballpark. "We don't need their sympathy. We want action," Goldbloom said. "If they agree to make changes to improve safety for fans, then I'll go down there." A team spokesman told OTL on Thursday, "We don't have anything to announce at this time." There was no further contact from the Dodgers, Goldbloom said, after his lawyer conveyed his reaction to the idea of such a tribute. He said that in January the two sides reached an agreement through mediation over his family's lawsuit seeking damages, but the terms are confidential. The Goldblooms, married for 59 years, were in the loge-level seats they had for years through a partial season ticket plan when a San Diego Padres batter fouled a ball back to the first-base side of home plate. It soared just over the area protected by netting and hit Linda Goldbloom, who was taken by ambulance to a hospital and died there on Aug. 29, leaving three children and seven grandchildren. She was 79. The team did not make public what happened. In February, OTL obtained a coroner's report stating the cause of death as "acute intracranial hemorrhage due to history of blunt force trauma" from the impact of the baseball. Goldbloom and his daughter Jana Brody shared with OTL two letters they sent last month: one to a senior Major League Baseball official proposing increases in the height of stadiums' safety netting and the establishment of a fund to aid injured fans and their families, and one to the Major League Baseball Players Association seeking support of such efforts. They said they have not received replies to either letter. An MLB spokesman told OTL on Thursday, "We received the letter from the Goldbloom family and are aware that the Dodgers have been communicating directly with the family regarding this tragedy." Former major leaguer Tony Clark, executive director of the players' association, said Thursday in a statement to OTL: "Players have for a very long time advocated for increased use of netting and other measures to improve fan safety at games." Unlike many Dodgers fans, said Goldbloom, he and his wife didn't leave games early and were still present in the ninth inning, when the tragic accident occurred. He said he began attending big league games at age 4, when he was taken to see the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. Asked if he envisions going to any more games, Goldbloom said, "Right now, no."<end_of_turn>

# Rumour Mill: Alex McLeish faces Scotland sack | Celtic manager development | Rangers make Morelos announcement

The latest Scottish football news, transfer rumours and gossip...  McLeish facing sack after grim start to Euro 2020 qualifying Alex McLeish could be relieved of his duties as Scotland manager by the end of the week following a nightmare start to the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign. SFA chief Ian Maxwell will wield the axe over “growing concerns McLeish is struggling to cope with the stress” of leading Scotland’s bid to reach a first major tournament in over 20 years. McLeish is set to hold showdown talks with Maxwell today and will likely be told of the decision to remove him “from the international firing line”. (Daily Record) Celtic manager ‘target’ approached by other teams Red Bull Salzburg boss Marco Rose, who has been linked with the Celtic job, has been approached by both Schalke and Wolfsburg in recent days, according to reports. The Bundesliga pair are understood to be impressed by his work with the Austrian side, with Schalke wanting an answer one way or the other from Rose in the next fortnight. (BILD/Kicker) Rangers announce Morelos documentary Rangers have teased a new documentary about star striker Alfredo Morelos on social media. The Colombian forward - who left his homeland for Finland as a teenager - will tell his story to Rangers TV, in a feature called Soy Alfredo (I am Alfredo). The preview clip showed the 22-year-old walking down the tunnel, saying: “It’s an awesome adrenaline. It isn’t fear or nerves. “I feel so much more motivated to do things right, to win, to get three points at home, to play well there, to prove to our fans that we are ready to give them a show regardless of who we are playing against.” (Various) Hoban open to Dons return Tommie Hoban is refusing to rule out a return to Aberdeen - but the crocked Watford defender insists he needs to focus on regaining fitness. Hoban played just nine games for the Dons as he suffered two injury blows. With his Watford deal up in the summer, Hoban said: “I loved my time at Aberdeen. The boys are great, the staff are brilliant and I enjoyed living up there with the family although it was shorter than we’d hoped. “I would consider going back if it was an option. I don’t know if [Watford] will offer me anything or not but it doesn’t change what I know I need to do. I have to focus on getting fit.” (Daily Record)<end_of_turn>

# Journalist Maria Ressa Arrested Again By Philippines

Asia Journalist Maria Ressa Arrested Again By Philippines Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email March 29, 20197:37 AM ET Matthew S. Schwartz Twitter Enlarge this image In this photo released by Rappler, CEO and Executive Editor Maria Ressa, second from left, is escorted by police after being arrested upon her arrival at Manila's International Airport on Friday. Leanne Jazul/AP hide caption toggle caption Leanne Jazul/AP In this photo released by Rappler, CEO and Executive Editor Maria Ressa, second from left, is escorted by police after being arrested upon her arrival at Manila's International Airport on Friday. Leanne Jazul/AP A well-known journalist critical of the Philippines government, who was arrested in February for libel, was arrested again on Friday. Maria Ressa has long been an outspoken critic of President Rodrigo Duterte, who has accused reporters of being "spies." Ressa says her arrest is reflective of a hostile atmosphere toward journalists in the Philippines, which has drawn condemnation from journalists around the world. Ressa was arrested at Manila airport shortly after she stepped off a plane from San Francisco, CNN reported. She was charged with an investment law violation after her media company, Rappler, was accused of violating the law by letting U.S.-based Omidyar Network invest in the company. The Philippines bans foreign investment of news media. "It's sad that this is the kind of welcome our country gives a journalist," Ressa told reporters. "Sad day for me, and apparently the Philippine government isn't satisfied with arresting just me; the fact that they also included upstanding, successful tech and education entrepreneurs and businessmen? This is a bad signal to send to the rest of the world." Maria Ressa released on bail, warns vs impact of arrests on business. Full story: https://t.co/hWX7FQRnnz pic.twitter.com/dCi6zapQuK— Rappler (@rapplerdotcom) March 29, 2019 Ressa says Omidyar has no say over the site's news operations, and argues that the government is targeting her because her site is critical of the administration. "The fact that the government continues to try to label us as criminals is itself criminal," Ressa said. "Every action takes us further on a descent to tyranny." Along with other journalists, Ressa was named as part of Time magazine's 2018 Person of the Year awards. "Ressa steers Rappler, an online news site she helped found, through a superstorm of the two most formidable forces in the information universe: social media and a populist President with authoritarian inclinations," Time wrote. "Rappler has chronicled the violent drug war and extrajudicial killings of President Rodrigo Duterte that have left some 12,000 people dead, according to a January estimate from Human Rights Watch." In February, Ressa was arrested and charged with cyber libel for linking a local businessman to illegal activities in a Rappler report published in 2012. "Not only was it published seven years ago, it was published months before the actual law we allegedly violated had even been enacted," Ressa told NPR's Scott Simon. "You can't have a retroactive application of a law that didn't even exist yet. So I used the term 'laughable' that night in detention. I came up with a new word. The word is 'travesty.' This is insane." As NPR has reported, Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo told local media at the time that Ressa's arrest "has nothing to do with freedom of expression or freedom of the press." According to the BBC, Rappler has had 11 legal cases filed against it since January 2018. "All we can do right now is hold the government to account," Ressa told NPR. "I don't think this is about me or about Rappler. Press freedom is the foundation of the rights of all Filipinos to the truth." maria ressa rodrigo duterte Philippines Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email<end_of_turn>

# Seattle-area weekend weather? ‘Hard to say.’ There could be thunderstorms, or not. But the cherry trees at UW will be gorgeous.

Canada and California are duking it out above Washington.  With two distinctly different jet streams battling for dominance over Western Washington on Friday and into the weekend, forecasters with the National Weather Service in Seattle are hedging their bets by saying, essentially, that almost anything is possible this weekend.  There could be showers and thunderstorms on Friday and Saturday in the mountain regions or conversely, it could turn out to be “a pretty nice weekend,” according to meteorologist Jay Albrecht.  Weather prediction has been difficult over the, past few days, Albrecht said, explaining that the Puget Sound area is being influenced by both a jet stream from Canada, bringing a dry weather system, and a jet stream from California, carrying moist air. Computer models, which usually tend to agree on an outcome, have stubbornly resisted alignment this week, he said.  “It’s still hard to say,” he said on Friday about the weekend forecast. “We’re going to play the middle-of-the-road game.”  Whether we get showers in the Seattle region this weekend or not, the models agree on one thing: Temperatures are likely to be in the lower to mid-60s, which is about six to eight degrees warmer than is normal for us in late March, he said.  Another near certainty is that by Monday, rain, clouds, and wind will return making “the nice weather we’ve gotten used to fade into our memory banks,” Albrecht said.  For the first few days of April, high temperatures are likely to drop down into our more typical 50s, he said.  “It will be interesting to see if April ends up being the opposite of March, which was the opposite of February, which was the opposite of January,” he said. January weighed in as one of the warmest on record, February was among the coldest and snowiest and March has been among the top 10 driest.  Albrecht said that, so far, April looks like it’s going to begin with good old-fashioned Seattle rain, a pattern we haven’t seen much this year.  Unhampered by the oscillating and unpredictable weather of the past week, the cherry trees that were moved from the arboretum to the Quad at the University of Washington in 1962 when Highway 520 was built are set to reach their full glory over the next few days.  On March 28, they were listed as being 65 percent in bloom on the university’s news page, which chronicles the history of the trees, notes their degree of bloom and gives tips on how best to view the spectacle. There is, additionally, a livestream video camera for those who want to peek at the trees without moving much.  “Temperature and amount of sunlight are the big factors that determine bloom timing,” campus arborist Sara Shores said in a UW article. “Once the trees reach peak bloom, then we hope that the temperatures drop and the air is fully still for two or three weeks. That will help the blossoms last longer.”  For more information on the trees, follow these links.<end_of_turn>

# NBA Rumors: Kings Could Offer Marvin Bagley III, Harrison Barnes, Bogdan Bogdanovic & Picks For Anthony Davis

The Sacramento Kings may have failed to end their playoff drought in the 2018-19 NBA season but the improvements shown by De’Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield gave them something to look forward to in the coming years. As of now, there is no doubt that Fox and Hield are both taking the right path to stardom. However, with the emergence of numerous superteams, the Kings must be aware that they need to continue surrounding their young core with quality players to have a strong chance of contending for the NBA championship title.  Aside from 2019 NBA free agency, the Kings could also seek for major roster upgrades on the trade market. According to Zach Buckley of Bleacher Report, one of the NBA superstars that the Kings could target via trade next summer is Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans. The Kings may not have a better collection of trade assets than the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics, they should still consider engaging in trade talks with the Pelicans in the 2019 NBA offseason.  Even without the inclusion of De’Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield, the Kings could still build an interesting trade package that can catch the attention of the Pelicans. In the proposed trade deal by Bleacher Report, the Kings will be trading Marvin Bagley III, Harrison Barnes, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and two future second-round picks to New Orleans in exchange for Anthony Davis.   “The lack of a first-rounder might kill this offer’s appeal to some, but Sacramento’s counter is that few packages will have a prospect of Bagley’s caliber. Even if history hates the fact he went ahead of Luka Doncic, that has plenty more to do with the latter than the former. When Bagley steps out of his shell, his potential looks almost limitless. His per-36-minute marks are an impressive 20.6 points and 10.5 rebounds.”  The Knicks might actually be out of the Anthony Davis Sweepstakes if they win the draft lottery https://t.co/iyIKOZ61mO  — Intl. Business Times (@IBTimes) March 27, 2019 As Bleacher Report noted, the “primary function” of Harrison Barnes in the deal is to match the Pelicans’ outgoing salary. However, Barnes could still be a great addition to New Orleans, especially if they still want to remain competitive in the Western Conference in the post-Anthony Davis era. The same thing goes with Bogdan Bogdanovic, who is currently averaging 14.0 points on 41.2 percent shooting from the field and 34.8 percent shooting from beyond the arc.  Pairing Anthony Davis with De’Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield will undeniably make the Kings an exciting team to watch in the 2019-20 NBA season. However, trading for Davis comes with a huge risk since he could become an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2020. If they fail to convince Davis to stay long-term in Sacramento, the Kings could end up throwing away their precious trade assets for a one-year rental.<end_of_turn>

# Plymouth is being taken over by bees

School kids in Plymouth will be making their own honey in a bid to boost the city's urban bee population.  Pollenize is a brand new Community Interest Company in Plymouth set up to tackle the growing environmental issue, which is only set to get worse, and have opened their first apiary at a city primary school.  Pupils at King's School, in Hartley, will be learning all about honey bees and their importance to our ecosystem by donning mini bee suits and getting hands-on.  Owen Finnie and Matthew Elmes, who set up the company in a bid to highlight the rapid decline of Plymouth's bee population and do something about it, will also be opening other apiaries across the city, which members of the public can have a hand in running.  The first apiary, at King's School, is sponsored by recycling and waste management company Alpha Logic and was officially opened last week.  Pollenize will also be using the honey to collect vital plant species data to inform future planting decisions in the city and beyond.  Owen, who is Plymouth born and bred and a sociology graduate, said: "Pollenize CIC is a social enterprise using technology and the power of community to combat urban pollinator decline. We are tackling a huge environmental issue on a local level."  Matthew, who studied environmental science at university, added: "It's important for us to bring attention to our urban environment, and how bees can be a vital part of us working alongside nature. Studies have shown that bees thrive in our cities because of the high diversity of flowers."  Pupils at King's will be taken out on inspections of the beehives throughout the beekeeping calendar - a great opportunity for pupils to learn outside and cover multiple STEM skills in the process.  And in April they will be installing two colonies of native but threatened ‘European Dark Honey Bee’ into the apiary.  Ben May from Alpha Logic, who sponsored the hive at King's School, said: "We are proud to support the local ecology and King's School with sponsorship of this hive - we know it will benefit the education of the future generation at King's School and send the message to the wider community about the importance of the bee."  Children have also been given packets of wildflower seeds to sow. These packets will be posted through people's doors in Plymouth to do the same, too.  Pollenize, which is receiving support and expertise from The Environmental Futures and Big Data Impact Lab, is encouraging the public to back the project by becoming patrons for a small monthly fee. As a benefit patrons can inspect the bees across the apiary network as well as getting local honey.  Matthew added: "The honey will be analysed for pollen types and future seed packet recipes will help increase floral richness in the city to benefit pollinator conservation in the city.

# Etowah County legislators may or may not dissolve Mega Sports Authority

ETOWAH COUNTY, AL (WBRC) - Etowah County’s legislative delegation may be planning to make some changes to the county’s MegaSports Complex Authority.  The authority is working on a large scale sports complex to house baseball, softball, soccer, and other sports fields that would, in turn, hold tournaments.  A state legislative bill being advertised currently claims to seek to “change the distribution of certain lodging and sales and use taxes from the Etowah County Mega Sports Complex Authority to the Etowah County Tourism Board,” and to “provide for the transfer of all assets and liabilities of the Etowah County Mega Sports Complex Authority and provide for the dissolution of the authority.”  The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Becky Nordgren (R-Gadsden), has not responded to a request for comment. Rep. Craig Lipscomb says the legislators do not, however, want to dissolve the authority, they just want the tourism board to be put in charge of marketing after the project is complete.  The Mega Sports Authority has purchased a large amount of land in Rainbow City and is preparing to cut down trees. Phase 1 of the project would build soccer fields by Spring 2020.  “Tourism can’t take over because bonds, closing and validation process has all been done in the sports authority name,” says authority member Craig Ford. “They would violate the bond process.”  Ford says changing the process would be expensive.  “It could cost taxpayers over 1 million--land acquisition, attorney fees, and bond process. The question is why would we do anything when we are about to clear trees and cut a road to help school safety, economic development and access to sports complex. This will be the first new road built in Etowah County in over two decades,” Ford added.  A summary of the bill is set to be advertised two more times.<end_of_turn>

# With a Little Help From US, Huawei Is Morphing Into a Devices Business | Light Reading

With a Little Help From US, Huawei Is Morphing Into a Devices Business News AnalysisIain Morris, International Editor3/29/2019Comment (0)Login50%50% Tweet It's official: Huawei is quickly morphing from a networks into consumer devices business. And the US-led campaign against the Chinese vendor seems partly responsible. If one thing stands out in the company's just-published annual report for 2018, it is that Huawei's consumer business, which makes handsets and other gadgets, has now overtaken its network-designing carrier division as the biggest contributor to sales, as Light Reading had anticipated. With headline sales up 19%, to roughly 721 billion Chinese yuan ($107 billion), and net profit rising a quarter, to around RMB59 billion ($8.8 billion), the switcheroo has been dramatic. In 2017, less than 40% of Huawei's revenues came from the consumer business, while the carrier division accounted for nearly half. The situation was almost reversed last year, with the consumer unit generating 45% of all sales and the carrier-focused unit delivering just 41% of total revenues. The remainder came mostly from the relatively small but fast-growing enterprise unit. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Donald Trump's other anti-Huawei minions can take some of the credit for this shift in fortunes. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the US-led security backlash against the Chinese vendor had any significant impact on Huawei's carrier business last year. Only Australia imposed a blanket ban on Huawei's involvement in 5G, although New Zealand's government forced mobile operator Spark to use an alternative supplier. Authorities in western Europe believe tighter security checks on network equipment are needed, but they have resisted Pompeo's call for a Huawei ban. In terms of telco decision-making, too, the impact seems limited so far. France's Orange will not use Huawei's 5G products in its domestic market, CEO Stephane Richard said last year. BT is stripping Huawei out of its mobile core but insists the move is related to a long-time internal company policy and not recent government pressure. Vodafone has similarly decided not to use Huawei as a core or transport network supplier in the UK and has paused the deployment of Huawei's core network products in other European markets, until there is more certainty about the security picture. Yet major Huawei customers such as Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia and Telefónica do not appear to have backed away from the Chinese company. And Huawei still touts more 5G deals than either Ericsson or Nokia. Despite all this, Huawei's carrier business shrank for the first time in years and was beaten by Sweden's Ericsson on sales growth. Revenues were down 1.3%, to about RMB294 billion ($43.8 billion), despite previous assurances by Ryan Ding, the carrier unit's president, they would grow 2-3%. The decline at a company that has thrived for so long at the expense of western rivals is a clear upset. But the blame probably lies with the market environment, and not the US. Finland's Nokia, whose product breadth is comparable to Huawei's, reported a 3% drop in revenues. Where the US backlash inadvertently but almost indisputably had an impact was on sales growth at the consumer business. Analysts who cover the smartphone market broadly agree that patriotic Chinese consumers have been turned off Apple, the only US handset maker of real importance, by US moves against Huawei, including the arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer. Instead of buying iPhones, the Chinese are seeking out domestic smartphone producers including Huawei, which last year overtook Apple to become the world's second-biggest smartphone company, behind South Korea's Samsung. You're invited to attend Light Reading's Big 5G Event! Formerly the Big Communications Event and 5G North America, Big 5G is where telecom's brightest minds deliver the critical insight needed to piece together the 5G puzzle. We'll see you May 6-8 in Denver -- communications service providers get in free! Generating about 60% of its revenues from the iPhone, Apple blamed a Chinese downturn when sales for its December-ending quarter missed original expectations by around $5 billion. Now Huawei has reported a whopping 45% increase at its own consumer business for the 2018 fiscal year, to about RMB349 billion ($52 billion). Of course, it is not just patriotism that has driven consumers toward Huawei's devices. Rather like in the networks market, it has gone from being a low-cost imitator to becoming a technology leader whose gadgets are increasingly revered. Shown off at this year's Mobile World Congress, its fold-out phones are at the cutting edge of the market (if a trifle expensive for most consumers). In areas like camera quality, battery life and processing power, its flagship smartphones are arguably the best in the world. Is this sustainable? Consumer replacement cycles are lengthening, according to most analysts, because consumers are not convinced the latest upgrades are a big improvement on what they already own. Having crammed so many features into smartphones, device makers have almost nothing left to add (that anyone has thought of). For all gadget companies, this year could be tough. For Huawei, the other risk is a ban on its purchase of US components. That measure was taken last year against ZTE -- after the smaller Chinese vendor was caught selling network products to Iran and North Korea in breach of US sanctions -- and nearly drove it out of business. Blocking Huawei's access to chips from the likes of Intel and Qualcomm could be devastating for its consumer business. The threat of a ban could partly explain Huawei's determination to produce its own ground-breaking chips and boost its inventory of product components. (See Huawei Boasts of Bullish Growth in 2018 Annual Report.) Michael Genovese, an analyst with MKM Partners, has played down that possibility. "Banning Huawei could lead to an actual shooting war between superpowers," he said in a recent research note, pointing out that China could retaliate by threatening US access to Taiwanese-made semiconductors. Others think China could respond by targeting other industries where it has trade leverage. But no one is sure. Huawei's smartphone surge shows punitive measures can have unintended effects.

# Toyota celebrates as local RAV4 production starts amid big changes

CAMBRIDGE – It’s a smaller launch, but Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada still took time to celebrate it Friday with help from Premier Doug Ford.  CAMBRIDGE – It’s a smaller launch, but Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada still took time to celebrate it Friday with help from Premier Doug Ford. The automaker marked the first RAV4 to roll off the line at its Cambridge plant with a ceremony and several speakers, including Ontario’s top politician – even though the company is shifting assembly of 50,000 RAV4 hybrid vehicles to a plant in Kentucky. The automaker with plants in Woodstock and Cambridge and about 8,000 workers announced it would start assembling the RAV4 in Cambridge after that plant lost production of the Corolla to Mexico. The RAV4 is also assembled at Toyota’s Woodstock plant. Toyota announced last year it was investing $1.4 billion in its Cambridge and Woodstock plants to assemble the RAV4, including adding a hybrid RAV4 that was to be made here for all of North America. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and then-Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, in attendance at that announcement, each pledged $110-million from their levels of government. Ironically, at that 2018 announcement Wynne lashed out at Ford, then the Conservative party leader, saying he would likely rip the Ontario government support as corporate welfare. The $1.4-billion investment was to see 450 new workers hired, as well as 1,000 co-op staff. But earlier this month the automaker announced it will shift to Kentucky production of a RAV4 hybrid it was making here for sale in the U.S., following a US$749 million investment in the plant south of the border. The Cambridge plant will continue to build hybrid RAV4s for sale in Canada, a small slice of the market since 50,000 RAV4 hybrids were sold in the U.S. last year, but only 8,000 in Canada. Friday’s Toyota celebration comes as Fiat Chrysler in Windsor announced 1,500 job cuts as sales of its Dodge Grand Caravan minivan and Pacifica slump. Also, General Motors has announced the closing of its Oshawa assembly plant and the loss of about 3,000 jobs by year’s end. The automotive sector is cooling, after strong sales for about 10 years. In 2017, 17.1 million vehicles were sold in the U.S. Last year, that total was 17.2 million. This year sales are expected to slow to about 16.8 million vehicles, says one expert, a decrease of 400,000 sales, or a two per cent drop.<end_of_turn>

# NBA news: LeBron James sent Kevin Durant message, Anthony Davis and Irving development

LeBron James sent Kevin Durant message LeBron James should forget about the Los Angeles Lakers landing Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard as Kevin Durant should be their No 1 target, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith claims. "If I'm LeBron James and I had to pick anybody out there: Klay, Kawhi, Kemba, Kyrie... it don't matter," he said on First Take. "The number one guy you want is KD for a multitude of reasons. Number one, the offensive arsenal that Kevin Durant brings to the equation, particularly as a perimeter shooter. "It's incredibly complimentary to the skillsets of the playmaker that is LeBron James. "Number two, his length, his athleticism, his willingness to defend certainly upgrade you in the regard - those are basketball reasons. "Here's the other reasons that are not such a given to other people. "Kevin Durant is probably about to tie LeBron James for championships... If you're LeBron, you may not want him to pass you. "Not only that, you want to prevent Kevin Durant going to the Clippers. "Because if Kevin Durant goes to the Clippers, particularly if he is joined by Kawhi Leonard, not only will the Lakers not win a championship in the LeBron James era, but the Lakers won't even be the story in the LeBron James era. "So there's a multitude of reasons that if I'm LeBron, why I want to go after KD and get him. "I don't think it will happen, not by a long shot, because I don't think KD would do something like that. "But if I'm LeBron and I had a wishlist... oh that would be it." Kyrie Irving to affect Anthony Davis plans Kyrie Irving will hold the key to Anthony Davis’ future this summer. New Orleans Pelicans star Davis is expected to join the Lakers this summer after a deal wasn’t agreed before the deadline. However, former NBA star Stephen Jackson claims Irving’s decision to leave or stay in Boston this summer could dictate whether the Celtics beat the Lakers to Davis. “That’s the biggest factor,” Jackson said about Irving’s future. “You don’t want to have Anthony Davis without Kyrie. “Nobody knows what Kyrie is going to do next season. Nobody has any idea. That will be a big decision maker for them. “If there’s any way you can get AD, whilst giving away one of those pieces but still keeping the core together, I think that’s a good move for Danny Ainge. “But you’ve got to give Danny Ainge props, he’s been doing some remarkable things in the last few years with this team.”<end_of_turn>

# Tiger Woods’s comeback win sets up last 16 showdown with Rory McIlroy

Tiger Woods’s comeback win sets up last 16 showdown with Rory McIlroy  Shane Lowry wins final group game to secure Masters invite  Rory McIlroy shares a laugh with his caddie Harry Diamond on the seventh tee during the third round of the World Golf Championships-Dell Technologies Match Play at Austin Country Club in Austin, Texas. Photograph: Warren Little/Getty Images  Rory v Tiger! The dream showdown in the WGC-Dell Technologies Matchplay at Austin Country Club in Texas is on – if a little early – with Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods set to go head-to-head in a last-16 duel after the two topped their respective round-robin groups.  McIlroy made it three wins from three with a comprehensive 4 and 2 win over his Ryder Cup team-mate Matthew Fitzpatrick to top Group 4, but Woods needed a helping hand from Aaron Wise to ensure his progress. Woods did his part with a 4 and 2 win over the big-hitting Patrick Cantlay and only progressed as winner of Group 13 after Wise did him the favour of out-dueling Brandt Snedeker.  For McIlroy – winner of The Players on his last competitive outing, and building up to his quest to complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters in just a fortnight’s time – there was never any doubt of his progress as he dominated his encounter over Fitzpatrick.  McIlroy rolled in a 10-footer for birdie at the second to move ahead, a lead he never relinquished. The Co Down man turned three-up and, although Fitzpatrick offered some resistance on the journey home, McIlroy closed out the match without needing to do too much on the Par-5 16th where his opponent’s tee shot found the hazard.  Although McIlroy and Woods have been paired together no fewer than 18 times on the PGA Tour, this will be their first ever matchplay encounter. “We’ve played tournaments together, battled each other down the stretch at events, but never in a matchplay situation,” said Woods, who felt the match-up would be “fun”.  Although the most recent time they shared the same fairways was at the Genesis Open in Los Angeles earlier this season, the fresher memory for McIlroy was last year’s Tour Championship in Atlanta where Woods beat him to the title.  “Hopefully I put up a better fight than I did in Atlanta,” quipped McIlroy. “It’s exciting for both of us. I’m definitely excited. I’m sure he is, as well.”  Woods trailed Cantlay by one hole at the turn – “ I just said, ‘keep plugging along, it’s going to turn’ and eventually it did turn, it turned pretty nicely” – and he won four of five holes on the homeward stretch to take control, the icing on the cake coming on the Par-4 13th where he holed his approach for an eagle two.  “I thought three was going to be the number to halve the hole . . . I just tried to get up there close and at least try and make a birdie and, next thing you know, it falls in. So, I’ll take it!” said Woods.  And although Shane Lowry failed to advance from his group, there was strong consolation as his 3 and 2 win over American Andrew Putnam ensured the Offaly man will remain in the world’s top-50 for Monday’s cut-off for qualification into the Masters at Augusta National.  Lowry – who lost to Sergio Garcia on day one, and halved with Masters champion Patrick Reed on day two – trailed Putnam through five holes but went all-square with a winning birdie four on the Par-5 sixth. Lowry rolled in a 10-footer for birdie on the 11th to move ahead and, although brought back to all-square at the 12th, he won the 13th, 15th and 16th to finish strongly and claim the all-important win that ensured he stayed inside the world’s top-50 and got that ticket to Augusta.  Garcia lost out to Reed in the final group match but – with Lowry defeating Putnam – still progressed, as he put it, “thanks to Shane”. Garcia will meet South African Branden Grace in the last-16.  Louis Oosthuizen, who earlier this week confirmed his place in the field for this year’s DDF Irish Open at Lahinch, defeated Tommy Fleetwood to ensure his progress into the knockout phase as winner of Group 11, while Tyrrell Hatton confirmed his matchplay pedigree with a win over fellow Englishman Lee Westwood to top Group 9.  EARLY RESULTS  (US unless stated)    Group 1: Hideki Matsuyama (Jpn) bt Dustin Johnson 4 and 2; Branden Grace (RSA) bt Chez Reavie 2 and 1. Group winner: Grace.

GIRLS’ TENNIS Western Slope Open At Grand Junction: Skip Wells had already witnessed history, and the day was only halfway over at the Western Slope Open, held at Colorado Mesa University’s Elliott Tennis Center and Canyon View Park. “For the first time in our eight years playing this tournament, we have all seven positions in the semifinals in the championship bracket,” the Palmer Ridge girls’ tennis coach wrote via email during a rain/snow delay that stopped action early Friday afternoon. By the time the action resumed and eventually concluded, the Bears had advanced six spots into Saturday’s finals of the event, which was postponed from earlier this month after rain halted action, the first adjustment in 30 years of the tournament. Singles players Keelie Bennett, Bali Fitzpatrick and Tessa Rothwell will play for titles Saturday, starting at 9:15 a.m., as will the doubles teams of Kate Douglas/Miranda Hauke (No. 2), Haley Karlen/Abby Kugler (No. 3) and Katie Betz/Charlotte Hauke (No. 4). The No. 1 doubles team of Jocelyn Romero/Lyna Truong will play for third place on Saturday morning. Palmer Ridge is among 11 schools in the tournament, which also has players from Poudre, Grandview, Denver West, Montrose, Steamboat Springs, Durango, Pueblo West, Fruita Monument, Grand Junction and Grand Junction Central. BOYS’ LACROSSE Pine Creek 5, Santa Fe Prep 1 At Santa Fe, N.M.: Cole Gramlich scored three goals, and Pine Creek didn’t allow a goal over the final three quarters as the Eagles ended a victorious, two-game spring-break trip to New Mexico by beating Santa Fe Prep. “Getting kids to practice over spring break is tough, and it’s was one of the biggest reasons we took this trip,” Pine Creek coach Dennis Rego said. “It’s the first time we’ve done this. When we come back, we get right into league play, and we’re in a tough league with Regis, Kent (Denver) and Colorado Academy. It’s nice to get out of here with a couple of wins.” Matt Weis and Peyton Wilson added goals for Pine Creek, which led 2-1 after one quarter and added goals in each of the final three stanzas. “We’re such a young team, but we just want to make ourselves better every game,” Rego said. “More importantly, it’s good to get those grinder games where the team has to come together and play as a team.” On Tuesday, the Eagles (3-2) downed Sandia Prep of Albuquerque, 13-2. TRACK AND FIELD Mickey Dunn Invitational At Grand Junction: Palmer Ridge’s Madissyn Moore (100 and 200 meters) and Jaydes Warwick (110 and 300 hurdles) each won two heats to automatically qualify for Saturday’s finals during action at Stocker Stadium. Earlier in the day at Grand Junction High School, Palmer Ridge sophomore Grace Szucs won the title in pole vault with an effort of 10 feet, 2 inches. Palmer Ridge is the lone Pikes Peak region entrant among 19 schools competing in the annual event, which resumes at 9 a.m. Saturday. Other top performances turned in by Bears athletes came from Scott Hardman (third in boys’ pole vault); Nathan Lemke and Alex Falk (fourth and seventh, respectively, in boys’ discus); and Abigail Dall (eighth in girls’ discus).<end_of_turn>

# South Dakota man's $89,000 bid wins tag for bighorn sheep

RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) — A South Dakota man bid $89,000 at an auction to win a chance to hunt bighorn sheep in the Black Hills.  The Rapid City Journal reports that it's the seventh straight year the state wildlife officials have auctioned off the tag to help raise funds for bighorn sheep research and development.  Game, Fish & Parks regional supervisor John Kanta says the event has raised an average of $83,000 a year. The first year the tag was offered, in 2013, it was sold to a Watertown businessman for $103,000.  Officials aren't releasing the name of the winner until the license is issued. Kanta said the person who wins the auction can select who gets the tag and Kanta said this year's top bidder may issue it to his son.  ___  Information from: Rapid City Journal, http://www.rapidcityjournal.com<end_of_turn>

# Take One For The Team

SUNDAY PUZZLE — In case you missed the puzzle notes: Drop one letter from each set of shaded (or circled) letters in the grid to name a Major League Baseball team. The letters thus removed, in order from top to bottom, will spell an appropriate answer at 76-Down. You might or might not be a die-hard fan of America’s pastime, but few among us have never been at least lulled by a baseball game on the radio or background television. It’s a game of finesse and expert choreography that, when beautifully played, looks simple and kind of sleepy in that very cool way. I think today’s puzzle, by Andrew J. Ries, has that vibe. There’s a lot of theme and multiple levels, but everything glides along seamlessly. Tricky Clues I did find this solve speedy (as a resolute slowpoke), but I got tripped up in several places by close guesses. I had “wily” instead of OILY (and made the change after getting EEL next door, a very OILY meat); I also had “act” for OPT, “tug” for TUB and “aha” for OHO. ARE NOT and ONLAY were tiny snags for my solve, but both are crossword regulars. 22A: I called foul over this little fellow once I’d narrowed it down. I remain largely ignorant of the BRO HUG, but it’s not a debut as clued, and the concept has been in headlines everywhere (including The Times), so I guess there’s no avoiding it. Why are there “bromances” and “brogrammers” and no “brugs” or maybe “brombraces?” 55A: I don’t remember this as a nursery rhyme but as a trick math problem: “As I was going to St. IVES, I met a man with seven wives …” 103A: This was a quite hilarious trick clue that referenced another finesse sport, or so I’ve heard — fishing. You can cast roles, but you can also cast bait or whatever you’re going to use to get a nibble on a FLY ROD. 10D: This is a debut and might be new to some, but it’s easy to figure out etymologically. I stumbled on this open-source Merriam Webster dictionary online looking for early instances of this word. There’s a reference from 2005 that’s not even sound-related, but I think of an EARGASM as when you really, really like a piece of music. 47D: You can use a tiny flashlight to explore a tiny cave, or negotiate a cramped closet, or you can use it in a medical way to check someone’s ears, nose or throat, where you should spot a UVULA. 56D: There are quite a few loose and direct musical references in this puzzle, like GOSPEL, TUNE, LPS, LIEDER, OLDIES, etc. This one was unexpected, if you took “pitch” in the spirit of today's baseball theme, and might keep you from thinking along the lines of TONAL. Today’s Theme There is an official lineup of nine theme answers running across today, easily distinguished in the grid by shading or circled boxes, depending on where you solve. The clues are straightforward, not punny. Your job is to solve them and toss a letter out of each to get a baseball team, then save those letters in order from top to bottom to get a nine-letter term that is used in baseball, in life and, certainly, in a life spent (even partially) concerned with baseball. There’s also a revealer, at 76D, to really drive everything home. If you know your baseball teams, this will definitely help you run through these entries, which tend to be pretty broad — I needed plenty of crosses for several. Since the theme was laid out on a platter, the difficulty of the theme clues was pretty de rigueur, as far as I was concerned, so no complaints. I think I had the fewest issues with the entries that had complete teams in their shaded areas, with an extra letter at the beginning of the end — these include 25A, 39A, 84A and 105A. I knew these teams and they made sense as parts of the answers to these clues. I also knew FRED SAVAGE off the bat (pardon the pun!) and CASTRO STREET, and the other two weren’t terribly obscure. I was a bit slower when confronted with less straightforward instances, and “my” team was the last to fall for me, oddly enough. I solved PAID RESPECTS and TELEVANGELISM without much issue, then PORT WINES and SCRUB SUITS with the help of some crosses. I don’t know why I got stuck on __ __ __ __ SAUCE, sitting on my couch in Queens about a 30-minute walk from Citi Field, but I did. I think of MEAT SAUCE as “red sauce” I guess. If you keep track of those extra letters in each highlighted area, you get the same word as you do when you solve 76D: SACRIFICE. In baseball, a SACRIFICE hit, either a bunt or fly, is when a player hits a ball that’s caught or fielded, preventing that player from taking a base and counting an out against him, but allowing another teammate on base to advance and possibly score. Constructor Notes This puzzle is a reworking of a 15x15 puzzle I wrote a couple of years ago for a now-defunct crossword service called Aries Xword. That puzzle used BUNT as the extra letters that needed to be removed to reveal the baseball team. While I liked the idea, BUNT works only from a baseball standpoint and not so much from a wordplay standpoint. SACRIFICE works much better as the bonus word, as this can explain the wordplay mechanism as well as tie into the baseball theme. This was a challenging grid to pull off, as it’s tough working with nine theme entries that need to be in top-to-bottom order. Getting SACRIFICE to cut through two of the themers was an unplanned bonus. I tried to space out the themers as much as possible so the crossing down entries wouldn’t intersect more than two themers. SPY STORY is the only entry that crosses three themers, and all told I like the grid that emerged considering the constraints of the theme. I know not everyone is a baseball fan, but this is one of those “stealth” sports themes — you don’t need any specific knowledge of baseball to solve the puzzle as the teams are hidden within common phrases. I hope this is an enjoyable challenge for baseball fans and wordplay fans alike! Remember, no crying! Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here.

# Elvis rocks Stanfield Moose Lodge

The Stanfield Moose Lodge couldn't help falling in love with Elvis impersonator Mark Stevenz. Stevenz performed to a full house on Saturday night as part of the lodge's effort to attract new membership and raise money for the charitable causes Moose International supports, from Christmas baskets for local families in need to Mooseheart, a children's home in Chicago. Stevenz started his career as an impersonator 12 years ago, when he sang an Elvis song at a karaoke bar in Vancouver, Washington. A local theater group was there, and approached him about playing Elvis in an upcoming play. "They said 'Try to look like Elvis,' so I started growing out my hair and grew these little bitty sideburns," he said. Stevenz loved the experience so much he started moonlighting as the King at weddings, nursing homes and birthday parties. Eventually he booked enough gigs to quit his day job in construction, and moved on to performing at resorts and casinos, including a two-year stint in Cancun, Mexico. He even appeared on the television show America's Got Talent, and he and his wife Nicky were featured in an episode of House Hunters International. "Elvis is my hero," he said. "I get to portray one of my heroes in life, and make people happy doing it." Stevenz said he watches at least one Elvis video per day to "stay sharp" and has picked up a lot of moves and tips for hair and make-up from fellow impersonators at Elvis competitions over the years. While he has placed in several competitions, he said his favorite award has been the "Heart of the King" at the Penticton ELVIS Festival in British Columbia, Canada. "I'm really proud of receiving that from my fellow Elvis brothers," he said. On Saturday night he performed a two-hour show at the Stanfield Moose Lodge, complete with the sideburns and white fringed jumpsuit. The show mixed together rock and roll classics like "Blue Suede Shoes" and "Jailhouse Rock" with soulful ballads like "Kentucky Rain" and "In the Ghetto." He worked the crowd, making jokes between songs and frequently leaving the stage to kiss hands, cheeks and babies or pose for a photo. During "It's Now or Never" he handed out long-stemmed red roses to women in the audience. "You've been a fantastic audience, and I really appreciate it," he told the crowd. Beverly Stewart, a member of the Women of the Moose for 35 years, was the one who got Stevenz to come to Stanfield after her granddaughter told her about seeing him perform. "I thought, 'I've got to get him to the Moose Lodge,'" Stewart said. "I called him up and he was all for it." During intermission she said she thought he had done a wonderful job so far. "I'm telling you, everyone loves him," she said.<end_of_turn>

# Chrissy Teigen leaves Outback Steakhouse waitress a $1,000 tip

After dining at an Outback Steakhouse in Ohio with some of her team and her daughter Luna, Chrissy Teigen left her waitress an insanely generous tip. Model, cookbook author, and mother Teigen tipped 21-year-old Mikayla Scott $1,000 on the receipt of her $193 meal. “I was so nervous I was going to do something wrong,” the Outback waitress told Dayton.com. “People kept saying you are going to get a fat tip. I was like ‘Oh my god, praise the Lord.” Scott told the publication that the 31-year-old Teigen, whose husband John Legend is an Ohio native, ordered a glass of pinot grigio and many appetizers, including the Steakhouse Quesadilla and one of the model’s well documented favorite menu items, the Bloomin’ Onion.For her main dish she enjoyed a crispy chicken sandwich. Scott reportedly shared the tip with her co-workers and plans to use her share for car repairs.<end_of_turn>

# Energy firms urge government to ensure climate talks 2020 are held in UK

Bosses at the UK's leading energy firms are urging the Government to ensure the UK is picked as the venue for key international climate talks in 2020.  Britain is bidding to host the UN climate change conference next year, the biggest since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015  Under UN rules the COP (Conference of the Parties) next year should be hosted by a European nation and take place in the first year the Paris agreement would come into full effect.  The conference will mark a crucial deadline for countries to comply with their commitments in Paris on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and move on to tougher targets for the decade to 2030.  If successful, the move would be a strong signal of the UK government’s determination to retain its role on the world stage after Brexit.  'Strong record of leadership'  In a letter to ministers and opposition leaders, the bosses of companies including Centrica, ScottishPower, National Grid, Drax, BP and Shell said hosting the UN meeting would give the UK an opportunity to be seen as a green leader.  In addition 162 MPs have signed a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May, saying the country's "strong record of leadership and ongoing commitment on climate change" makes it the ideal place to hold them.  Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry revealed last December that she had officially written to express the UK Government's interest in hosting the talks in 2020.  A decision on where in Europe to hold the "Cop26" talks at the end of next year is expected in June.  'Maximise the opportunities'  The UN awards the hosting of the COP usually by alternating among developed and developing countries, and different continents, though the rules can be flexible  In the letter from the energy giants - which also include Affinity Water, Anglian Water, Capita, GKN Automotive, Heathrow Airport and Innogy Renewables UK, business bosses back the British bid to host the talks.  "Hosting Cop26 would provide the UK with a platform to further develop and maximise the opportunities of the global shift to clean growth and showcase to the world the best of the UK economy.  "It would be the country's moment to build further support for an ambitious clean growth trajectory, underscore ambitions for a net-zero economy in line with the Paris Agreement, and set out the opportunity of economic renewal and enhancement through climate action."  One of the signatories, John Pettigrew, chief executive of National Grid, said hosting the talks would let the UK send a message to the world that "we are proud to take the lead in the fight against climate change".  "Our progress on clean energy has seen this country make international headlines; for example, when we recently went over a week without any coal generation for the first time since the 19th century. But we all need to do much more.  "This summit represents an opportunity to get the world to unite behind one of the most important challenges we all face and we look forward to working with the Government to bring COP to our shores," he said.  Lead signatory of the letter from MPs, Labour and Co-operative MP Alex Sobel said: "Having just announced a climate emergency, MPs from across all parties in the UK Parliament are keen to see bold action taken on climate change.  "Cop26 is a key moment when the countries of the world will also be looking to cross divides to come together and build on their climate change pledges.  "With its diplomatic weight and having passed the World's first Climate Change Act over 10 years ago, the UK is ideally placed to play this role, guiding even those less ambitious countries towards strong commitments."<end_of_turn>

# The reason Benjamin Mendy was absent from Man City's trophy parade

The only player who missed the event was France international Benjamin Mendy, who made just 14 appearances for Pep Guardiola’s men this season.  The left-back is reportedly in Barcelona receiving treatment at Dr Ramón Cugat’s clinic on a persistent knee injury, which he initially picked up against Manchester United back in November.  Since then the former Monaco man has suffered several complications in his recovery, resulting in him making just four more appearances in the rest of the campaign.  MOST READ IN FOOTBALL  In a bid to sort this issue out once and for all, Mendy is understood to have undergone key-hole surgery on his left knee.  He has also reportedly cancelled a summer holiday to complete extra fitness work and ensure that he is fully fit in time for the club’s pre-season tour to China and Japan, which begins in July.  Mendy started only five times for City in the 2017-18 season having suffered similar injury hell – damaging the cruciate ligaments in his right knee only two months after completing his £52million move from the Ligue 1 outfit.

# Rugby doing the right thing targeting football fans | Nigel Owens

Celtic Park last Saturday. Shortly before kick-off, the Guinness PRO14 final between Glasgow and Leinster.  With my fellow match officials I had travelled to the ground by taxi from our Glasgow hotel. We got out to walk the last bit as the taxi was unable to drive up the walkway to the stadium, so we had a proper look at the outside of this truly iconic football venue.  It really was a wonderful sight that got the butterflies going in my stomach of what was ahead.  Barriers had been put up, where thousands and thousands of fans were waiting for the team coaches to arrive. We walked through the crowd and they were clapping us as we made our way towards the front entrance, with many shouting 'Good luck Nigel'.  The one that really made me smile was the young lad around halfway up who shouted 'Have a good one Nige, and don’t mess it up,' which then bought a cry of laughter from the rest.  As we got to the door a security guard smiled at me and said, ‘Well, I’ve never seen a referee walk up to this stadium before.’  ‘And I’ve most certainly never seen a referee cheered like that before!’  We each laughed.  Don’t get me wrong. Had we been walking through the crowd after the game some of them might well have been booing me. You will always have the jeers from the losing team no matter how well you may have refereed the game.  But the build up was just part of the whole new experience. A top rugby match being hosted at Celtic Park for the first time and an opportunity for fans of the two sports, rugby and football, to enjoy something a little bit different.  There has been a move in recent times to take more of these rugby finals to football stadia.  Saracens beat Leinster at Newcastle’s St James’ Park to win the Heineken Cup a couple of weeks back. A year earlier Leinster pipped Racing 92 at the San Mames Stadium in Spain, home of La Liga side Athletic Bilbao.  In a couple of years’ time the European final will be staged at Tottenham Hotspur’s new ground in London. That’ll be some occasion, too.

There is talk of the PRO14 final going to Cardiff City Stadium next summer. That would be great news as it would give an opportunity for the Welsh supporters to go and see a final like that in our own wonderful capital city.  This is an attempt, I think, by the rugby authorities to broaden the game, take it away from traditional rugby playing venues, get more football people interested in rugby.  It’s a move I warmly applaud because anything that gets a greater number of youngsters involved in rugby surely has to be a good thing.  Celtic Park was certainly different. Not just for the players, but also for me as referee and for the fans of the two teams.  In fact, when I was flying up the day before the game from Cardiff airport I noticed there were loads of Welsh rugby followers on the flight, too.  They were going to Glasgow because they wanted the opportunity to attend a sporting event at Celtic Park and, like me, they weren’t disappointed by the incredible experience.  When you get to referee in iconic stadiums that you have never been to before it's a wonderful and exciting experience.  It is the same for the players and supporters too, no doubt.  The venue is famous, of course, for huge European nights, and Old Firm games. When you walk up the steps to the field, the two teams in front of you, it just feels so special.  You can just imagine how frenzied the atmosphere would be for a big football match.  Celtic Park reminded me so much of the Principality Stadium, in as much as the crowd are right on top of you and there is a greater feel to the atmosphere.  The stands are built upwards, rather than back, and there is the sense the fans are a lot closer to the action.  Some of other grounds I’ve refereed at aren’t like this, or have a running track around them. In the southern hemisphere, some are dual rugby and cricket stadia, the fans are far away and the atmosphere isn’t quite the same.  The Principality Stadium, on the other hand, never disappoints and Celtic Park didn’t either.  There were 47,000 inside, but it felt full, such was the noise.  The football grounds, like Celtic and Newcastle, are often smaller than places such as the Principality, Murrayfield or Twickenham and that helps to lend itself to incredible full-on atmospheres for finals like these.  I actually think it was the perfect way to finish an excellent PRO14 season - a record crowd for a play-off and an absolutely phenomenal match between the two best teams.  Glasgow topped their Conference, Leinster topped theirs. The intensity was incredible and it was kind of like a Scotland versus Ireland Test match, in so many ways.  A real credit to the PRO14 which gets unfair criticism at times but which, for me, is on a par with the English Premiership in terms of quality of rugby. Particularly the games between the top sides, which we had at the weekend.  When some of the lower ranked teams play, then of course those intensity levels are going to drop, just like they do in any rugby championship or conference. But the PRO14 has taken some big strides forward again this season and the weekend finale was part of that.  Yes, there are issues still, not least for some when games carry on being played during the international windows.  But there are pluses as well as minuses to that, I feel.  The biggest minus, of course, is that the teams are not fully loaded with their stars. If the top two are playing, that stands out. Supporters want to see the stars play every game. but this of course is not doable particularly on the player welfare front and quite rightly so too.  But to counter that, it is an opportunity for fringe players to get their chance and put down a marker for the bigger games when the international stars do return.  It is also an opportunity for other less experienced referees to take charge of games, while the rest of us are away on Test duty, which is essential for their development.  So it’s swings and roundabouts, but as a whole I think it’s been a great season. Good quality rugby, a huge amount of tries per match compared to other leagues and some really exciting play.  The play-offs, and European qualification, have brought an extra edge to the end of the season.  Just look at the recent Ospreys v Scarlets game as evidence of that, what was at stake in that particular game, the excitement about which of the Welsh teams would actually get into the Heineken Cup.  Judgment Day this year was also special with a lot at stake for the the four sides even though it was pride the Dragons were playing for. The quality of the two games really was up there.  That buzz of having something to aim for keeps things going to the end and the icing on the cake came at Celtic Park for the play-off final.  Leinster emerged as champions, but the game of rugby was very much the winner for me.  You can’t beat the great rugby stadia when full, particularly Test matches. Principality Stadium, the best of the lot in my view, Twickenham, Murrayfield, Stade de France, the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.  But reaching out to a different audience at football grounds is clearly working, judging by the record crowd we saw at Celtic Park.  It was a pleasure to be a part of that. Roll on next season.<end_of_turn>

# Warriors seek to bounce back after NBA Finals loss

TORONTO Confident despite losing their NBA Finals opener, the defending champion Golden State Warriors say they must hustle faster defensively and reduce mistakes to defeat the Toronto Raptors. Seeking their third consecutive title and fourth crown in five years, the Warriors had won 12 consecutive playoff series openers before falling 118-109 Thursday, gaining hard-earned wisdom for Sunday's game two. "We're down 0-1 but it's not the end of the world," Warriors guard Stephen Curry said. "We've proven our resiliency and ability to win games we need to, answer the bell and learn. "They obviously played well but our confidence remains the same. It's just come out, play hard, get game two and take it from there. "I like the vibe that we have in the locker room in terms of everybody focusing on what they need to do differently and the overall energy bump we need to have to go steal game two." Warriors coach Steve Kerr has stressed fast-moving defensive work because he sees familiar challenges in how the Raptors play. "Transition defence is where it starts. We were just careless getting back," Kerr said. "When you've got a team that can push the ball from a lot of different positions and plays fast, you've got to be vigilant every possession. "If anything, they remind me of us." Warriors forward Draymond Green, who took the blame for Pascal Siakam's 32-point performance for Toronto in the opener, vows a more aggressive style Sunday. "We can do a lot better in executing and there are some adjustments we can make," Green said. "I have to be more aggressive. Aggressiveness starts with me and everybody else will follow. If I'm on my heels, everyone else is on their heels. "All five guys got to do a better job of just being physical, being alert, and we'll be all right. "We're champions. We understand what it takes. People hold us to a higher standard, but we hold ourselves to an even higher standard." Curry, who has sparked Golden State's attack with forward Kevin Durant out with a calf injury, said a 10-day break between games and being unfamiliar with the Raptors contributed to the Warriors' loss. "The first half after that 10-day break it was a little bit sloppier than we might have thought and a little bit more rust that we had to shake off," Curry said. "I don't think it's that complicated what we need to do differently -- it's just play better, take away easy buckets for them and control momentum a little bit better." Green agrees the Warriors will be able to better compete against a team that has the speed and quick-strike ability of their reptilian namesakes. "We got our conditioning back," Green said. "It was a bit rough after 10 days off. Now we've got a feel for them. We know what we can do better. I like where we're at. Yeah, we lost but I think we figured some things out, and we'll be better next game. "Our rotation has got to be better. We've got to fly around a little bit more. We can still play better and I know we will." But the Warriors also have a new appreciation for the Raptors' speed. "They're very fast, a little faster than it even looks on tape," Green said. "They definitely have a lot of speed. It's different once you see it and once you feel it. "So now that we got a feel for it, we know how to adjust. We know how important it is." The Warriors accept that all of Canada, and much of the United States, want them dethroned. "People in the States are rooting against us because we beat all their teams," Green said. "When you're at the top, no one's ever cheering for you to stay there. They want to see you fall. That's just kind of the mind of most human beings."<end_of_turn>

# Recital promises surprises

Photo provided  The Command Performance dance studio will present its 30th-annual recital at the Ticonderoga High School auditorium.  TICONDEROGA | Dance instructor Marge Cross doesn’t want to give away too many surprises about this year’s dance recital, other than to say it will be notable for those dancers who are accustomed to appearing on stage — and those who are not.  “The guest group will be long-remembered,” she promised.  Her Command Performance Dance Studio will hold its annual performance on Friday, June 7, in the Ticonderoga High School auditorium, featuring more than 100 dancers area age 3 to adult. Admission is $3 and will go toward the Young Women Scholarship Program.  This is the 30th anniversary of the recital, although Cross said it doesn’t seem it.  “They come in here when they’re 3 years old and I blink my eyes twice and they’re seniors in high school,” she said.  The dance will feature multiple disciplines, including tap, modern, hip hop, aerodance, ballet, pointe ballet and gymnastics.  For many, dance becomes a serious and lasting part of their life.  “A lot of the kids you see running up the sidewalk (to the studio) are the ones who are serious and give a little bit more,” she said. “You know their whole heart is in it, and when they’re right there on stage it makes you tear up.”  It also provides a foundation for adulthood even if they no longer dance.  “Dance is fun and a good (athletic) outlet, but it is also a discipline,” Cross said. “It builds self esteem and confidence.”  When the little ones come into her studio as young as age 3, Cross said.  “They can’t even stay in a line.”  Slowly but surely, though, they begin to develop the skills and discipline to perform.  “When they get on stage you see how they are transformed, not only through dance, but in life — it’s humbling,” she said. ”I like my dancers to be well-rounded kids.”  And of course the kids have fun, enjoying both the modern music and the older, more graceful dances and ballet.  “If I can give them a love of dance and a belief in themselves, my job is done,” Cross said.<end_of_turn>

# Pompeo, Swiss FM in talks likely dominated by Iran tensions

Pompeo, Swiss FM in talks likely dominated by Iran tensions  BELLINZONA, Switzerland (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is holding talks with his Swiss counterpart that are expected to focus on Iran.  Amid rising tensions between Washington and Tehran that have sparked fears of conflict, Pompeo was meeting Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis in the southern Swiss town of Bellinzona. Switzerland represents U.S. interests in Iran.  Although the U.S. says it won't relent in its campaign to pressure Iran, President Donald Trump has signaled a willingness to talk with Iran's leadership.  Pompeo has been coy about communicating with Iran through Switzerland, but the U.S. has previously relied on Swiss discretion to do so.  The two were meeting at Castelgrande, a medieval castle in Cassis' home canton of Ticino, an Italian-speaking area of Switzerland near Italy's lakes region.

# Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she has always supported marijuana legalization, but is that true?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she has supported legalization of marijuana since Massachusetts voted to decriminalize the drug in 2008, but a New York Times fact check says this claim is exaggerated. The Times fact checked a number of Warren’s comments on the trail, as the Massachusetts Senator continues to rise in the polls for the 2020 race for the White House.  At a CNN town hall in April, a student asked Warren about her position on marijuana legalization and her evolution in thought since she was first elected in 2012. “So, actually, I supported Massachusetts changing its laws on marijuana. Massachusetts had decriminalized at that point and I thought it made a lot more sense for Massachusetts to go ahead and legalize marijuana, and I now support the legalization of marijuana,” Warren said, according to a transcript of the event. The Times says Warren “overstated” her past support here. In 2011, during a Senate primary debate at UMass Lowell Warren said she supported medical marijuana legalization, which was a ballot issue that year, but not recreational use, the Times notes. In April 2012 Warren declined to take a position on that same ballot initiative when asked by the Associated Press. Then in September 2012 she told hosts of Boston’s WTKK-FM she did supportmeical use of marijuana.  “You know, I held my father’s hand while he died of cancer, and it’s really painful when you do something like that up close and personal. My mother was already gone and I was very very close to my father. And it puts me in a position of saying, if there’s something a physician can prescribe that can help someone who’s suffering, I’m in favor of that,” Warren said in that interview, according to Think Progress. “Now, I want to make sure they’ve got the right restrictions. It should be like any other prescription drug. That there’s careful control over it. But I think it’s really hard to watch somebody suffer that you love.” In 2015, ahead of the Massachusetts ballot initiative that would eventually legalize the drug for recreational use, Warren told the Boston Globe she was “open to it.” “I think we’ve learned a lot,” Warren said, adding that Massachusetts should study other states that recently legalized marijuana recreationally. In August 2016, Warren would not commit to voting yes to the ballot question that legalized marijuana in Massachusetts that year in an interview with MassLive.  "What I just said is that I would be open to it because I think that the problem we've got right now in Massachusetts is that we've decriminalized it which makes marijuana available but there's no regulation over it for safety,” she said at the time. During her run for president, Warren has said repeatedly said she voted yes on the initiative and thinks the country should legalize marijuana.<end_of_turn>

# Security and health services equally important for nation: Rajnath

GHAZIABAD: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Sunday said security of health services in the country was as important as securing the borders of the country.  Addressing a gathering after inaugurating Yashoda Cancer Hospital in Sanjay Nagar and Raj Nagar area here, Singh noted the present set-up for medical services in the country was not “adequate”.  He said private investment in the sector should be promoted through public private partnership ventures.  The medical faculty (doctors and nurses) to population ratio was poor and needed urgent improvement, he said at the function, which was his first public meet in Ghaziabad after the 2019 Lok Sabha results were declared.  He said the Government is mulling over increasing the health budget. (AGENCIES)<end_of_turn>

# Mining millionaire sues for $37.5m after falling in Woolworths

Mining millionaire who demanded $37.5MILLION when he slipped on a wet floor at Woolworths is handed less than $250,000 Stanley MacDonald, 77, slipped on a wet floor in Perth's Floreat Forum in 2012 He damaged two spinal discs, injured his knee and bruised his calf in the fall Mr MacDonald sued for $37.5million and was last month awarded $250,000 A millionaire mining tycoon has been awarded around $250,000 after falling over in Woolworths. Stanley MacDonald, 77, sued for $37.5million after he slipped on a wet floor in Perth's Floreat Forum shopping centre in 2012. He damaged two spinal discs, injured his knee and bruised his calf. A millionaire mining tycoon has been awarded around $250,000 after falling over in Woolworths (stock image) Mr MacDonald, who made $100million from the $1billion sale of his mining company to Gina Rinehart in 2011, argued his injuries caused him economic loss. He said his pain impacted his quality of life and impeded his work duties, reported WA Today. Mr MacDonald's lawyers compiled 34 lever arch files of evidence, including records of his 'wheelings and dealings' in mining, to prove that he was affected by the injury. Under WA law, damages payments are limited to $200,000 - but a judge ruled the maximum could be exceeded and awarded him slightly less than $250,000. The case was protracted because Mr MacDonald was 'unable to sit and converse for long periods' with his lawyers,' the District Court of WA heard last month. This was due to his injures and also a spate of other medical difficulties. According to court documents, Mr MacDonald needed 15 operations since the start of the case. Stanley MacDonald, 77, sued for $37.5million after he slipped on a wet floor in Perth's Floreat Forum in 2012 (stock image) He was treated for depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, osteoporosis, kidney pain and irritable bowel syndrome. Mr MacDonald's lawyer described him as 'one of the most highly successful entrepreneurs in the Western Australian resource market.' The businessman was director of Giralia Resources for 20 years before it was sold to Gina Rinehart's Atlas Iron. He is an independent non-executive director of Zenith Minerals. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Woolworths for comment.<end_of_turn>

# First look: Moto Guzzi V85 TT

First look: Moto Guzzi V85 TT With its many pluses and affordable price point, this bike will appeal to seasoned riders as well as first-timers Get ready for change.  The new Moto Guzzi V85 TT, which stands for Tutto Terreno or all terrain in English, is a motorcycle with many pluses in terms of handling and performance for riders eyeing to enter this segment.  The Italian motorcycle will appeal to seasoned riders and first-timers without overwhelming them with too much power or unnecessary high-tech wizardry.  We know this because The New Paper got a first look and ride on the 853cc transverse 90-degree V-twin at the V85 TT's test launch in Khao Lak, Thailand.  The launch, the first ever in the region for the marque, brought even more good news.  The V85 TT's competitive price point will leave you with spare change for extras like panniers, lighter aftermarket exhaust pipes and perhaps an upgraded rear shock.  Most will know that prices for dual-purpose motorbikes with touring and off-road capabilities often hover above $30,000, making the dual-purpose category open only to those with deep pockets.  But the two versions available in Singapore - Enduro and Enduro Premium - will have a price tag of $25,100 and $26,200 respectively before COE and insurance.  THE RIDE  So how does the V85 TT ride?  Well, as this is only a teaser, we will keep it short.  With a 23-litre fuel tank that boasts a 23km per litre of fuel efficiency, it will take you to far-flung places before its low fuel light comes on.  Weighing 208kg dry means you can still manoeuvre the V85 TT, equipped with three riding modes - Road, Rain and Off-Road - without too much difficulty.  On the road, the V85 TT, armed with anti-lock brakes, shows off its agility as it dodges potholes, including wildlife and the occasional reversing lorry that strays onto the road.  What is hard to forget is the signature throaty exhaust growl when you throttle hard from 4,000rpm towards redline territory past 7,500rpm.  While acceleration may not be blindingly fast, it is still robust on the V85 TT, which churns 80hp and 80nm of torque at 5,000rpm.  Its upright riding position feels natural as the motorcycle has been designed with the majority in mind.  Our 220km test loop did not leave my body aching despite nearly losing balance at one of two stream crossings.  But I realised that all it needed was more throttle and faith that the suspension would soak up the bumps from riding over unseen rocks.  If given a choice, my money would be on the yellow or red-coloured V85 TT.  The yellow with red trellis frame V85 TT is iconic as it hints at Moto Guzzi's past forays in the gruelling Paris-Dakar races.  Stay tuned for a more complete ride report.<end_of_turn>

# Elton John slams Russian censors over Rocketman cuts

The Guardian report that around five minutes of the movie have been removed due to the nation’s laws regarding “homosexual propaganda” with Russian film critic Anton Dolin first bringing the situation to light. He said that “all scenes with kissing, sex and oral sex between men” had been cut, while the on-screen caption at the end which says Elton and his husband David Furnish were raising their children together, has been changed to say that the singer, songwriter set up an Aids foundation and that he’s still writing with his musical partner. It’s also reported that scenes of drug use have also been removed. The joint statement reads: “We reject in the strongest possible terms the decision to pander to local laws and censor Rocketman for the Russian market – a move we were unaware of until today. “Paramount Pictures have been brave and bold partners in allowing us to create a film which is a true representation of Elton’s extraordinary life, warts and all. “That the local distributor has edited out certain scenes, denying the audience the opportunity to see the film as it was intended is a sad reflection of the divided world we still live in and how it can still be so cruelly unaccepting of the love between two people. “We believe in building bridges and open dialogue, and will continue to push for the breaking down of barriers until all people are heard equally across the world.” Last week, Elton said that some studios wanted to cut parts from Rocketman to make it more accessible for a younger audience, but he refused, saying: “I just haven’t led a PG-13 rated life.” Here's everything you need to know about Rocketman, while Classic Rock have also compiled the ultimate Elton John playlist.<end_of_turn>

# SYNGO Consortium releases public data resource for universal reference in synapse research

Synapses, the junctions that serve as specialized contacts between nerve cells, are the brain's fundamental information processing units. A loss of coordinated activity at the synapse lies at the root of many brain disorders (collectively called "synaptopathies"). However, to date, researchers have lacked any centralized, systematic repositories of information dedicated to synapse biology.  The SYNGO Consortium, a collaboration bringing together 15 laboratories worldwide and the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium, has released SYNGO 1.0, the first version of a knowledge base (http://www. In an accompanying paper in the journal Neuron, consortium members use SYNGO 1.0 to show that synaptic genes have changed little over the course of evolution (that is, are evolutionarily well-conserved), and are functionally much more sensitive to (that is, less tolerant of) mutations than other genes expressed in the brain. In addition, the authors also show that variations in many synaptic genes are significantly associated with such traits as intelligence, educational attainment, ADHD, autism, and bipolar disorder. Synaptic genes are also much more likely than other brain-expressed genes to bear mutations associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.  The SYNGO Consortium was established in 2015 by Steven Hyman and Guoping Feng of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge (MA), and is coordinated by Guus Smit and Matthijs Verhage of the Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research (CNCR) at VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and, for the GO Consortium, Paul Thomas at the University of Southern California.  A public knowledge portal  The transmission of signals from one nerve cell to another is orchestrated by a large collection of proteins located on the surfaces of the neurons on either side of a synapse, together encoded by probably a few thousand genes. Decades of research have provided "parts lists" for different types of synapses, as well as many hints as to how these proteins work together to drive synaptic functions. The SYNGO Consortium came together to synthesize this available knowledge and begin to provide an over-arching framework or model for describing it.  As a public knowledge base for synaptic research, SYNGO provides: A standardized framework of definitions (an ontology) for describing the functions, locations, and relationships of proteins and genes in the context of the synapse. Expert-curated, literature-based annotations linking synaptic genes and proteins to specific terms. Online analysis and visualization tools for evaluating the locations and functions of individual synaptic genes or to perform 'enrichment' studies. The SYNGO knowledge base portal allows researchers to: Search for synaptic proteins, find related proteins, evaluate the evidence for their synaptic localization and/or function, and use links to other information on synaptic proteins/genes. Analyze gene/protein sets from user-provided -omics data and discover a) how such data is structured, b) which proteins are synaptic, c) whether synaptic proteins are over-represented in such data, d) where proteins localize in the synapse, and e) what they may do. SYNGO web tools helps users to explore their data, and visualize the analysis results. SYNGO uses a machine-searchable format, and is fully integrated in the widely-used GO framework. Contribute new annotations for synaptic genes and proteins. "SYNGO is a unique resource," said Verhage, a member of the CNCR board of directors and head of the departments of functional genomics at Vrije Universiteit's Faculty of Life Sciences and the VU University Medical Center. "It is collectively supported by the international synapse research community, as the first all-inclusive ontology of the synapse. It represents all synaptic localizations and all aspects of synaptic function in a single ontology in an unbiased manner."  "The consortium built SYNGO exclusively based on evidence from published experiments that can be evaluated by users," added Smit, head of molecular and cellular neurobiology and chairman of the board at CNCR. "And its intuitive web tools provide users advanced analysis and visualization opportunities."  The SYNGO Consortium  SYNGO was initiated in 2015 with a meeting of international experts on the synapse at the Stanley Center that explored the possibilities of forming a consortium to generate a world-wide acceptable format for synapse ontology and annotation. Spearheaded by the CNCR, the GO Consortium, and the Stanley Center, SYNGO builds on prior initiatives generated in European synapse research consortia (i.e., EU-Synapse, EuroSpin, SynSys).  SYNGO's first activity was to partner with key opinion leaders in the neuroscience field to build a consensus ontology, annotation, and curation framework. The SYNGO database relies on the active participation of and knowledge contributions from the synapse biology community. SYNGO can only expand by the help of many, and to that end, the consortium has developed a web-based, transparent, open structure tool -- available at http://www. "The biology of synapses is critical to understanding the functional connectivity of the brain, which in turn underlies the functioning of the brain in health and disease," said Steven Hyman, director of the Stanley Center and a core institute member of the Broad. "By advancing the empirical foundations and creating effective processes for comprehensively capturing what we know about the synapse, SYNGO will help us identify patterns that might be otherwise invisible and accelerate the progress of neuroscience in understanding and addressing neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders."  ###<end_of_turn>

# STORE Capital: A 3.9%-Yielding Commercial Property REIT With A High Margin Of Dividend Safety

STORE Capital Corp. (STOR) is a strong DGI play for income investors that value long-term dividend growth more than immediate capital appreciation. STORE Capital Corp. has strong portfolio stats (perfect occupancy rates, high degree of portfolio diversification) and considerable excess dividend coverage. While shares aren't cheap, the REIT is in a good position to grow its dividend during the next recession. An investment in STOR yields 3.9 percent.  STORE Capital Corp. - Business Overview  STORE Capital Corp. is a large retail REIT with a sizable real estate portfolio in the United States. At the end of the March quarter, the commercial property REIT owned retail 2,334 properties reflecting 69 million square feet in 50 states.  Here's a portfolio snapshot.  STORE Capital Corp. has consistently reported impressive occupancy rates. The occupancy rate at the end of the March quarter was 99.7 percent, reflecting an improvement of 10 basis points over the previous quarter.  STORE Capital Corp. really looks good when it comes to diversification. In an increasing choppy market defined by growing downside risks (trade war, inverted yield curve), REITs with strong diversification stats have the potential to limit downside potential.  STORE Capital Corp. compares favorably against its commercial REIT peers in the sector: It has the most diversified tenant base (less cash flow risks) and longest lease terms (more cash flow visibility).  Source: STORE Capital Corp.  What further limits STORE Capital Corp.'s downside, in my opinion, is the presence of a large percentage of investment-grade rated leases. 75 percent of the REIT's leases are rated investment-grade quality (in-line with the past) which greatly limits the risk of a tenant defaulting on its lease obligations.  Source: STORE Capital Corp.  Cash Flow Growth  STORE Capital Corp. has two ways to grow cash flow: 1. Through acquisitions, and 2. Through rent bump provisions.  As to the first point, STORE Capital Corp. regularly spends a hundred million dollars a month on the acquisition of new properties that help the company scale. In Q1-2019, STORE Capital Corp. acquired new real estate for $393 million, which is about in-line with the REIT's past transaction activity.  Source: STORE Capital Corp.  Secondly, STORE Capital Corp.'s leases contain rent bump provisions which trigger organic cash flow growth automatically. The majority of leases (72 percent) call for annual rent increases.  Source: STORE Capital Corp.  Low AFFO-Payout Ratio  STORE Capital Corp. has no problems covering its dividend payout ratio with adjusted funds from operations. As a matter of fact, the AFFO-payout ratio is actually really conservative at 69 percent (rolling average last twelve quarters).  Source: Achilles Research  STORE Capital Corp.'s AFFO-payout ratio is the lowest in its peer group, which further translates into an improvement of the REIT's margin of dividend safety (AFFO payout ratio calculated based on consensus 2019 analyst estimate, FactSet).  Despite the lowest AFFO-payout ratio and a high margin of dividend safety, STORE Capital Corp. is the commercial property REIT with the fastest-growing dividend.  Source: STORE Capital Corp.  Guidance And Valuation  Based on $1.1 billion in projected net acquisitions in 2019, the REIT expects to pull in $1.90-$1.96/share in adjusted funds from operations this year. Since shares change hands for $34.22 at the time of writing, an investment in this commercial property REIT costs income investors ~17.7x 2019e AFFO which is an elevated multiple, but nonetheless reflects STORE Capital Corp.'s strong value proposition.  Risk Factors Investors Need To Consider  A U.S. recession would likely negatively affect the commercial real estate market and STORE Capital Corp.'s valuation. That being said, though, I don't see the dividend being at risk here: The REIT's portfolio stats are very solid and STORE Capital Corp. is in a very strong position to actually grow its dividend even if the market turns down. Valuation risk, in my opinion, is the single biggest risk factors investors have to account for.  Your Takeaway  STORE Capital Corp. makes a very strong value proposition for income investors that seek a quality DGI play in the REIT sector.  STORE Capital Corp. has excellent diversification stats, perfect occupancy rates, a high percentage of investment-grade rated leases, and a VERY low AFFO-payout ratio...which are all factors that support the investment thesis and limit the downside, in my opinion, especially in times of heightened market volatility. The dividend is sustainable, and has a lot of room to grow. Shares are not cheap, but for good reason. Buy for income.  Disclosure: I am/we are long O, NNN.

# Hilary Duff’s New ’70s-Inspired Bangs Are Seriously Cool

There’s a reason why there are so many memes about bangs. It’s a controversial hairstyle that can either look amazing or leave the person filled with regret knowing the grow-out will take forever. Luckily, it looks like Hilary Duff’s new bangs fall into the former category. The Younger actress switches up her hair all the time, adding extensions for length and highlights to brighten up her blonde. Though she’s tried bangs in the past, these are a 1970s-inspired style that feels super fresh.  The cut is courtesy of Duff’s longtime hairstylist Nikki Lee of 901 Salon in Los Angeles. “Hilary’s been toying around with the idea of bangs for a few weeks,” Lee said in a statement. “I just ignored her hoping she would forget about them! Haha! But today we just went for it and we’re so glad we did. Instead of doing a full bang we opted for more of a curtain bang that sweeps to both sides. The vibe is very ’70s and a perfect way to switch up her look.”  Duff herself calls her bangs “’70s summer bangers.”  These side-swept bangs are much more wearable than heavy straight-across styles. Duff can rock them to the sides or piecey in front. And the grow out will be super easy to blend into the rest of her hair.  If all this bang inspo makes you want to try them out for yourself, I say do it. It’s just hair. But know it’s a high maintenance style that requires constant attention. Okay, maybe get some clip-ins instead.<end_of_turn>

# Novel Sounds and Experimentation

CD Spotlight. A Very Joyous Disc - Brahms arranged by Kenneth Woods impresses Alice McVeigh. '... this is an excellent performance representing a useful, joyful and even inspired addition to the orchestral repertoire.' (Previous sponsored features returning soon.)    Havergal Brian (1876-1972) is undoubtedly Britain's most prolific twentieth century symphonic composer. Although largely self-taught and educated, Brian was extremely well read, and his literary tastes informed practically all of his output. Also, he was able to master German, French and Italian, so he could turn to poets and authors from these countries for a number of his stageworks. Still, when all is said and done, Brian's reputation rests almost entirely on his thirty-two symphonies, which he wrote between 1919 and 1968. Amazingly, the composer's fecundity grew as he got older, and the last 25 of these symphonies were composed during the last two decades of his life. This, in addition to a considerable number of other works in different genres.  The expansive Seventh was composed in 1948 and finds its inspiration from Goethe's autobiographical account of his student days in Strasbourg. But more so, the work represents a coming to terms with the reality of a glorious German cultural legacy that now seemed so tragically sullied by the horrific events of the Second World War which were still in everyone's memory. Maybe this is the reason for the strange combination of nostalgia and violent repudiation that seem fundamental to later portions of this emotionally complex symphony?  Listen — Havergal Brian: Allegro moderato (Symphony No 7) 
(track 2, 3:24-4:24) © 2019 Naxos Rights (Europe) Ltd : Between November 1959 and January 1961, after a two-and-a-half-year hiatus in which he wrote no music at all, the composer wrote no less than five symphonies (Nos 13-17), all short works but full of novel sounds and experimentation. Evoking ancient Greece and the savagery of the Persian Wars, the 16th symphony (1960) contains some of Brian's most dissonant harmonies and fearless utterances, and despite its brevity - fifteen mins - the work leaves a huge impact on the listener.  Listen — Havergal Brian: Symphony No 16 
(track 6, 14:14-15:14) © 2019 Naxos Rights (Europe) Ltd : The programme fittingly also includes the delightful comedy Overture The Tinker's Wedding, also from 1948, a sparkling piece of orchestration that soothingly alleviates the tempestuous angst of the symphonies.  Listen — Havergal Brian: Overture The Tinker's Wedding 
(track 1, 6:59-7:59) © 2019 Naxos Rights (Europe) Ltd : Alexander Walker and his Russian forces give passionately committed performances, highly idiomatic and bursting with excitement. Indeed, the music flows with an intensity that is never short of thrilling. Another fine instalment in the ongoing Naxos Havergal Brian series in brilliant sound and detailed notes.

# A Mayo weather reading that changed history

It is hard to imagine that a remote, windswept part of Co Mayo was the setting for an event 75 years ago that changed the course of history. Yet, for a few tense days in June 1944, the success of the greatest military invasion the world had ever seen depended on weather readings taken by a 21-year-old Irishwoman at the remote Blacksod weather station on the Mullet peninsula in Co Mayo. The resulting Operation Overlord — D-Day — was a major turning point in the Second World War. In the largest amphibious military landing ever, some 160,000 Allied troops landed on multiple beachheads in France to fight the Nazis. June 3, 1944, was a day of personal significance for Maureen Flavin, as she then was. It was her 21st birthday but, instead of celebrating with friends, she was busy taking barometer readings and collating weather reports by Ted Sweeney, the lighthouse keeper at Blacksod and the man she would later marry. Maureen sent her readings to Ballina, Co Mayo, where they were sent to Dublin, then to the UK meteorological office in Dunstable, 50km north of London. The commander of Allied forces, General Dwight D Eisenhower, had originally planned D-Day for June 5 but Maureen’s data threw his planned invasion strategy into chaos. According to her readings, a storm coming in from the Atlantic was set to hit the Normandy beaches 800km away in two days on June 5. Eisenhower was forced to mediate between opposing US and British weather advisers and generals. Nearly 5,000 ships and more than 11,000 aircraft would carry the troops into battle on the day across a 90km beachfront and into the interior of the Cotentin peninsula in Normandy. Because of the importance of the landings by sea and by air, June 6 and 7 were also pinpointed as possible dates because moon and tide conditions were suitable. Calm weather was needed for the landings and for air support. The troops would be carrying heavy backpacks, so if they jumped out of the boats in bad weather they would be turned over very quickly by strong waves. They needed clear skies for the bombers so they could see their targets. Without calm seas and clear skies, the invasion would have had to be delayed for weeks, giving Hitler’s troops time to prepare. Eisenhower decided to postpone the invasion and prayed for better weather. Less than 24 hours later, his prayers were answered by Maureen, who reported a rise in pressure which signalled there was going to be a clear window of weather on June 6. “I think Nazi Germany could not imagine in their wildest dreams would be crazy enough to make the assault on that day,” says the US general’s granddaughter, Susan Eisenhower. Maureen’s updated readings were passed on to General Eisenhower, who gave the signal to invade on that day. The Nazis were taken by surprise, as they had no weather ships in the north Atlantic and couldn’t see the pending improvement in the weather. “The weather information that the German had in the lead up to the D-Day basically suggest that a big storm was coming and it would be impossible for any Allied armada to land anywhere in northern France,” says Robert Gerwart, professor of Modern History at UCD. “Lots of senior officers, including Rommel himself, took a few days off. Rommel went to Germany for his wife’s birthday so, in this context, the much more accurate weather reading the Allies had proved to be a huge advantage.” Maureen’s role in altering the course of the war is detailed in a RTÉ documentary to be screened on Thursday, June 6 — the 75th anniversary of D-Day. In it, 96-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Cattini says the 160,000 men who landed in Normandy on D-Day owed a debt of gratitude to her. “We owe a lot to Maureen of the west of Ireland, us who invaded France on D-Day, because if it hadn’t been for her reading of the weather we would have perished in the storms,” says Joe. It was not until the invasion was well underway that Maureen understood the implications of her work. “She was completely oblivious to the decisions that were going to be taken in the next while that were at least partly dependent on what she was doing”, says Ger Fleming, former head of forecasting at Met Éireann. Although Ireland remained neutral in the war — or ‘The Emergency’ as it was known here — it was a form of benevolent neutrality as Éamon de Valera authorised the passing on of weather reports to the Allies, while refusing them to the Nazis. Maureen had never planned to be in the weather forecasting business. “I meant to go to America but I didn’t get that far so I went for a job in the post office instead,” she said. Speaking to the Irish Examiner, her son, Vincent, describes the journey she took at the age of 20 from her home in Knockanure, north Kerry, to Blacksod in Mayo. “My grandmother put an ad in the paper about a vacancy for a post office clerk and my mother answered it and came up,” he says. Vincent joined the lighthouse service in 1974, working offshore and taking over from his father as lighthouse keeper at Blacksod in 1981. “My dad’s mother, Margaret Sweeney, had the post office. Another aunt of mine, dad’s sister, Francis, also helped out with the weather reports that my father collated.” It was only when Maureen got to Blacksod that she realised part of her duties was to carry out weather observations for the Irish Met service, but she took it all in her stride. “There was no learning in that,” Maureen recalls. “You fell into it automatically. I didn’t like the night duty, though. I used to be afraid that the Germans would come in at night and come ashore.” Thanks in part to her efforts, that never happened. Storm Front in Mayo — The Story of the D-Day Forecast will be shown on RTÉ One on Thursday June 6, at 10.15pm.<end_of_turn>

# Strong ‘Into the Woods’ cast leads audience smoothly along an artistic trail of bread crumbs

OregonLive.com Magic beans. Glass slippers. Climbable hair. Those familiar fairy tale fixings make Stephen Sondheim's musical "Into the Woods" as instantly inhabitable as a Craftsman gingerbread cottage. Sondheim's trademark tongue-twisting couplets — always a test of an actor's lung capacity — are perfectly at home in playwright James Lapine's storybook mash-up. More than a parody of Grimm's greatest hits, the musical alchemizes archetypes into complex characters facing tough situations requiring compromise and teamwork. Mixed-emotions Cinderella, giant-stalking Jack, a childless baker and his wife, Prince Charming the Player and an overprotective Witch and her rebellious daughter, Rapunzel, all chase their respective tales in Broadway Rose Theatre Company's summer opener. Because the company's usual summertime venue, the Deb Fennell Auditorium at Tigard High School, is undergoing seismic upgrades, the show runs at the smaller New Stage. In this cozy version of "Into the Woods," the costumes, performances and vocals are larger than life and the music itself is scaled down … nearly to scales. There's a single upright piano, played by musical director Eric Nordin. Cast members take turns pounding percussive instruments throughout the show. Nordin conceived the stark sonic approach and like a glass slipper on a long-footed stepsister, it's a lovely idea that doesn't quite fit. On the plus side: The sparse arrangements give the tremendous chops of Baker's Wife (Leah Yorkston), the Witch (Erin Tamblyn) and Little Red Ridinghood (Hannah Sapitan) up-close immediacy. Tamblyn's ferocious big finisher, "Last Midnight," melts you like a bucket of water tossed on a wicked witch. Down side: It's three hours of piano music. Close your eyes and it sounds like you're in an all-night rehearsal. And it's such a beautiful Sondheim score. You miss the layered lushness of full orchestrations, especially for the ballads "I Guess This Is Goodbye" and "Stay With Me," which are rendered plinky and small. Another interpretive misfire: Director/choreographer Jessica Wallenfels adopted a commedia dell'arte angle that leans too far into camp and kinetics. It's a fable, not a farce. All the running, huffing and puffing nearly blows the carefully structured characterizations down – conspicuously in the first act. The jazz hands-y tone also diminishes the musical's darker themes. The Wolf (Austin Comfort) is madcap instead of menacing, so Little Red Ridinghood never faces a harrowing journey. The Witch isn't scary, so the heartbreaking, humanizing lullaby she sings to her daughter rings inorganic and unearned. The narrative demands darkness. That's why it's called "Into the Woods" and not "Vacation at Disney World." The heroes of this tale? The actors. The cast's nerve, verve and across-the-board artistry give the production its happily ever after. This may be the best cast Broadway Rose has ever assembled. Yorkston and her Baker hubby, Eric Michael Little, offer effortless chemistry anchoring the fantastical happenings. Tamblyn is a visceral vessel for every parent's fear and frustration about keeping their kid safe from the big bad world. Sapitan dials down the cute and pumps up the annoying perk and moral questioning inherent in this Ridinghood iteration. Tyler Andrew Jones' Jack never fizzles – even when reckoning with the consequences of his thievery. Kailey Rhodes makes the most of Cinderella's capricious nature, and we can't get enough of Josie Seid as Jack's mother. Broadway Rose co-founder Dan Murphy is a trustworthy Narrator and cryptic Mysterious Man. But the two princes, Comfort and Adam Elliott Davis, pretty much gallop off with the show. They're kings of swagger as they pursue Cinderella and Rapunzel – and whoever else stumbles in their sightlines. Comfort, an Ashton Kutcher lookalike, and Davis, who could double for Robert Downey Jr., transform their number "Agony" into a hunky Hollywood dream duet. Strengths: Darrin J. Pufall Purdy and wig designer Jane Holmes' over-the-top eye-confections pull inspiration from 18th-century finery, peasant garb, forest textures and, apparently, Skittles, judging by the stepsisters' pastel-hued pompadours. Most valuable performer: That's no wig, that's Comfort's natural incredibly long mane. His princely locks execute so many melodramatic tosses they deserve their own dressing room. Takeaway: Committed actors pave a sure path through an artistically muddled production. “Into the Woods" When: 7:30 p.m. Thursday-Saturday, 2 p.m. Saturday-Sunday through June 30. Where: Broadway Rose New Stage, 12850 S.W. Grant Ave., Tigard. Tickets: $20-$48; broadwayrose.org or 503-620-5262.<end_of_turn>

# ASK IRA: Should Heat pursue Suns’ No. 6 pick, if available?

Q: The Phoenix Suns are ostensibly willing to trade their first-round pick, No. 6 overall, for a veteran guard. The Heat likely have Goran Dragic, a veteran guard, on the final year of his deal (assuming he opts in). The No. 6 pick seems like a lot to give up for a guard like Dragic, who is on the last year of his contract, but do you think the Suns would bite on Dragic and another shot at Derrick Jones Jr. (who would represent a prospect with long-term upside) for the sixth pick? Or could you see the Heat trading the thirteenth pick, along with Dragic, for the sixth pick and salary cap relief, if the Heat have a conviction about a player at number six? -- Matt, Boynton Beach.  A: First, never confuse speculation with what a team actually is planning to do. So, for the moment, the talk about what the Suns or James Jones plan to do is pure conjecture. Beyond that, if the Suns believe there is any chance to nab Darius Garland at No. 5, then it would be foolish to deal from that spot. Beyond that, it would seem that trading such an asset for a 33-year-old veteran in Goran Dragic would be a stretch. And beyond that, Goran does not have to inform the Heat about his option intentions until after the draft. But since we're talking speculation here, I would go here: Assuming Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and R.J. Barrett go 1-2-3 in some order, I would at least give thought to trading Goran and No. 13 if it meant a choice of the player left between Garland, Jarrett Culver or De'Andre Hunter.  Q: I saw the article about potential trades for the Heat. Can the Heat go another route? I am a big DeMarcus Cousins fan. I believe he is a big whale that the Heat need desperately. He is the perfect big man for the NBA. He can shoot the three and punish you down low. I hope teams feel he is not worth the max because of his injury history. -- Roscoe, Coconut Grove.  A: Unless Goran Dragic and Hassan Whiteside both opt out, which is not happening, there won't be sufficient cap space. And after sacrificing so much to join the Warriors, I highly doubt DeMarcus Cousins would be content with the level of the mid-level exception the Heat will hold. Plus, it's not as if the Heat would be in contention with Cousins. Just don't see a match there.  Q: Some of you guys are beating a dead horse to death when it comes to developing these young guys. Justise Winslow and Josh Richardson aren’t leading men, and Bam Adebayo is not the second coming of Pascal Siakam. Why do you guys attach such expectations on these guys when it couldn’t be any more obvious they aren’t that good? -- Darryl, Fitzgerald, Ga.<end_of_turn>

# Kenya: Biodigesters Come to the Rescue of Students Who Lack Safe Toilets

For a year now, some 1,000 boys who school at Pokotomo Primary school in Kenya's Turkana County have not had a toilet after the facility they were using collapsed, forcing them to use the nearby thickets.  The 500 girls at the school share a two-door toilet.  This situation is worrying the head teacher David Namoru, who is now considering alternatives lest the school is shut down.  "It's against the law to run a school without a decent toilet for students. One of these days, public health officers will close the school," he said, adding that they may have to tweak the budget and spend money on locally available materials to build a toilet for the boys. It gets trickier as the soil is sandy, meaning only experts can put up a safe latrine.  Pokotomo's case is illustrative of the problem schoolgoing children, especially those in public schools, have to endure when it comes to sanitation facilities.  According to Kenya's National School Health Policy, new toilets are needed in 10,000 institutions across the country. In 10,000 other schools, they need renovation to meet World Health Organisation recommendations of a toilet for every 25 girls and one for every 35 boys.  A report on school toilets released by Water Aid earlier this year found that one in three schools around the world does not have decent toilets, and one in five primary schools and one in eight secondary schools do not have toilets at all. The report notes that children who lack decent school toilets are forced to run home at break time to relieve themselves or use the bushes around the school.  However, a sanitation programme started with the World Vision Kenya seeks to turn filled up toilets in the region into a source of energy.  "It is not easy to construct a new toilet but using a biodigester, we can drain the filled up toilets, which in return will generate energy for lighting the kitchen and laboratories," said Henry Kibet, World Vision Kenya, Wash co-ordinator in Lokichogio.  So far, some filled up toilets in 10 schools in the region have been converted into flush facilities, with their contents diverted through pipes to an underground biodigester.  A biodigester is a mechanised system that decomposes human waste in a tank using high graded bacteria further converting it into methane and water, which is discharged to the surface. The system comprises a prefabricated toilet shelter, a biodigester tank, and associated items such as overhead water tank, wash basin, tiles, squatting pan and urinal. It costs about Ksh10 million ($100,000) to install one biodigester.  The organisation has so far built two digesters and is planning to roll out the project to other needy schools.  The only challenge, Mr Kibet said, was the pupils' disposing of sanitary towels in the toilets, thus blocking the pipes.  "In future, we will consider building receptacles to dump the sanitary towels because when the pipes are blocked it brings down the whole programme," he said.<end_of_turn>

# A Louisville man impersonated an officer and pointed a gun at victims, police say

Let us answer your questions about Crime Stoppers, the citizen-driven crime reporting program. Nikki Boliaux, Louisville Courier Journal A Louisville man was arrested over the weekend after he allegedly impersonated a police officer and pointed a gun at victims on two separate occasions. Christopher Flannery, 28, was arrested Saturday afternoon and charged with first-degree wanton endangerment and impersonating an officer. According to an arrest citation, officers responded about 2:30 p.m. Saturday to the area of Interstate 265 and Smyrna Road on a report of a police impersonator. A victim told officers that Flannery was driving in a black Crown Victoria on I-265 with emergency lighting when he attempted to pull over a vehicle in front of him, according to the arrest report. The victim said Flannery then pulled alongside of his vehicle and pointed a gun at the victim before driving away. The victim was able to see the suspect's license plate and describe his face. Officers used the National Criminal Information Center to determine the vehicle was registered to a Mt. Washington address and later tracked down the previous owner of the vehicle. The previous owner said he sold the vehicle to Flannery and gave officers Flannery's name and address, according to the arrest citation. Officers tracked down Flannery at the provided address, and Flannery admitted to owning the Crown Victoria vehicle. He showed officers the vehicle that had the same emergency lighting equipment described by the victim, according to the arrest report. Flannery was also armed with a loaded handgun, according to the police. Police determined that on May 29, a police impersonator matching Flannery's description stopped and pointed a gun at another victim in a separate incident. According to a LinkedIn profile, Flannery previously worked as a deputy jailer at detention centers in Bullitt and Hardin counties. He also is an Army veteran and is the owner of Reaper Tactics, a security company, according to the LinkedIn profile. Flannery pleaded not guilty to his charges during an arraignment hearing Sunday. He does not have an attorney, according to online court records. Flannery remains held in Louisville Metro Corrections in lieu of $5,000 bond, and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 13.

# Apple TV will work with Xbox, Playstation controllers: Learn the details

The Apple TV ($169 at Walmart) has supported wireless gaming controllers for the past few years, but there are far better gamepads made for more robust gaming systems available. And starting with TVOS 13, you'll have two new options when it comes to getting your game on. The addition of two new controllers comes at a time when Apple is readying the launch of Apple Arcade, a gaming service the company first announced in March. Exact details are still unclear, but the gist of the service is this: You'll pay a subscription fee (still unannounced) for access to 100 new and exclusive games on your Apple TV, iPhone ($1,000 at Amazon), iPad ($249 at Walmart), and Mac. Expanded controller support is exciting. Not only will you have the option to use better hardware, but if you already have a compatible controller, it'll cost you nothing. Not to mention you'll already be familiar with the button layout. There are a few aspects of the new controller support that remain unannounced, but we've rounded up a list of controllers, what we think the setup will entail and theorize any limitations. Which controllers will work with Apple TV? The two new controllers join the already support Made for iPhone (MFi) controllers such as the SteelSeries Nimbus. What about the iPhone and iPad? Don't worry, while Apple didn't mention iOS and iPadOS 13 would add support, iPhones and iPads will indeed work with both controllers.  What about setup? The controllers will likely use Bluetooth to connect to your Apple TV. Meaning, initial setup will consist of putting the controller in pairing mode, and then adding a new Bluetooth device to the Apple TV. If you've ever added another Apple TV remote or an MFi controller, the process should be similar if not exactly the same. Are there any limitations? We don't know yet. Presumably, Apple will support the new controllers the same way it did MFi controllers, in that you're able to use them to do nearly everything on the Apple TV. For example, you can use a SteelSeries Nimbus controller to turn on the Apple TV, move through apps, select TV shows, and control playback. Another aspect that's unclear is whether or not features such as rumble and headphone-out will work when the controllers are paired to an Apple TV, iPhone or iPad. Where can I buy these controllers? Just about anywhere. Xbox, PlayStation and even MFi controllers are commonplace. Amazon is a good place to start, but be sure to check your local gaming store like GameStop for deals on used controllers. What about multiplayer support? We aren't sure. However, the Apple TV supports multiple MFi controllers right now, so it'd make sense for the continued support of more than one device.<end_of_turn>

# SMH: Youtuber Sentenced To 15 Months In Prison For Feeding A Homeless Man Toothpaste Filled Oreos

Youtuber Gets 15 Months In Jail For Prank On A Homeless Man  A Youtuber by the name of ReSet is facing some serious consequences for a prank he did on his channel back in early 2017.  After scraping the filling out of some Oreos and replacing it with toothpaste to give the cookiesto a homeless man, Judge Rosa Aragonés sentenced ReSet—whose real name is Kanghua Ren—to 15 months in prison. He also ordered him to pay €20,000 ($22,400) in damages to his victim and ordered that he shut down his YouTube channel and other social media accounts for the next five years. But as the New York Times points out, he’s unlikely to serve any time behind bars, since Spanish law normally allows sentences under two years to be suspended for first-time offenders in nonviolent crimes. ReSet chose to do this gag after being challenged by one of his followers to prank someone with toothpaste-filled Oreos. He found his unsuspecting victim–a man identified only as Gheorghe L.–begging outside of a Lidl supermarket in Barcelona, which is where he gave him the tampered-with cookies and a €20 bill. “Maybe I’ve gone a bit far,” the Youtuber reckoned in the now-deleted video. “But look at the positive side: this will help him clean his teeth. I think he hasn’t cleaned them since he became poor.”  After receiving criticism for that video, ReSet went back to the Lidl and found Gheorghe again, giving him another €20—and he also offered €300 to the man’s daughter, in an attempt to convince the family not to take legal action. “People exaggerate over jokes in the street on a beggar, when surely if it’s done to a normal person they wouldn’t say anything,” he said in a follow-up video.  But on Friday, Judge Aragonés ruled that the original Oreo video was “a clear and unambiguous act of humiliating content” which caused “physical suffering” to the victim. After learning that ReSet earned €2,000 in advertising revenue from the video, she ordered him to pay ten times that amount in compensation to Gheorghe.<end_of_turn>

# Social Ministry to push bills on senior citizens, transgenders

Social Ministry to push bills on senior citizens, transgenders As part of 100-day agenda, Modi govt has lined up a slew of welfare initiatives. As part of its 100-day agenda, the Union government has lined up a slew of social welfare initiatives for Scheduled Castes including a revamped Rs 10,000-crore post matric scholarship flagship scheme and Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana. The social justice and empowerment ministry would put the two legislations before the Cabinet and then begin the legislative process in the forthcoming session of Parliament. Social justice and empowerment minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot said, “The two Bills could not be passed in the 16th Lok Sabha so we would be re-initiating the legislative process. There would be no amendments and the two legislations would be tabled as planned.” Transgender Bill, which defines a transgender person and enunciates transgender rights, was not passed by last Lok Sabha. Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Amendment Bill has expanded the ambit of social security for the elderly by making distant relatives responsible for their upkeep, increased fine and imprisonment for abandoning parents and done away with the financial cap of Rs 10,000 for maintenance of parents. As part of its 100-day agenda till August end, the ministry would also move the cabinet to completely revamp its major welfare scheme – post matric scholarship scheme for Scheduled Castes. So far, the scheme was working on committed liability principle where the major financial burden was felt by the states. The centre would release funds at the end of a five-year plan and would only add a small share to the entire kitty. However, now the ministry has proposed that centre bear 75% of the financial burden and states fund a mere 25%. The ministry moved a note for approval of expenditure finance committee (EFC) and is likely to table the revamped scheme in the next cabinet meeting.<end_of_turn>

# Namibia: Meatco Launches New Brand

Meatco last Friday launched its export quality product on the local retail market. Meatco's primal cuts such as rump, fillet and striploin are now available for Namibians to experiment with the very same export quality that Meatco produces for international markets.  Jethro Kwenani, corporate communication officer at Meatco, says the official launch of the Meatco brand was already available at the grand opening of the Wernhil shopping centre extension on June 1 in the Food Lover's Market shop and was received with great enthusiasm.  "Our excellent quality meat products reach as many markets as possible, including the European Union, Norway, the United Kingdom, Reunion, China and selected countries in Africa. Now our own people will have access to the very same export quality cuts," he observes.  Kwenani said by penetrating the local market, Meatco will regain market share, as part of the Ministry of Industrialisation, Trade and SME Development's Growth at Home Strategy  aimed at diversifying the economy and encouraging local value addition and consumption.  "At Meatco we do not compromise on the quality of our beef. It is the best or nothing, at all times, in order to keep the trust our clients have in our meat. As the organisation's vision states: 'Meatco will have the most sought-after meat brands in selected markets in the long-term interests of stakeholders.' We put this to practice by guaranteeing that our clients get consistently high-quality products every single time," he said.<end_of_turn>

# Another day of strong to severe storms from the Plains to Midwest

Another day of strong to severe storms with heavy rain and the threat for flooding from the southern high plains to the Upper Midwest. Damaging winds and large hail will be the primary risk with an isolated tornado or two. Tomorrow the severe weather potential moves in the Mid-Mississippi Valley and Midatlantic. Meanwhile, a tropical system in the Gulf of Mexico still has the possibility for development, but the main problem will be heavy rain along the coast and inland later this week.<end_of_turn>

# Adm. William McRaven on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden

Adm. William McRaven oversaw the covert special operations team that stormed a compound in Pakistan in 2011 and killed Osama bin Laden. Now, the Navy veteran chronicles his 37-year military career in a new book, “Sea Stories: My Life in Special Operations.” Adm. McRaven talks to Judy Woodruff about his adventurous spirit, the one thing Navy SEALS must do to survive training and the value of NATO.  Read the Full Transcript  
                 Judy Woodruff:  It is the strike that made SEAL Team Six, a covert special operations unit, a household name. They stormed a compound in Pakistan, killing Osama bin Laden, in 2011. Admiral William McRaven oversaw the mission. He now details his 37 years in the Navy in a new book, "Sea Stories: My Life in Special Operations." Admiral William McRaven, thank you very much for joining us.  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  Oh, thanks. Great to be here.  
                 Judy Woodruff:  So this book is about much more than the raid to kill bin Laden. It's about your growing up as the son of a career Army Air Corps officer, going and choosing to go into the SEALs, the training you went through, getting into all kinds of scrapes as a boy, guarding Saddam Hussein. But I guess my first question is, where did this physical courage come from, this lack of fear?  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  Yes, I'm not sure it was a lack of fear, as much it was this kind of sense of adventure. I grew up, as you pointed out, in a military family. My father was a fighter pilot during World War II. And hanging around that Greatest Generation, these men and women that were children of World War I, children of the Depression, all the men went off and fought in World War II, and I would listen to their stories. And their stories were — they were poignant, they were funny, they were inspiring. Sometimes, they were a little unbelievable. But I will tell you, they were always stories of courage. And so, as a young boy growing up around these courageous men and women, I think that instills a certain courage in you and a certain sense of adventure. And that was one of the reasons I wanted to join the military.  
                 Judy Woodruff:  There's a mystique, of course, around the SEALs, and that whole — the training that they go through. And you write about how very hard it is, how most of the men who go through it don't make it.  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  Right.  
                 Judy Woodruff:  What sets apart the ones who do from those who don't?  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  Yes, it's really very simple. SEAL training really doesn't have a lot to do with how big and how strong and how fast you are. There's only one thing you have to do in SEAL training. And that's not quit. So, the one thing that defines everybody that goes through SEAL training is that they didn't ring the bell, as we say. They didn't quit. And that's really what you're trying to find in the young SEAL students, because, in the course of your career, you're going to be cold, wet, miserable. You're going to kind of fail often as a result of bad missions, bad training. And we need people that can persevere through all of that. So, while it is important to be physically fit when you go through training, you find out very quickly that your background, your social status, your color, your orientation, none of that matters. The only thing that matters is that you go in with this purpose in mind and this — the thought that you are just not going to quit, no matter what happens.  
                 Judy Woodruff:  Let's go back to the bin Laden raid. When those 24 — I think it was 24 men went off on those two helicopters, what worried you the most?  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  What worried me the most was the unknown. So, we didn't know whether or not the compound in Abbottabad, where we thought bin Laden was, we didn't know whether it was booby-trapped. So I was pretty confident that we could make our way from Afghanistan. It was about 162 miles into Pakistan. We had looked at all the intelligence. We figured we could get by the Pakistani integrated air defenses, and we could get to the compound. And I knew that, once the guys got to the compound, they were going to be successful. However, what we didn't know was, was bin Laden wearing a suicide vest, were the doors booby-trapped, was the entire compound loaded with explosives? We had seen a lot of times, in Iraq and Afghanistan, the guys had gone into compounds to get high-value individuals, and the entire compound had exploded because it was wired. This was the one thing we couldn't determine ahead of time. And that was the thing that probably worried me the most.  
                 Judy Woodruff:  I want to ask you about several things involving foreign policy. President Trump is today in Great Britain meeting with the prime minister and other — other things. My question is, this is an administration that's had some tense relations with our European allies.  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  Sure.  
                 Judy Woodruff:  How important is it, based on what you saw as a military officer, for the U.S. to have those strong relations with allies? Or can the U.S. go it alone?  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  No, the U.S. can't go alone. And I think our alliances are critical, not just with the Europeans, but in all sectors of the world. But NATO, in particular, of course, is an incredible alliance we have had really since the end of World War II that has really shaped the not only European theater, but the world. We cannot live without NATO. And when you take a look at what the NATO forces did, particularly after 9/11, I'm always quick to tell people they invoked Article V of the NATO charter, which says an attack on one is an attack on all. But I will tell you, it had nothing to do, in my opinion, with the NATO charter. It really had to do with the fact that we were friends, we were allies. We had been there for the Europeans after World War II, and they remembered that. And so, you know, NATO went with us to Afghanistan. The Brits, of course, came with us to Iraq. We have got to have those alliances. They are incredibly important to us.  
                 Judy Woodruff:  Iran. The Trump administration has been raising the alarms about Iran, beefing up U.S. military presence there. Was it the right thing to do? Has it benefited the U.S. that this administration decided to pull out of the Iran nuclear agreement?  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  Yes, well, I wasn't in favor of pulling out of the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear agreement. And while it wasn't perfect, certainly, I do think that it kept a little bit of the Iranian desires in check. And, certainly, it was going to push out their ability to build a nuclear weapon for some years. And I think that was all good. But I'm not particularly concerned about Iran. One, the president doesn't want to go to war in Iran. The Iranians certainly don't want us to go to war against them. We have been dealing with the Iranians for decades. The only concern I have with Iran — and I think interim Secretary Shanahan said it well the other day — is a miscalculation. If the Iranians miscalculate and think they can come after us, or if you happen to get a rogue Iranian naval officer that decides to get too close to the fleet, or somebody that decides to take a shot into the Green Zone, that would be a miscalculation on the part of the Iranians, and it wouldn't end well for them.  
                 Judy Woodruff:  You served several American presidents. We are upon the next presidential election. What are the qualities that Americans should look for?  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  Well, I had the great good fortune of working with George W. Bush in the Bush White House right after 9/11. And then, of course, I was one of President Obama's commanders. And, as I have said many times, I didn't agree with either president on a lot of issues, but what I found was, they were both men of great integrity and great character. And certainly, as a military officer, while you may not agree with a policy, it is much easier to follow the commander in chief when you know they are men of great character or great integrity, and you believe that they are doing what they think is right for the country. So I would offer that whoever is going to be elected in 2020 or whoever the candidates are, character matters. Integrity matters. And if you don't think so, then you have never led an organization, because let me tell you, leadership does start at the top. And if you have a bad leader at the top, it will affect the organization, absolutely. A leader needs to be driven by three things when he thinks about a decision: Is it moral, is it legal, and is it ethical? Those are three litmus tests for every decision that a good leader has to make. And if you fail to use that litmus test, then, eventually, you're creating this organization that is a house of cards, and it will collapse at some point in time. Good leadership requires good integrity.  
                 Judy Woodruff:  Last, you also worked with Joe Biden when he was vice president of the United States. Your take on him.  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  Well, I like Vice President Biden a lot. One, he is very frank. He is very warm. He is — I mean, he is a guy that will embrace you, you know, personally in a way that is — that's hard to miss. You know, he's great to be around. I will leave it up to the American people to decide whether or not he should be the right candidate. But, for whatever it's worth, I like Vice President Biden a lot.  
                 Judy Woodruff:  Admiral William McRaven. The book is "Sea Stories: My Life in Special Operations." Thank you.  
                 Adm. William McRaven:  Thank you very much.<end_of_turn>

# Browns RB Johnson still desires trade, where he’s ‘wanted’

Browns RB Johnson still desires trade, where he’s ‘wanted’  BEREA, Ohio (AP) — Duke Johnson came to Browns camp and made his feelings clear.  “I want to be somewhere I’m wanted,” he said.  Johnson doubled down on his demand to be traded Tuesday, saying he felt betrayed by Browns general manager John Dorsey, who began shopping the running back to other teams shortly after signing free agent Kareem Hunt.  The 25-year-old Johnson skipped the team’s voluntary offseason programs in protest, but reported for the Browns’ three-day mandatory minicamp. Moments after the team completed a morning walk-through, Johnson addressed the media for the first time since requesting his trade.  He didn’t pull any punches.  “I’m big on loyalty,” said the versatile Johnson, whose role was reduced last season following the arrival of rookie Nick Chubb. “I’ve felt as I’ve been loyal to this organization through it all, and the moment that I no longer have loyalty — and that’s even in my personal life, friends, family, the moment the loyalty stops, it stops on both ends. It’s not a one-way street. It stops on my end.  “Will that stop me from doing my job? Of course not. That’s not going to stop me. Me being upset and me being still wanting to be traded is not going to stop me from coming out here and performing at a high level.”  The Browns signed Hunt in February, taking on the controversial back who will serve an eight-game NFL suspension for physical altercations. Johnson’s agent asked Dorsey to trade him in March upon learning the team was already trying to move him.  “I was put on the trade block a month before I requested a trade,” said Johnson, who had a career low in carries (40) and receptions (47) last season. “That’s essentially my biggest issue. Again, my role since I’ve been on this team hasn’t been big for four years, not just last year. It hasn’t been for four years, and, again, I didn’t ask for a trade, didn’t complain, just came out and did my job.”  Johnson didn’t look distracted on disgruntled during Tuesday’s two-hour practice, which included the return of wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. “He ran hard, made some catches and looked like the same player who has caught at least 47 passes in each of his four seasons.  Early in practice, Browns coach Freddie Kitchens put his arm around Johnson and the two had a quiet conversation. A year ago, Kitchens was Johnson’s position coach.  Kitchens doesn’t think Johnson’s play will suffer.  “Duke practiced today, and he practiced hard,” Kitchens said. “I expect Duke to be a professional, and I think he will be. He’s never been anything but a professional. Whatever his personal feelings are, those are his personal feelings. I’m not going to dictate someone’s feelings. Duke’s a part of the team. All the other stuff is just hyperbole.  “I don’t know inventing. I don’t know imagining, or thinking or reacting or something like that. Just because we signed another good player doesn’t mean somebody else has to get traded. I mean, I love good players, and we’ve got some good players. Now we’ve just got to come together as a team, and I have a good feeling Duke will do that.”  Although he may be at odds with the front office, Johnson, who endured 1-15 and 0-16 seasons, vowed not to be a distraction to his teammates.  “I was here when we were 0-16,” said Johnson, a third-round pick in 2015. “I was all-in then. Nothing changes now. At the end of the day, I’m a professional, and again, since I’ve been here, you’ve not once heard about me not wanting to be here from coaches, players, anyone or just my attitude and being disgruntled.  “Last year, I was frustrated, at most, but as far as just being upset and not doing my job because of my feelings, you never heard of it, and you probably never will. I’m here to do a job, and I’m going to do that job for as long as I’m here.”  Johnson feels he has the support of his teammates.  However, quarterback Baker Mayfield doesn’t seem to be in his corner.  “Obviously, he’s going to handle his stuff how he wants, but you’re either on this train or you’re not. It’s moving,” Mayfield said. “You can get out of the way or you can join us. So it is what it is.”  Mayfield disagreed that Johnson’s situation is awkward.  “It’s not awkward,” he said. “It’s self-inflicted. It’s not awkward for anybody else in this building. He’s got to do his job. He said he’s a professional. I hope he does his job.”<end_of_turn>

# IMF Cuts China Growth Forecast On Trade Tensions

BEIJING (dpa-AFX) - The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday cut China's growth forecast for this year and next, citing downside risks and high uncertainty surrounding trade tensions, and said more policy easing may be needed if the conflict escalates. The lender lowered the growth forecast for this year to 6.2 percent from 6.3 percent seen in April. The projection for next year was trimmed to 6 percent from 6.1 percent. On conclusion of the IMF staff Article IV mission to China, the lender said it expects China's growth to gradually slow to 5.5 percent by 2024, as the economy moves towards a more sustainable growth path. 'The near-term outlook remains particularly uncertain given the potential for further escalation of trade tensions,' IMF's First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton said. Renewed trade tensions are a significant source of uncertainty, hurting sentiment, the IMF pointed out. That said, the Chinese government's planned policy stimulus can partially offset the negative impact from higher tariffs imposed by the US on $200 billion of Chinese exports, the lender noted. 'The policy stimulus announced so far is sufficient to stabilize growth in 2019/20 despite the recent US tariff hike,' Lipton said. 'However, if trade tensions escalate further, putting at risk economic and financial stability, some additional policy easing would be warranted,' he added. The IMF official urged the US and China to quickly resolve the trade tensions through a comprehensive deal that supports the international system and avoids managed trade. Last week, the World Bank trimmed China's growth forecast for next year to 6.1 percent from 6.2 percent, while maintaining the projection for this year at 6.2 percent. The lender slashed the global growth outlook for this year to a three-year low of 2.6 percent on Wednesday, citing weaker-than-expected trade and investment amid escalating disputes. Growth is projected to gradually rise to 2.7 percent in 2020 and to 2.8 percent in 2021. This week, Morgan Stanley warned that the global economy could slip into recession in nine months if the Donald Trump administration pushes ahead with a 25 percent hike in tariffs on the final US$300 billion of Chinese imports and triggers retaliation from China. And, economists at Goldman Sachs predicted that the likelihood of the US following through its threat of slapping tariffs on the final $300 billion of Chinese imports has risen to 60 percent from 40 percent. Goldman Sachs economists also expect further escalation as both sides add tariff and non-tariff measures. In May, the US raised the tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. China retaliated by raising tariffs on $60 billion worth of imports from the US. On Sunday, the China government released a white paper where it claimed that the country does not want a trade war, but is not afraid of one and was ready to fight if necessary, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. The US began imposing trade tariffs on Chinese imports last year and Beijing retaliated with similar measures. However, the spat does not end with just raising tariffs. Several Chinese firms, the most prominent being the telecom giant Huawei, have been targeted by the US. Copyright RTT News/dpa-AFX<end_of_turn>

# Office furniture firm Steelcase buys two Carrollton industrial buildings to grow its D-FW operations

One of the world's largest producers of office furniture and equipment has snapped up two huge Carrollton industrial buildings to grow its footprint in North Texas.  Michigan-based Steelcase Inc. purchased the two new buildings in the Valwood Crossroads business park at Belt Line and Luna Roads. The two warehouses built by Core 5 Industrial Partners contain more than 600,000 square feet.  Steelcase plans to use the buildings for manufacturing and distribution starting this summer. The company plans to hire almost 400 seasonal workers for the operation, according to Dallas real estate broker NAI Robert Lynn which negotiated the property sale. "Our company has been on a growth trajectory," Allan Smith, Steelcase vice president of global marketing, said in a statement. . "The location, along with the building's features, was the perfect choice as we made this acquisition." The Carrollton building purchases comes about a year after Steelcase purchased Plano-based Smith System Manufacturing Co., a leading manufacturer of school furniture. NAI Robert Lynn's Mark Miller and Dave Peterson brokered the building sales to Steelcase. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.  "The customized building enables Steelcase to expand its capabilities and support manufacturing growth for years to come," said Miller. Steelcase is a $3.4 billion company that's been in business for more than a century. The firm has more than 12,000 employees and has more than 800 dealer locations that sell furnishings for offices, schools and healthcare facilities.<end_of_turn>

# la-luz-del-mundo-church-leader-charged-with-child-rape-in-us

(BBC)The leader of an international religious organisation is being held in the US on charges of human trafficking, child rape and other felonies.  Naasón Joaquín García, who heads La Luz del Mundo (The Light of the World) church, was detained at Los Angeles airport, California prosecutors said.  Mr García, known as “the Apostle” among his followers, and his three female co-defendants are facing 26 charges.  La Luz del Mundo said it was confident Mr García would be proven innocent.  The organisation, which has headquarters in Mexico, says it has baptised more than five million people around the globe.  It claims to have at least 1.8 million followers in Mexico alone. However, only 188,326 people stated their religion as being Luz del Mundo, says Mexico’s official census (in Spanish) carried out in 2010.  In recent years the church’s influence has spread to the US, particularly in parts of California with large Hispanic populations.  What are the charges?  In a statement released on Tuesday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Mr García, a Mexican national, and the three women allegedly committed 26 felonies in southern California between 2015 and 2018.  These included human trafficking, production of child sex abuse images and forcible rape of a minor.  The defendants are accused of coercing underage girls into performing sex acts. The girls were reportedly told that if they went against the wishes of “the Apostle” they would be going against God.  “Crimes like those alleged… have no place in our society. Period,” Mr Becerra said.  “We must not turn a blind eye to sexual violence and trafficking in our state.”  Mr García’s co-defendants have been named as Alondra Ocampo, Azalea Rangel Meléndez and Susana Medina Oaxaca. They are all affiliated with La Luz del Mundo.  Among them only Ms Meléndez remains at large.  How has La Luz del Mundo responded?  In a statement (in Spanish), the organisation denied all the charges.  “We categorically reject the false allegations made against our brother Naasón Joaquín García,” the statement reads.  “In adherence to the Christian values our church preaches and practises, we reject any conduct which violates people’s dignity,” it added.  What is La Luz del Mundo?  The fundamentalist Christian organisation was founded in 1926 by Mr García’s grandfather, Eusebio Joaquín González.  It describes itself as a “resurgence of the early Christian church”.

# SOUNDCHECK continues June 15

PITTSBURG — The Colonial Fox Theatre Foundation is continuing the SOUNDCHECK series at 7:30 p.m. June 15, at the historic Colonial Fox Theatre in downtown Pittsburg. Admission is $5 at the door.   Concessions, including beer and wine will be available for purchase. The Colonial Fox Theatre is located at 407 N Broadway, Pittsburg. Doors will open at 7 p.m.  According to a release from the Colonial Fox Theatre, SOUNDCHECK is the brainchild of local singer/songwriter/touring artist, Lem Sheppard. This is an opportunity for local artists/bands and their fans to bring their jam to the mainstage of the Colonial Fox Theatre.  “When Lem came up with this idea I was immediately onboard,” Colonial Fox Theatre Executive Director Vonnie Corsini said in the release. “After all, why rehearse in your garage when you can play onstage at the Colonial Fox and invite all of your fans. Let’s just make it a party!” The June 15 SOUNDCHECK will feature local artists Left of Center, with Dennis Jamison, Clint Dodson, Brian Jackson, Anthony Dunaway and Jeff Sandness.  The band, Left of Center began at the 2016 City of Pittsburg 4th of July celebration. According to the release, the show sparked the beginning of their band and since then they have traveled all over the area playing clubs, parties and casinos. At its core, Left of Center is a classic rock band. They play music from the, 70’s, 80’s and 90’s hits as well as reworking popular pop songs into rock anthems.<end_of_turn>

# Afghanistan beats the world in depression, and it can barely cope

FC: According to Afghanistan’s Health Ministry, one in two Afghans experiences stress due to the war in their country, while thousands suffer from diagnosable illness including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, schizophrenia, extreme anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Although some of these conditions can be inherited, beleaguered doctors have little doubt that four decades of armed clashes, suicide bombings, and airstrikes have reshaped the country’s mental health landscape.

# 'There's no point going 'oh sure it'll be right when we get to Japan''

NO REST FOR the wicked. Days after his Ulster career was brought to a shuddering halt in Glasgow, Rory Best was back in training under Joe Schmidt’s orders. There was little time to dwell on the disappointment and there will be little time to switch off this summer.  Aside from a quick family trip to the Caribbean last week, the retiring Ireland captain is not thinking about holidays or time off as he bids to get himself in the best possible shape — mentally and physically — for what is to come over the next four months.   “It’s not the same conundrum for me,” he says. “I can take as many holidays as I want, hopefully after 2 November. It’s been about getting the break last week, getting away with the kids and freshening up and then keeping myself ticking over until we meet up [for camp] on 16 June.”  That’s when the hard work will start. Schmidt’s 44-man squad will convene for the first time on Sunday week for pre-season training, 98 days before Ireland’s World Cup opener against Scotland on 22 September.  It will be all systems go from there, with a warm-weather training camp in Portugal an important part of the summer, while Ireland will also spend time in Galway and Limerick over the coming months.  “I think the biggest lesson from 2007 was, don’t base yourself in one spot and sort of move around. It’s far better to move around,” Best continues.  “When you are together for so long, you have got to change it up. I think the one thing that Joe has done for the two World Cups is that he has based a lot of his training in Ireland, which allows you a good balance of getting home.  “If we have a day off during the week, especially in the Dublin camps, we potentially go home for those. But also getting across to Galway and down to Limerick — it’s just different venues but all within Ireland, so you can jump in your car and drive down.   You don’t have to go to airports and mess around. Obviously, we are going to Portugal, which it’s important to get a bit of heat too.”  Ireland’s preparations will intensify, and then conclude, with four warm-up fixtures in August and early September, by which point Schmidt will have whittled his squad down to the 31 chosen players.  After the disappointment of the Six Nations campaign, during which Ireland dipped well below their high and consistent standards under Schmidt as they slipped to chastening defeats to England and Wales, the summer series has taken on added significance.  Ireland will face Italy, Wales [home and away] and England in the build-up to the tournament and Best admits the team need to use those outings to regain their confidence and intensity heading to Japan.  “You’ve got to keep it in the back of your head that ultimately when you don’t fully commit to something you’re probably more likely to get injured,” the 36-year-old explains.   “The biggest thing for us, and those games traditionally don’t have as much intensity about them unless you’ve a team looking to make a point. It was 2015 when England beat the crap out of us. In fact, it was 2011 as well because we had stopped them Grand Slamming and they came to the Aviva and beat the crap out of us.  “You can generate intensity either if you’ve a point to prove or, like we have…we need to find a bit of form, we need to find a bit of intensity.”  Top of the agenda when the squad reconvenes later this month will be to identify the reasons why they started so poorly in Cardiff back in March and how they can avoid doing the same in Japan.  “We’ve got to look at why we didn’t start well because the last thing you want to do is go to the first game against Scotland, or even if you give Japan an opening like that with the atmosphere that’s going to be at that game, you just make life hard for yourself,” Best continues.  “We’ve got to see how we prepare. Because the Wales game kind of happened and we haven’t really been together because of all the European stuff, we haven’t had a good time to digest it. We’ve a good bit of time over the summer but we’ve got to look at what did we do differently in terms of our preparation that we got off on the wrong foot.”  It rocked you a bit, didn’t it?  “Yeah, it did,” the captain admits. “There are a number of things we’ll look at and it’s right across the board. I think we play best when we enjoy our rugby. Go out and bring physicality but ultimately we enjoy it and we get fired in. You look at the Grand Slam in 2018 and look at the comparisons, everyone looked like they were enjoying their rugby.   It comes with winning to an extent but you get to a point, yes you’re winning but the more you win, the more pressure there is and we looked like we were enjoying the pressure. But at the end of the thing [this year], it looked like the pressure was almost too much for us but it isn’t the case when you look at the big-game players we have. We’ve just got to address it.  “There’s no point going ‘oh sure it’ll be right when we get to Japan’ because if you have that attitude, like 2007, that’s when you come unstuck. I’ve heard a couple of players who played then saying ‘there are a lot of similarities to it’ but in my eyes, there isn’t. Because we now know we can’t just reproduce what we’ve produced.  “We kind of went into 2007 saying we’ll be fine when we get there, well we won’t be. Hopefully, we will be but we can’t just have that attitude, we’ve got to look at why, how and be big about it.”  Rory Best was speaking at the announcement of Bank of Ireland’s three-season partnership with Ireland’s leading LGBT+ rugby club, the Emerald Warriors. The announcement comes ahead of the start of the Union Cup, Europe’s biggest LGBT+ inclusive rugby tournament. The two-day festival of rugby will be held from 7-9 June at DCU.  The42 is on Instagram!

# More People Will Die as a Result of Texas’ Red Light Camera Ban

More People Will Die as a Result of Texas’ Red Light Camera Ban  We can expect more dead people on Texas roads, thanks to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who signed a bill last week banning red light cameras.  Time and time again, injuries and deaths have increased in cities that have banned automated traffic enforcement.  After Houston banned red-light cameras in 2010, for example, fatal crashes at intersections rose 30 percent, and overall crashes rose 116 percent, according to data provided by Houston police. In 2015, the city was named the most dangerous city for red light running in the nation by the National Coalition for Safer Roads in 2015.  A 2017 study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety analyzed what happened in 19 cities that shut off the cameras over the previous decade. They found that compared to peer cities that left them on, the fatal crash rate at signalized intersections was 16 percent higher.  The debate in Texas was dominated by people who felt victimized by getting tickets. But for the actual victims of red-light running crashes, the effects are pretty devastating. These crashes are fairly high-speed and often deadly.  Adrienne Patterson was struck by a red-light running trying to cross an intersection in Austin in 2013. She suffered a traumatic brain injury.  “I am different now. I am different than I was before,” she testified before the Texas Senate Committee on Transportation (at 2:20 in the linked clip) in March.  “Traumatic brain injury effects anxiety, coordination, socialization, exhaustion, personality, relationships, ability to function, depression, seizures, confusion, headaches, decision-making, contemplation, emotions and vision,” she said. “These are a few of the things I deal with on a daily basis.”  Prior to the ban, Austin had red light cameras, but only in nine locations. Local police report they have reduced crashes at those intersections 40 percent since 2013.  Texas already has some of the nation’s deadliest roads. About 10 people are killed on the states roads daily. In 2017, a total of 3,721 lost their lives. Still for the Texas legislature and Abbott, protecting people from fines is more important than protecting people from getting killed or injured by red light runners. I don’t expect them to be very circumspect, but we’ll soon see the result.  The Texas legislature was apparently influenced a lot by a study out of Case Western Reserve University that found red light cameras had no effect on traffic safety. The paper by Justin Gallagher, who is currently an associate professor at Montana State University, has never been published or peer-reviewed. And it’s an outlier, since most studies show red light cameras have pretty clear safety benefits.  “The entire state of Texas elected officials completely based everything they did on this guy’s work,” said Jay Crossley, of the nonprofit group Farm and City, which is trying to improve traffic safety in Texas.   I'm a supporter and think you do great work. But on this one I disagree. Red light cameras reduce fatalities. By removing this, you're encouraging people to run red lights and increasing serious t-bone crashes.  — Alan Boden (@UKFishguy) June 2, 2019 Neil Arason, a Canadian traffic safety expert, told Streetsblog that the study was a bit flawed from a traffic safety perspective in that it didn’t take into account crash severity. Sometimes, red light cameras do increase minor fender benders, but they still improve safety because they reduce the much more serious high-speed T-bone-style crashes.  People can pick and choose studies that support their biases, said David King, an urban planning professor at Arizona State University.  “The totality of camera studies suggest safety improvements,” he said.  A report from Greg Abbott’s office was based heavily on the Gallagher study, U.S. News and World Report reported. The other more numerous studies showing they worked were simply disregarded.  In the end, people don’t want to hear about studies that show red light cameras work.  “It’s terrible and horrifying,” said Crossley. “In street safety, there is no fun answer.”<end_of_turn>

# Emerging frontiers in phenological research

Emerging frontiers in phenological research  As climate change looms, we urgently need to understand how ecosystems will respond. Plant phenology, or the timing of developmental events like flowering, offers a powerful lens to make sense of the changes we are likely to see. Phenology is both driven by climate and deeply impacts ecosystem functioning. The timing of trees leafing out, blooming, and fruiting are key events in ecosystems, and even small perturbations in this timing can have drastic, cascading effects across an ecosystem. A recent special issue of Applications in Plant Sciences titled "Emerging Frontiers in Phenological Research" presents several studies on the forefront of phenological research. Traditional phenological studies involve highly trained botanists scoring plant phenological states for countless hours. A number of studies in this issue present tools for cutting down that laboriousness, allowing this research to scale up. As Dr. Elizabeth Ellwood, Research Fellow at La Brea Tar Pits and co-editor of this issue, explains, "Innovative tools presented here provide data users with improved methods for accessing, analyzing, and applying these datasets to timely research, including vegetation parameter estimates in climate models."  For example, the software package PhenoForecaster (Park et al., 2019) can predict flowering time of more than 2300 angiosperm species. "This lessens the need for years of fieldwork before analysis and enables other researchers, such as climate modelers, to readily work with phenology data," notes Dr. Ellwood. Similarly, imaging provided by PhenoCam (Richardson et al., 2019) can drastically reduce workload in phenological research by estimating phenology at the landscape scale.  Historical phenology data can provide insights into past climates that are otherwise difficult to reconstruct. As Dr. Ellwood explains, "Phenology, like weather, is quite variable, making it imperative to have long-term datasets to be able to discover patterns of change. Other data sources, for example observational records or data from satellite images, are unable to provide extensive historical information."  "The role of herbaria is foundational to historical records of plant phenology," Dr. Ellwood goes on to note. "Each herbarium specimen is unique and is direct evidence that a species existed at a certain place and time, and was collected in a certain vegetative and reproductive state. When taken together, herbarium specimens provide an unparalleled source of baseline, historical data." However, scoring phenological data from herbarium specimens is costly in terms of time and labor.  Fortunately, increasingly digitized herbaria collections (see Figure) make automated scoring practical, through the clever use of computer neural networks such as those introduced by Lorieul et al. (2019). These scores might be coarser than those created by manual scoring by trained botanists, but as Ellwood et al. (2019) show, for many applications and questions, the coarse phenological data produced by computer neural networks seem to produce only slightly weaker models than those produced with finer-scale, manually annotated data.  Similarly, as Pearson (2019) shows using simulated specimen data, finer-scale phenological data can be estimated from the kind of coarse scores produced by neural networks. "Modeling techniques, such as those employed by Pearson (2019), permitted the researcher to explore research questions through a methodology that was independent, though robust to, data on the physical specimens," explains Dr. Ellwood.  Another major obstacle to building large-scale phenological datasets is the difficulty of integrating scores from different sources. Phenology can be described in many ways, and phenological data from direct observation, landscape-scale imagery, and herbarium specimens can be difficult to aggregate and analyze due to these discrepancies. Fortunately, the Plant Phenology Ontology (PPO) provides a standardized, relational vocabulary to describe these phenological states. Brenskelle et al. (2019) updates this database to account for relationships between plants and the plant parts present in herbaria, making these data easier to integrate and paving the way for broad meta-analyses from multiple data sources.  Phenology closely tracks climate and also drives many ecological interactions, making phenological databases a crucial tool in understanding the ecology of climate change. The tools presented here offer computational approaches to allow phenology research to scale up. These big datasets are urgently needed to address the big questions of today. As Ellwood and colleagues note in this issue's introduction, "At landscape scale, even small changes in phenology can have substantial consequences."<end_of_turn>

# Dad who put 88 drug wraps in his mouth died after bags got stuck in his airway

A young father died after after a plastic bag full of drugs got stuck in his airway while police pinned him face down on the floor.  Edir Frederico Da Costa, 25, died almost a week he was stopped by officers in June 2017, having stuffed around 88 wraps of class A drugs in his mouth.  Jurors concluded after an inquest lasting almost five weeks that the death caused by ‘misadventure’ after his upper airway became obstructed and led to cardiorespiratory arrest.  The 11-member panel were advised by senior coroner Nadia Persaud there was no legal or factual basis for a conclusion which was critical of the police.  The death led to riots on the streets of London following claims he had been ‘brutally beaten’ by police.  But an Independent Police Complaints Commission report said there were no injuries suggesting severe force had been used.  Mr Da Costa died six days after the car he was travelling in with Jussara Gomes and Claude Greenaway was pulled over by five plain-clothed police officers in Beckton, east London. Man, 42, dies and boy, 13, fighting for life after horror crash in Manchester The car trader – who had a number of convictions for burglary, theft, and possession of cocaine – was being restrained in the prone position when around 20 to 30 wraps were spotted on the ground near his mouth, the jury said.  The deceased – known to family and friends as Edson – became unresponsive, was placed in the recovery position and paramedics removed a plastic bag containing wraps of drugs from his airway.  He died in Newham University Hospital on June 21 after a period in intensive care.  Mr Da Costa, who was born in Portugal but moved with his family to London aged five, had placed 88 wraps of class A drugs in his mouth at some point before or after getting out of the car, the jury said.  They acknowledged the ambulance service had initially been given the wrong address by police but said the delay had not contributed to his death. Lidl security guard filmed punching and stamping on shopper Mr Da Costa’s father Ginario Da Costa said it had been difficult to listen to some of the evidence at the inquest.  Following the jury’s findings, he said in a statement: ‘To hear the detail of the last moments of Edir’s life has been an extremely traumatic experience for the whole family and is something we will never be able to erase from our minds.’  He said questions remain for the family over the circumstances of his son’s death.  He added: ‘We cannot help but wonder whether Edir would still be here had the police identified the risk of Edir choking earlier and taken steps to help him.  ‘Edir did not deserve to die in the way that he did and we will forever feel that if things had been done differently his life may have been saved.’  Susie Labinjoh, head of civil liberties at Hodge & Allen, the law firm representing the family, said the inquest revealed a ‘series of concerns’ about how police treat people suspected of putting drugs in their mouths.  She said: ‘Officers should be taught not to assume that a person is resisting arrest when there is a risk that they are struggling because their breathing has been restricted.’  Ms Labinjoh suggested more police training on choking risks was needed and said there are ‘serious issues’ around correct information being passed from the police control room to the ambulance service.<end_of_turn>

# When Will ‘Letterkenny’ Season 7 Be On Hulu?

If you’re in the mood for some drinking, fighting, and top-notch comedy, the Canadian sitcom Letterkenny is for you!  Created by and starring Jared Keeso, the deceptively clever sitcom centers on the day-to-day dustups between the residents (the hicks, skids, and hockey players) of the small Ontario town of Letterkenny. The cult comedy separates itself from similar shows thanks to a blazingly distinct, idiosyncratic tone. Despite rapid-fire dialogue that rivals Happy Endings in terms of jokes per minute, scenes amble about at a relaxed pace, perfectly content to extract humor from crisp conversational comedy instead of relying heavily on an overstuffed plot.  Fans who’ve devoured the first six seasons of this series have one question: When will Letterkenny Season 7 arrive on Hulu?  Here’s everything you need to know!  IS LETTERKENNY ON HULU?  IS LETTERKENNY ON NETFLIX?  Figure it out! Sorry. Kidding. Nope. Letterkenny isn’t streaming on Netflix.  WHEN WILL LETTERKENNY SEASON 7 ARRIVE ON HULU? WHEN IS THE LETTERKENNY SEASON 7 RELEASE DATE?  Earlier today, Hulu announced that Letterkenny would not only return for a seventh season, but it would be returning as a Hulu Original. The six-episode seventh season of Letterkenny will be available exclusively to Hulu beginning Monday, October 14, 2019.  WHAT WILL LETTERKENNY SEASON 7 BE ABOUT?  The Hulu press release noted that the upcoming season will focus on the Hicks starting an “agricultural call-in show.” That’s a Texas sized 10-4.<end_of_turn>

# Madonna Said That Her Recent New York Times Profile Made Her Feel “Raped”

Madonna Said That Her Recent New York Times Profile Made Her Feel “Raped”  “To say that I was disappointed in the article would be an understatement.”  Madonna isn't happy with the way her latest interview turned out.  "To say that I was disappointed in the article would be an understatement," she wrote. "The journalist who wrote this article spent days and hours and months with me and was invited into a world which many people dont get to see, but chose to focus on trivial and superficial matters such as the ethnicity of my stand in or the fabric of my curtains and never ending comments about my age which would never have been mentioned had I been a MAN!"  She went on to imply that the writer, Vanessa Grigoriadis, had a hard time being "the champions of other women."  "Im sorry i spent 5 minutes with her," she wrote. "It makes me feel raped. And yes I’m allowed to use that analogy having been raped at the age of 19."  She first opened up about being raped at 19 in an interview with Howard Stern in 2015, telling the talk show host that a stranger sexually assaulted her.  In the profile, Madonna had discussed everything from Harvey Weinstein (who she said "crossed lines and boundaries and was incredibly sexually flirtatious and forward" with her) to Donald Trump (she denied rumors that she had asked him for a date).  "When we talked about aging, I was surprised when she turned the issue back on me," Grigoriadis had written. "I felt a little foolish for thinking that she would want to talk to me about my own concern about aging, like an older sister. She was an icon, not a shoulder to lean on."  In the interview itself, Madonna addressed the topic of aging, telling Grigoriadis, “I think you think about growing old too much. I think you think about age too much. I think you should just stop thinking about it. Stop thinking, just live your life and don’t be influenced by society trying to make you feel some type of way about your age or what it is you’re supposed to be doing.”<end_of_turn>

# Cleanup finally coming to old farmers market site in Columbus thanks to EPA grant

City wants to clean up the old farmers market site. Here’s how you can have a say in its future use.  Columbus Consolidated Government has received a $500,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to clean up the contaminated former State Farmers Market site.  The EPA announced the grant funding in a news release Wednesday. State, city and federal officials gathered Thursday to celebrate the news. Columbus was one of five Georgia communities to receive the funding.  “This project is the first step in turning an underutilized property into a productive use and will have a huge impact on the revitalization efforts in Columbus,” wrote Mayor Skip Henderson on Facebook.  The 14.67-acre site on 10th Avenue was developed in the mid-1950s as the Georgia State Farmers Market. There are 10 dilapidated buildings including a restaurant, offices, warehouses, covered loading areas and a vehicle maintenance building. There are also two underground storage tanks on the site.  The site was locked up in 2017, according to previous Ledger-Enquirer reports.  The site is contaminated with inorganic materials, metals and petroleum compounds, according to the EPA. Previous Ledger reports say fuel leaked into the ground. Other pollutants include asbestos and lead paint.  Of the $500,000, approximately $209,250 will be used to clean up hazardous substances, and $290,750 will be used to clean up petroleum, according to the EPA. Cleanup grants require a 20% cost share which could be in the form of money, labor, material or services — meaning the city will provide $100,000 in funding of some sort.  Columbus received the funding from the EPA’s Brownfield Program. A brownfield is a property where the presence of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants hinders expansion, redevelopment and/or reuse, according to the EPA.<end_of_turn>

# Airplane part falls out of sky, hits Las Vegas apartment building

June 7 (UPI) -- Federal aviation and local law enforcement officials said they're investigating what appears to be a door or panel from an aircraft that fell out of the sky and onto an apartment building in Las Vegas.  The incident happened Thursday near Nellis Air Force Base, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The object struck an apartment building and a vehicle. The Metropolitan Police Department said no one was injured.  Investigators determined the part came off an aircraft immediately after it took off from the air base. Police Lt. Bill Steinmetz told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the piece was "non-sensitive in nature," meaning it wasn't from military equipment.  FAA officials said they weren't sure what kind of aircraft the part came from.  Residents of the complex said the object made a loud noise when it hit.  Anthony Pitts told KTNV-TV that he heard a "smack."  "And when it hit it was loud," he said. "And the first thing I did was run in the house. I'm not going to lie. I was scared. I thought it was a shooting. That's how loud it was."  Another resident, Alex Lopez, said he thought the world was ending.  "One of my kids could have been walking out here and that thing would have hit him," he said. "It's not going to be a concussion. Not going to be 'Oh no, I'm hurt, honey, go to the hospital.' They would be dead."<end_of_turn>

# Texas couple who mysteriously died in Fiji texted family that they’d been ‘throwing up for 8 hours’

The Texas couple had been planning a vacation to Fiji - relaxing on the palm tree-lined beaches, maybe snorkeling with manta rays or hiking in Koroyanitu National Heritage Park. Excursions like this one had become tradition. The couple, who had posted previous vacation photos from Cabo San Lucas and Hawaii, tried to travel together about once a year, one family member told ABC affiliate WFAA. Late last month, David and Michelle Paul, from Fort Worth, boarded the family dog and said what they thought were temporary goodbyes to their 2-year-old son and David’s daughter from a previous relationship. Then they hopped a plane bound for a South Pacific adventure, according to the station.  Soon after the couple arrived in Fiji on May 22, they became gravely ill. And despite medical treatment, their symptoms continued to worsen. A Facebook user appearing to be David’s mother wrote this week that the couple had both contracted a virus and, days later, both had died. “David has gone on to Heaven,” said the Facebook post. “We are so thankful the Lord has provided him eternal life thru Jesus Christ his Saviour. David is smiling in Heaven, I am sure. His and Michelle’s smiles would light up any room and I am sure you who knew him, knew that Love you all. We will cry, but we are alright.” A U.S. Department of State official confirmed the deaths of Michelle and David Paul in Fiji and offered condolences to the couple’s families. But the circumstances surrounding their vacation and the mysterious ailment that turned their trip to tragedy remain mostly a mystery. Where did they go? What did they do? And perhaps most importantly - what disease could the couple have been exposed to? Early on, Michelle texted her parents, telling them that she and her husband had fallen ill. “We are both going to doctor now,” the 35-year-old wrote in a series of text messages later obtained by ABC News. “We have been throwing up for 8 hours. Dave has diarrhea. My hands are numb. We wil text when we can.”  After returning from the clinic, she wrote: “They gave us fluids and anti-nausea drip. They gave us electrolyte packets and anti-nausea pills.” "We still don't feel 100 percent," she added, according to ABC News. "Going to rest in our room." Michelle died May 25. Two days later, her 37-year-old husband was dead too, according to ABC News. After their death, Fiji's Ministry of Health and Medical Services said in a seemingly unrelated statement that it has been monitoring communicable diseases, including influenza and other things. Then Thursday, after announcing that a couple vacationing in Fiji had become ill and died, the ministry said in a statement that influenza had been “ruled out” and “at this stage we do not believe there is any risk to the public.” The case is under investigation, it said. The ministry said a "small number" of health-care professionals who had come into close contact with the couple are being monitored for symptoms, but are currently "well." The Ministry of Health and Medical Services said that it is also working with the U.S. Embassy in the country, as well as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization, to help determine how the couple died. WHO said it is "providing access to laboratory and other technical services in Australia."  Marc Calanog, Michelle's father, told People magazine that he and his wife are caring for the couple's 2-year-old son and that he worries about the day that they will have to tell the toddler how his parents died. In the meantime, Calanog said, they are trying to hide their indescribable grief from the child. "If we get depressed, then my grandson will be the one to suffer," he told the magazine. "Right now, we are taking care of my grandson. We want to be strong because instead of being a grandparent, we might end up being a parent and that is a big shift from what we've been doing for the last few years." "Overall, we will recover," he added. As for the couple’s dog, Tracey Calanog, Michelle’s sister-in-law, told WFAA she called numerous kennels near the couple’s home in Fort Worth and, with some help from the community, she was able to find their dog, Zooey, and take the animal home with her. -- Lindsey Bever of The Washington Post wrote this story.<end_of_turn>

# Defending champ Medway bows out early at OFSAA rugby

The Medway Cowboys rarely ride home this early from the OFSAA boys AAA rugby championships.  The Medway Cowboys rarely ride home this early from the OFSAA boys AAA rugby championships. The top seed and defending gold medalists fell 16-12 to No. 8 Kingston Regiopolis-Notre Dame in the second round Friday afternoon in Ajax, ruining their bid to become the first back-to-back victors in 35 years. Medway led 7-6 at halftime, but penalties played a major factor in stifling their offensive push. “There were so many of them throughout the game,” Cowboys coach Ryan Kimmerly said. “We would have momentum and then get called for something and they would kick us back in our own end – or kick for posts. We were on the doorstep a number of times, but a penalty would be called on us, they would clear their end and we’d basically have to march our way back again.” The Kingston school took advantage of the infractions with a strong kicking game to pull ahead down the stretch. It forced Medway to constantly chase the clock and, ultimately, to suffer its first defeat in more than a year. “Normally, we’re one of the six teams who play four games (in the tournament),” Kimmerly said. “That’s the part of the risk of sport and we came out on the wrong side. “We try to have it that we’re always reloading, not rebuilding. We have a lot of guys we have faith in and we’re poised to continue (with a strong team) again next year.” ON THE TRACK: In early Day 2 action at Guelph, South’s Kate Plumb captured the junior girls high jump with a 1.60-metre effort. She made three of her last four heights on the second attempt. Erika Graham of Clinton St. Anne was third at 1.55. Oakridge’s Lisa Caruso finished second and Mother Teresa’s Daniela Beckett was third in midget girls pole vault. Both were good at 3.00m, but Beckett had two more misses. Mother Teresa grad Alysha Newman holds the meet record at 3.26m from 10 years ago. Lucas senior Chloe Knox recorded a bronze in the senior girls triple jump with an 11.90m distance on her fifth of six tries. Parkside’s AJ Stanat picked up his second medal in Guelph, finishing third in the junior boys shot put (16.50m).<end_of_turn>

# PM Modi first foreign leader to visit Sri Lanka after Easter bombings, to express solidarity on visit

PM Modi first foreign leader to visit Sri Lanka after Easter bombings, to express solidarity on visit  Prime Minister Modi is visiting the country with a very clear message of solidarity and signalling confidence in the Sri Lankan government in overcoming the tragedy. Updated: Jun 07, 2019 17:36 IST Colombo Prime Minister Narendra Modi will briefly visit Sri Lanka on Sunday during which he will hold discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena, according to the president’s office here. Modi will be the first foreign leader to visit the island nation after the Easter bombings that killed over 250 people, including 11 Indians. This will be Modi’s third visit to Sri Lanka. Earlier, he visited the country in 2015 and 2017. “The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to arrive in Colombo on Sunday for a visit limited to a few hours. The re-elected Indian leader will be on transit from the Maldives,” president Sirisena’s office said. The Indian Prime Minister who will arrive at 11 am is to attend an official luncheon hosted by the Sri Lankan President Sirisena and hold bilateral talks. Sri Lankan police said they have made elaborate security arrangements for the visit, including traffic movement restrictions during the day. In New Delhi, the External Affairs Ministry said that Prime Minister Modi is visiting the country with a very clear message of solidarity and signalling our confidence in the Sri Lankan government in overcoming the tragedy. Asked whether India will help Sri Lanka deal with the scourge of terrorism, the ministry said on Thursday it was ready for any assistance to any country of the region. Sri Lanka was hit by a wave of bombings on April 21. The attacks came despite prior intelligence warnings from India.

# Whiny researchers slam dodgeball as a tool of ‘oppression’

These researchers were clearly last picks.  Forget famine, war and disease, the real tool of oppression, at least according to three Canadian researchers, is dodgeball.  “The message is that it’s okay to hurt or dehumanize the ‘other,’ ” researcher Joy Butler, a professor who studies pedagogy and curriculum development at the University of British Columbia, recently told the Washington Post.  The team’s findings, set to be presented at the Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences this week in Vancouver, argue that the playground favorite actually “reinforces the five faces of oppression” — which have been classified as exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism and violence by political theorist Iris Marion Young.  Young probably didn’t have Alix Piorun, 33, in mind when she sought to sketch out the faces of oppression. The soft-spoken 33-year-old nuclear medicine technologist has been playing dodgeball in recreational leagues for the past ten years, and even served as a referee for the Dodgeball World Cup this past July.   ‘I’ve always been a good athlete, so I guess you could say I’ve been on the oppressor side.’ “I’ve always been a good athlete, so I guess you could say I’ve been on the oppressor side,” Piorun, who has placed in national competitions for her dodging, catching and throwing skills, tells The Post.  Piorun contends that the team sport actually gives kids who might not be fast and strong a chance to shine. “Kids who aren’t always the best athletes are sometimes the best catchers…there’s always going to be people bigger and stronger than you, but you have to figure out a way to outsmart them — whether it’s dodging or catching.”  And with 55 member nations in the World Dodgeball Federation (or what the researchers might call the Axis of Recess), it’s safe to say that not all ballers are bullies. The key, says Piorun, “is throwing to your opponent’s ability. If you’re trying to hit someone who’s really good, you can throw harder. If someone’s not as great, maybe slow it down.”  Butler is encouraging physical-education teachers to replace the gym staple with “outdoor education, fitness, gymnastics, aquatics.”  For her part, Piorun plans to stick with her band of dodgeball demons: “The league I’m in is a big community,” she says. “People keep coming back season after season — from people who are good to people who are crappy. It’s just so much fun.”<end_of_turn>

# Cowboys v Sea Eagles: Jordan McLean's NSW hopes in tatters after hamstring injury

Having used all eight interchanges, North Queensland were forced to play with 12 men for the final 13 minutes of a 22-20 loss to Manly when prop Jordan McLean hobbled from the field with a hamstring injury.  McLean immediately clutched at his left leg after Sea Eagles hooker Manase Fainu lifted then dumped him awkwardly to complete a three-man tackle at 1300SMILES Stadium on Saturday night. Unable to continue, McLean went into the sheds and the Cowboys had to soldier on a man short while chasing a winning try. North Queensland coach Paul Green had exhausted his final two interchanges only minutes earlier, replacing the injured Mitch Dunn with Coen Hess and swapping debutant hooker Reuben Cotter for Jake Granville. Not only did the bizarre situation diminish the Cowboys' chance to win the match at the death, but it may have cost McLean a NSW Origin berth. The front-rower was among the leading candidates to cover for David Klemmer (fractured wrist) in the second clash against Queensland on June 23.  According to the NRL Physio, McLean is looking at two weeks on the sidelines, a recovery period that would rule him out of Blues contention.  Jordan McLean off with stretch strain of left hamstring/adductors. Stretch strains often require longer recovery time than usual. Even the most minor of strains can require at least 2-3 weeks to return to play #NRLCowboysManly pic.twitter.com/QH5IMsdEj9 - NRL PHYSIO (@nrlphysio) June 8, 2019 McLean has had an unhappy run with injury since joining North Queensland from Melbourne in 2018, with a foot issue keeping him out for four months last season.<end_of_turn>

# Man trapped in burning car saved by officer using bystander's tow strap in Palatine

PALATINE (Sun-Times Media Wire) - A police officer, with the help of a bystander’s tow strap, saved a man trapped in a burning car that had crashed into a building in northwest suburban Palatine. A 48-year-old man drove his Kia Soul into the brick wall of an abandoned building shortly before noon Friday in the 600 block of East Dundee Road, Palatine police said in a statement. The car caught fire and the man was trapped inside, police said. Officers arrived to the scene and tried to reach him but couldn’t because the burning car was stuck in the building. A citizen provided a tow strap, which the officer used to pull out the Kia with his squad car, police said. The man was pulled from the car and taken by paramedics to Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge with burn injuries, police said. Police were investigating the cause of the crash.

# Roland Garros: Ashleigh Barty Beats Marketa Vondrousova to Win French Open Women's Singles Title

Roland Garros: Ashleigh Barty Beats Marketa Vondrousova to Win French Open Women's Singles Title  Ashleigh Barty defeated Marketa Vondrousova in straight sets to Australia's 46-year wait for a French Open singles title  Ashleigh Barty won her maiden Grand Slam title (Photo Credit: Reuters)  Paris: Ashleigh Barty ended Australia's 46-year wait for a French Open singles title on Saturday by thrashing nervous Czech teenager Marketa Vondrousova in a one-sided women's final. Eighth seed Barty got off to a strong start and never looked back, winning 6-1, 6-3 after only 70 minutes to claim her maiden Grand Slam title.  The 23-year-old will rise to second in the world behind only Naomi Osaka when the latest rankings are released next week, after becoming the first Australian winner at Roland Garros since Margaret Court won the last of her five trophies in 1973. She will be best-ranked Australian woman since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1976. "It's unbelievable, I'm a little bit speechless. I played the perfect match today. I'm so proud of myself and my team, it's been a incredible two weeks," said Barty. "It's a special place for Australians here. Sam (Stosur) has done well here before and come so close. It's been a magical two weeks." Barty, who famously took a break from tennis to play professional cricket in 2015, struck 27 winners past an opponent riddled with nerves. The 19-year-old Vondrousova saw her bid to become the first teenage Grand Slam champion since Maria Sharapova won the 2006 US Open come to a tame end, as the world number 38 made 22 unforced errors, against a mere 10 winners.  NERVOUS WAIT Almost 90 minutes after the match was due to start, the players made their way onto Court Philippe Chatrier, after Dominic Thiem's thrilling five-set win over Novak Djokovic in the men's semi-finals forced Barty and Vondrousova to endure a nervous wait. The scheduling had already been criticised on Friday as a sexism row erupted when the women's semis were moved away from the showpiece Chatrier court. In fact, this was the first match on the premier Roland Garros arena in Vondrousova's career, although she did have a brief practice session on Saturday morning. The tension got the better of the Czech early on, as she double faulted to gift Barty two break points, before firing long to put her opponent 2-0 ahead. Barty, who also reached the Australian Open quarter-finals earlier this year, consolidated the break with a confident love hold, leaving Vondrousova firmly on the back foot after only seven minutes of play. Another break followed as Vondrousova threatened to fall apart, but she settled down and got herself on the scoreboard. Barty quickly got back on track, and wrapped up the first set after only 29 minutes with a crunching forehand winner. Vondrousova had it all to do in the second set having managed just two winners in the opener, but she contrived to drop serve again at the first time of asking. She finally held serve for the first time in the match, though, saving two break points in the third game. Vondrousova had reached the final without dropping a set and had the best record on tour since the Australian Open, but she left it too late to get her game in order on this occasion. And Barty broke once more, hammering away a simple smash on her first match point to seal her moment in the spotlight, with Vondrousova left sitting on the bench in tears.

# Lions coach Matt Patricia drawn to NASCAR by engineering background

BROOKLYN, MI – Matt Patricia wanted to be an engineer before he became a NFL coach. While his career trajectory has changed since earning an aeronautical engineering degree at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, he still thinks like an engineer. Which is why he calls himself a “huge NASCAR fan.” Patricia is serving as the grand marshal for the FireKeepers Casino 400 Cup Series race at Michigan International Speedway this weekend.  “The aerodynamics, horsepower and engineering stuff that goes into the cars, I just find fascinating,” Patricia said. Patricia and his family arrived to the track Sunday morning and met with driver Aric Almirola and his family. Almirola visited a Detroit Lions practice earlier this spring, was given a helmet and fielded a few punts. Being able to meet with drivers and get inches away from their cars – just hours before the race starts – is another reason Patricia loves the sport, he said. "In my world, on game day, you're not getting close to the players or coaches, we're in the locker room all by ourselves. I just think the access is amazing," Patricia said. "That NASCAR opens up the doors to allow the fans to have that kind of up-close personal contact on race day, is pretty amazing." He hasn't been offered a ride along in a race car yet, but Patricia said he'd definitely do it. But honorary pace car driver and Detroit Red Wings legend Darren McCarty wasn’t signing himself up for a spin. "I don't want to go fast – let's get it right," McCarty said. "Pace car speed is perfect for me." The two Detroit sports figures posed for photos after talking in the media center at MIS on Sunday.  McCarty wasn’t a NASCAR fan earlier in his life, saying it was “just drivers making left turns.” He’s since gotten into the sport through a buddy, and now finds parallels to hockey and roots on rival drivers Kyle Busch and Brad Keselowski.  Like Patricia, McCarty said he’s “blown away” with the access fans have just hours before drivers compete at 200 mph. And you don’t have to have an engineering background to appreciate it, he said. “I’m one of those guys not like Matt, no engineering degree,” McCarty said. “I know where the gas tank is, and that’s about it.”<end_of_turn>

# Duchess Kate wore McQueen to Trooping the Colour, brought all three kids

The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William attended Trooping the Colour with all three children, as expected. The Cambridge kids didn’t get to ride in the carriage with their mom (Kate did the carriage-ride with Meghan, Camilla and Harry), nor did they get to ride on horseback, which is what William did for the event. I think Nanny Maria basically had to corral them at the palace and then the kids got to go on the balcony with mom and dad. This was Prince Louis’s first-ever time at Trooping the Colour – he’s about 13 months old, so it feels pretty young, but he was very well-behaved. I didn’t see any crying or tantrums, and he even waved at the planes as they flew overhead.  As for Kate, she wore a new suit by Alexander McQueen, although I thought this could have been a repeat because it looks pretty similar to several other McQueen suits she owns. This one was a pale yellow, and it featured an “interesting” coat, with a structured V-neck and a peplum. She did repeat the Philip Treacy hat though – she’s worn that hat several times before, including the Sussexes’ wedding last year. Also notable: she wore a pair of Bahrein pearl-and-diamond-drop earrings. Pretty. And she wore a large (for her) diamond crucifix.  Remember how Kate likes to throw in visible callbacks to Princess Diana? Well, she dressed up Prince Louis in the same outfit Prince Harry wore to Trooping the Colour when he was just a baby/toddler. I have a question about those throwbacks – are there, like, official baby-clothes archives somewhere in the Royal Collection and Kate has permission to take Harry and William’s baby clothes whenever she wants? I’m really asking.  Photos courtesy of WENN, Backgrid, Avalon Red.<end_of_turn>

# Tehran gastronomy festival to focus on healthy food

Tehran gastronomy festival to focus on healthy food  TEHRAN – Tehran will be hosting a gastronomy festival on June 15, which aims to bring healthy food and diet into sharp focus. The festival intends to pursue a perspective of shaping a healthy and vibrant society through improving food industry [standards] and encouraging the use of healthy food intakes, CHTN reported.  The event will be organized by the Ministry of Health under the auspices of the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization.  Experts say that food is not merely an organic product with biochemical compositions. However, for members of each community, food is defined as a cultural element.  The Iranian cuisine, usually dominated with fragrant herbs, varies from region to region. It principally accentuates freshness, deliciousness, and colorfulness.  AFM/MQ/MG<end_of_turn>

# Philadelphia Union completes three-goal comeback to top New York Red Bulls

The Philadelphia Union, down 2-0 at halftime, decided to play like the top team in the Eastern Conference. When the final whistle had blown, they extended their lead atop the table with a furious comeback led by Ilsinho’s brace, providing both the equalizing and winning goals to set Talen Energy Stadium alight.  Kaku and Brian White struck in the first half to put the Red Bulls in front, with Philadelphia’s defense asleep at the wheel and the attack sputtering mightily aside from Sergio Santos’s shot off the crossbar early on. Even goalkeeper Andre Blake was to blame as he hesitated to allow White in for the Red Bulls’ second.  After halftime, the Union strike force went into overdrive as the home side finished the match with 17 shots, including seven on target. On the hour mark Jamiro Montiero pulled one back for the hosts on a goal that was nearly identical to Kaku’s opener, assisted by substitute Ilsinho, a foreshadow of things to come.  Philadelphia’s second was all Ilsinho just a minute later, cutting in from the right flank and skipping straight between two Red Bulls defenders before unleashing a knuckler with the outside of his foot. That brought Philadelphia back level with two goals in two minutes, and it wouldn’t be long before the hosts were in front.  11 minutes later, Ilsinho again cut in from the right with an identical weaving run, and this time he fed a cutting Bedoya who flared towards the end line. The U.S. international looked to chip a cross into the danger area, and a sliding Sean Nealis left his trailing arm in the air which the ball found. Ilsinho was on hand to bury the spot-kick and give Philly the lead with 18 minutes remaining.  The win left the Union four points in front of the pack in the Eastern Conference with 31 points from 17 games, while New York sat in fifth with 24 points out of 16 matches.<end_of_turn>

# WATCH: J’den Cox talks about shutting out Bo Nickal, the “most dangerous guy in the country” at Final X Rutgers

J’den Cox probably doesn’t get the respect he deserves. He’s beaten Kyle Dake, David Taylor and now Bo Nickal to make U.S. world teams and is also a defending world champion and Olympic gold medalist. On Saturday night, Cox swept past Nickal in a highly-anticipated freestyle matchup at Final X Rutgers to capture the U.S.'s 92 kg spot on the world team that will compete in Kazahkstan in September.  “I love proving people right,” said Cox. "But I really love proving people wrong. I don’t write names down any more because that’s just time-consuming. That also shows you how many people talk trash on me. “But I remember a few names, what they said, some things stick, some don’t. But I don’t let them bring me down. And then the excuses come out when you prove them wrong.”  Cox felt he had something to prove against Nickal, who just finished off a stellar career at Penn State in which he won three NCAA titles. Nickal also dominated at the World Team Trials and the matchup against Cox was viewed as one of the marquee showdowns. The first match was was close with Cox slipping past 4-2, but Cox dominated the second bout, 5-0, to claim his fourth consecutive world team spot. Watch Cox talk about how important it was to shut down a wrestler he referred to as “the most dangerous guy in the country” and ranting about how U.S. wrestling fans need to come behind the members of the world team, no matter who they are.<end_of_turn>

# Analysis: No budget woes? La. lawmakers created other feuds

Freed from the budget problems of prior years, Louisiana lawmakers found other things to bicker about in their just-ended session: abortion, sports betting, and even cauliflower rice and soy milk.  But after years of angry battles over taxes and spending, even the most heated feuds of the 60-day session that ended Thursday seemed pretty low-key by comparison.  One of the most contentious fights involved whether to legalize sports betting, an effort pushed for two years by term-limited Sen. Danny Martiny, a Kenner Republican who had this one last session to try to win support.  House lawmakers stalled the proposal. Martiny fumed at the microphone about how he was treated by House members. And in retaliation, he helped sink a separate fantasy sports regulation and taxation package sought by the House.  A new abortion ban passed by lawmakers and signed by Gov. John Bel Edwards, which won't take effect unless a federal court upholds a similar Mississippi law, drew more rancorous debates than anti-abortion measures in years past. A handful of Democrats strongly objected to their colleagues' refusal to include exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest in the ban on abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy.  Sen. J.P. Morrell, a New Orleans Democrat, grew angry on the final day of session when it became clear his bid to exempt feminine hygiene products and diapers from sales taxes would fail to win final passage. He cited the abortion ban, the Legislature's refusal to ratify an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and the failure of equal pay and minimum wage proposals.  "Yet again, the Legislature fails women," Morrell said.  Senators argued over whether to let medical marijuana patients use an inhaler, like asthma patients use, finally agreeing to pass it in the final week.  Prompting irritation from a number of lawmakers in the waning days of session were proposals targeting cauliflower rice, almond milk and non-meat burgers. The legislation aims to keep veggie products from being marketed as milk, rice and meat.  Ultimately, the House and Senate agreed to the food labeling restrictions that Edwards said he intended to sign into law. But passage only came after loud debate and mocking over the protectionist measures for farmers. Rep. Raymond Crews, a Bossier Parish Republican, called the legislation "silliness really."  A last-minute feud also erupted between lawmakers who wanted to enact a minimum marriage age in Louisiana and conservative House members who fought the idea, arguing it could delegitimize children born to teenagers. A bill setting the minimum age to marry at 16 passed in the session's last hour.  Despite the tamer nature of the session, one trend that didn't fail to repeat itself was timing. Lawmakers procrastinated on reaching deals, and the session ended as it nearly always does, in a frenzy of last-minute bill passages that seemed entirely unnecessary to go down to the wire.  After a decade of worry about looming or immediate budget gaps, a seven-year tax deal passed last year left lawmakers with a more pleasant difficulty. They had to decide where to spend new dollars for next year and a surplus left over from last year.  As usual, the House and Senate managed to be at odds over that task. Behind-the-scenes negotiations on the $30 billion state operating budget, a multibillion-dollar state construction budget and a package of companion budget bills continued until nearly Thursday's 6 p.m. mandatory adjournment.  Meanwhile, lawmakers sat around, taking photos, signing session keepsakes, and giving farewell speeches.  A chaotic passing of the spending plans came in the last half-hour before lawmakers had to wrap up with little explanation of what the final negotiated deal contained.  At one point, Senate President John Alario grew frustrated that the House, which had control of the bills, hadn't sent over the final documents for passage.  "We should have had this two or three hours ago," the Westwego Republican lamented. "It's too important to the people of this state."  Still, Republicans and Democrats largely applauded the final budget plan, which pumps new dollars into public colleges, K-12 teacher pay raises, early learning programs, senior centers, foster care, and services for the disabled.  ___  EDITOR'S NOTE: Melinda Deslatte has covered Louisiana politics for The Associated Press since 2000.

# Most children who use food banks will go hungry this summer in London

Over two thirds of children in poverty in the capital will go hungry during the school summer holidays unless charities provide free food and activities, new research has found.  The same number say they are afraid of being targeted by gangs and over half report a high risk of being sexually exploited because their parents have no choice but to leave them at home alone.  Child poverty campaigners said the research showed how school summer holidays offer a ‘bleak outlook’ for growing numbers of children in London.  The Childhood Trust warned that cuts to youth services and charity grants – which disproportionately affect low income families – mean more than half a million children in the city will go hungry this summer.  Child activists from one of the capital’s poorest boroughs have today launched a manifesto calling on the government to end summer holiday hunger and provide free activities to make sure vulnerable children are safe when they’re not at school.  Pupils from Peckham, who earlier this year made a film to show what it is really like to use a food bank, have been sharing their harrowing experiences of being beaten up, bullied and too scared to go outside during the summer holidays.  Aged just 9, one of the children involved revealed how she had been targeted and assaulted by gang members.  She said: ‘Every time I’d come outside they’d punch me and hurt me and tease me.  ‘I still have the scars on my knees from where they hurt me.’  The Trust, which today launches its Summer Give campaign, said half of children in poverty under the age of 11 will be left without adult supervision because of the price of holiday clubs.  The Summer Holiday Manifesto  Children should never go hungry during the holidays (or at any other time) Children should never be left on their own all day if their parent(s) have to work All children should have a holiday club to go to where there are free, fun activities and hot meals All children should feel that they can play outside without threat or intimidation from gangs or other children The police should be able to keep children safe during the holidays Local MPs should volunteer at their local holiday club so children know who their MP is and can tell them what needs to change The Government should fund Local Authorities to universally provide these things for all children   On average it costs £121 a week to send a child to a holiday club – more than £700 for the duration of the summer holidays.  ‘Local councils have cut youth services by 44 per cent on average since 2011 and there are not enough places for children to attend,’ the Childhood Trust said.  ‘Whilst the government recognises the impact of poverty on children during the summer holidays it has failed to address this with just £9.1million of funding allocated to support 50,000 children in 11 areas of England.  ‘Councils in London have suffered the largest cuts to annual youth services budgets with Westminster’s funding per child slashed by more than half, from £1,591 to £761.62.’  Sorry, this video isn't available yet. The Trust’s chief executive Laurence Guinness said: ‘It’s heart breaking to see seven, eight and nine year olds appealing to the government to provide proper funding for children who are going hungry and are terrified during the holidays.  ‘Cutting youth services is a false economy and is contributing to increased crime, youth violence and child exploitation.’  Since 2013, the Trust has raised £11.3 million in match funding campaigns for over 150 projects ‘to provide a lifeline for London’s poorest kids’, Laurence said.

Autosread more Britain's economy contracted sharply in April after the biggest fall in car production since records began, as manufacturers were unable to reverse closures planned for when they had expected Britain to leave the EU. Early in 2019 many motor manufacturers had announced temporary shutdowns in Britain for April, in anticipation of trade disruption around the time Britain was due to leave the European Union on March 29. In the event, Prime Minister Theresa May delayed departure with just days to go and subsequently set a new date of Oct. 31 -- but this was too late for businesses to change their plans. Britain's economy overall contracted by 0.4% in April after a 0.1% decline in March, the Office for National Statistics said on Monday, a bigger drop than any economist had forecast in a Reuters poll last week. Growth in the three months to April slowed to 0.3% from 0.5% in the first quarter of 2019, also a sharper deceleration than most economists had expected, while the annual growth rate fell to 1.3%. But this masked a far bigger impact for the manufacturing sector, which shrank by 3.9% on the month in April, the biggest fall since June 2002. Car production in April fell 24% on the month, the biggest drop since records began in 1995, and the broader category of 'transport equipment' showed its largest drop since 1974. "GDP growth showed some weakening across the latest three months with the economy shrinking in the month of April, mainly due to a dramatic fall in car production, with uncertainty ahead of the UK's original EU departure date leading to planned shutdowns," ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said. Monday's data confirm that the economy is slowing after receiving a bigger-than-expected boost in the first three months of 2019 from businesses stockpiling ahead of a Brexit that never came. The Bank of England forecast last month that GDP growth would slow to 0.2% during the three months to June from 0.5% in the first-quarter of the year, though on Saturday its chief economist Andy Haldane wrote that he still expected "solid" growth of 1.5% for 2019 overall. Britain's economy has lost momentum since 2016's Brexit referendum - before which growth would typically exceed 2% a year - but the job market has strengthened and Haldane said the time for another rate rise was approaching. This stance contrasts with the view in markets, where concerns about the impact of trade conflict between the United States and China have intensified, alongside the risk that Britain could face a disruptive departure from the EU on Oct. 31. May's purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys pointed to the economy being close to stagnation, although they were similarly gloomy in the first quarter when official data turned out strong, despite businesses' concerns about Brexit.<end_of_turn>

# Devon Energy announces plan to further cut methane emissions at production locations

Devon Energy announces plan to further cut methane emissions at production locations  Devon Energy Corp. announced Monday it plans to further cut methane emissions from its U.S. oil and natural gas production operations.  In a news release, company officials stated they plan to lower detectable emissions at production sites by at least 12.5% in six years.  The company measures methane emissions by calculating a methane intensity rate that represents a percentage of natural gas it produces. For 2018, its methane intensity rate was an estimated .32% (subject to third-party verification and a review by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency).  Devon officials said they plan to reduce that methane intensity rate to .28% or less by 2025, stressing the company is embarking on that plan voluntarily to meet one of its core values of being a good environmental steward by managing climate risk.  “By continuing to operate responsibly and increasing our focus on leak detection and repair, we’re confident we can meet this ambitious target,” Devon CEO Dave Hager stated in the release.  On Monday, officials said Devon’s process is comprehensive and transparent because it tracks emissions across all its operated assets, even those where reporting isn’t required by the EPA.  Devon stated it finds methane emissions problems using an infrared camera-based leak detection and repair process designed to help the company establish best management practices and to identify technology, equipment and materials to better control methane emissions.  The company also stated that employee and top-level executive compensation levels will be tied to meeting Monday's announced goal, supplementing already existing short-term emissions performance requirements.  Methane emissions concern environmentalists.  An organization called Earthworks, for example, visited Oklahoma earlier this year to use an infrared camera to evaluate methane emissions from production pads in the state’s STACK play in Kingfisher County.  On Monday, Earthworks Policy Director Lauren Pagel agreed methane emissions from the oil and gas industry must be reduced to address climate change.  "Unfortunately, voluntary commitments like Devon's have a poor track record at best," Pagel said. "Instead, industry leaders should support strong national safeguards that will raise the bar for all operators and be enforceable by state agencies that are accountable to the public."  Sierra Club officials hold a similar point of view.  Johnson Bridgwater, director of Oklahoma Sierra Club, said Monday he was pleased to hear about Devon’s plan, but added, “continuing to extract fossil fuels — including natural gas — is not how to address the climate crisis.”  Bridgwater said satellite measurements show the actual percentage of natural gas leaking into the atmosphere is much higher than companies routinely estimate.  “If Devon is serious about reducing harmful emissions, they will greatly increase their monitoring of methane leaks from their drilling, completion, fracking, flaring, and midstream activities and will only do business with companies that do the same."  Devon, meanwhile, states on its website it has voluntarily participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project for 15 years, publishing an annual report on what it does to control and reduce emissions.  The report tracks the company’s greenhouse gas emissions at locations under its control that involve fuel combustion, flaring, fugitive emissions, venting and storage losses and electricity consumption.  As for Monday’s announced methane emissions reduction target, “the actions we’re taking reaffirm our commitment to responsible production operations, going beyond what is required by law in pursuit of continuous improvement in environmental performance,” Hager stated.<end_of_turn>

# U.S. Open: 3 more players get exemptions and 3 alternates make field for Pebble Beach

Andrew Putnam, Emiliano Grillo and Scott Piercy have earned full exemptions into the 119th U.S. Open, the USGA announced Monday morning.  Putnam got into the 156-player field by virtue of being No. 50 in the OWGR. He was second in the Sony Open in Hawaii this season. Putnam, whose lone PGA Tour victory came at the 2018 Barracuda Championship, is playing in his second U.S. Open.  Grillo is No. 56 in the OWGR and tied for second at the CIMB Classic in October. In his last start, Grillo tied for ninth at the Memorial.  Piercy, who is No. 59 in the OWGR, tied for second at the 2016 U.S. Open at Oakmont behind champion Dustin Johnson. This season Piercy tied for second at the Byron Nelson. He missed the cut at the RBC Canadian Open.  Three alternates also made the field: Joel Dahmen, Bernd Wiesberger and Harris English. Dahmen was the first alternate from the Columbus, Ohio, sectional and is playing in his first U.S. Open. He was second to Max Homa at the Wells Fargo in May.  Wiesberger was the first alternate from the England sectional and comes to the Open after winning the Made in Denmark event on May 26.  English was the first alternate from the sectional in Canada. He has two PGA Tour wins in his career, the last coming in 2014, and finished T-20 at the RBC over the weekend.<end_of_turn>

# House panel to vote Wednesday on whether two Trump officials are in contempt of Congress

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee plans to vote on Wednesday on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for stonewalling a probe into an alleged scheme to politicize the 2020 U.S. Census. “Both Secretary Ross and Attorney General Barr are refusing to comply with duly authorized subpoenas from Congress,” the committee’s chairman, Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, said on Monday in a statement announcing the vote. “Because they are in contempt of Congress, on Wednesday, the Committee will vote to move forward to enforce our bipartisan subpoenas,” he said. In a statement, Ross called the planned vote an “empty stunt” and said he had cooperated with the committee, providing 14,000 pages of documents and testifying for nearly seven hours. If the committee finds them in contempt, a vote could then take place in the full, Democratic-led House. If the full House votes in favor of contempt, it could take Ross and Barr to court to seek compliance. The committee is investigating a plan by President Donald Trump’s administration to add a question on citizenship to next year’s U.S. Census questionnaire. Critics believe including the question will scare immigrants and Latinos into abstaining from the survey, which is taken every 10 years. That could disproportionately undercount Democratic-leaning states, they argue. Ross has said the citizenship question would help enforce the Voting Rights Act, which requires a tally of citizens of voting age to protect minorities against discrimination. The panel’s Democrats said they scheduled the contempt vote after both Ross and Barr did not produce documents about the issue in response to a bipartisan subpoena the panel issued more than two months ago. The committee said Ross testified that he added the citizenship question “solely” at the request of the Justice Department. The panel said documents showed, however, that Ross “began a secret campaign” to add the question to the census questionnaire shortly after taking office and months before being asked to do so by the Justice Department. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the committee’s move to schedule a contempt vote.

# 9 Ways To Party And Still Feel Fresh The Morning After | MTV UK

9 Ways To Party And Still Feel Fresh The Morning After  Your ultimate guide to hangover avoidance…  So you’ve tried taking supplements before drinking, and all the energy drinks on the planet the morning after, but you still can’t seem to avoid an all-day hangover? Well, we’re here to help, with some back-to-basics tips to help you party all summer – without the repercussions the next day.  1. Stay hydrated  You’ve heard it before, you’ll hear it again, but are you really paying attention to everyone telling you to drink more water? Make sure you’re sufficiently hydrated before you head out, chase every alcoholic beverage with some water and then DRINK. MORE. WATER. before you go to sleep. You’ll wake up glowing instead of green.  2. Line your stomach  We know a liquid dinner is tempting, especially when you’re rushing to get ready after work, but you’ll regret it when your mate’s putting you in a taxi home before midnight. That only works for Cinderella. Foods rich in protein, carbs and fat will slooooow your body’s absorption of alcohol. If your stomach is full, and you keep your drinking to a minimum, you’ll be partying all night long.  3. Take a disco nap  Drinking alcohol when you’re already exhausted is a recipe for disaster, usually involving tears and a stream of embarrassing DMs to the ex you swore you’d never contact again. Even a 10 to 20-minute nap before you head out will give your body and brain some zen time, and hopefully keep you smiling until the end of the night, therefore removing any hungover fear the next day. Hurrah.  4. Think of your bank balance  Before you get involved in buying rounds or buy another drink you really don’t need, consider the impact on your finances. Won’t you be happier if you wake up hangover-free with some extra cash in your bank account to spend on brunch the next day? Yes, yes you will.  5. Consider an alcohol-free night out  Whether you go dancing and sip on a virgin mojito, or organise an alternative night out with your mates where you’ll be distracted and drink less, it’s good to have two or more consecutive days without any alcohol. Your body will thank you later.  6. Stick with your mates  It’s always good to stick with the group and look out for each other, because not only do you want to avoid a hangover, but also any accidents, lost phones or general risky situations. Stay with the pack and make sure you all have safe transport home.  7. Dance your pants off  Nothing distracts you from drinking too much quite like a killer DJ, so make the most of the music and get dancing. If you really want to have a drink in your hand, this would be a great time to grab that water bottle – which conveniently doubles up as a microphone.  8. Set yourself a drinks curfew  Planning on staying out until two? Cut yourself off from the bar a little earlier, unless it’s for soft drinks, and you’ll feel so much better the next day. Remember, it takes about an hour for the body to process each unit of alcohol, so the earlier you stop drinking the more time you have to rejuvenate before the morning.  9. Make plans for the next day – just not too early  If you know you have something to look forward to the next day, chances are you won’t overdo it – but leave yourself ample lie-in time, just in case. There’s nothing worse than a 7am alarm when you only went to bed at 3am (even if you did stop drinking at midnight!)  Make it a night to remember.

# It's something we got to address each day: John Cena on WWE retirement plan

Washington D.C. [USA], June 11 (ANI): American WWE wrestler John Cena, who has been the World Champion 16 times, has finally admitted to his thoughts of wrapping up his wrestling career. "I think an individual's career is up to the individual, I think that's pretty much the way I can describe that," TMZ quoted Cena as saying. "I'm only 42 but it's something we've got to address each day. It's individually specific - when those people are ready to stop they'll stop," Cena added on his retirement plans. However, Cena also asserted that he is healthy and fine, his wrapping up of the wrestling career isn't due to any injury. "Man, I always feel good," Cena added. Cena's  last major encounter was in April 2018 when he lost against The Undertaker in an impromptu match which lasted just 2 minutes and 45 seconds. The wrestler isn't expected to quit immediately and would likely stay associated with the WWE universe in one way or the other. For fans already worrying about missing Cena, the wrestler is stepping into the movie business alongside Vin Diesel in the 'Fast and Furious 9'. He added, "I'm very grateful to Vin Diesel for certainly orchestrating it all and making it happen." In an interview given to Environmental Weekly earlier, Cena said, "I'm surrounded by a group of people who are better than I am and such skilled people with so much experience, so what a great environment to learn from. I give everybody who is attached to the franchise and who enjoys the franchise the promise that you will get my absolute best." Cena's role is kept under tight wrap for now. No details about the storyline have been shared as of yet. The film is scheduled to hit the theatres on May 22, 2020.

# ANC thanks MPs for service after resignations

ANC thanks MPs for service after resignations  On Monday, the party confirmed that it’s now in the process of reviewing its list to the National Assembly and will soon announce who will take over from the former ministers.  JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament has thanked former ministers Jeff Radebe and Dr Siyabinga Cwele for their service, saying while they are leaving the legislature, they won’t be lost to the party. Jeff Radebe resigns from parliament after 25 years as an MP  The two became the latest former members of the executive to resign from Parliament. Their departure follows those of former ministers Thokozila Xasa, Susan Shabangu, Dipuo Letsatsi Duba and Nomaindia Mfeketo. The reasons behind Radebe and Cwele’s resignations are still not known but it’s believed just like other former ministers, they want to secure their pensions at the level of a minister instead of an ordinary member of Parliament. On Monday, the party confirmed it was in the process of reviewing its list to the National Assembly and would soon announce who would take over from the former ministers. The party expects to fill seats left by the two anytime from later this week.  The party said the latest of its former ministers to resign had indicated they were willing to serve the party in other capacities. “Their departure does leave a void within the caucus. But the caucus is quite satisfied by the knowledge that we will be able to tap into their experience over time as they’ve both indicated that they’re willing to serve the party in other capacities,” ANC Parliament’s spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli said. Meanwhile, Bathabile Dlamini resigned from Parliament with immediate effect on Tuesday morning. In a written letter to ANC secretary- general Ace Magashule, she said serving the party, as well as the ANC Women's League, was something many South Africans wished for.

# Gov. Whitmer makes several stops around Mid-Michigan Monday

FLINT (WJRT) -  (06/10/2019) - Governor Gretchen Whitmer made her rounds Monday in Mid-Michigan. And her first stop - in Flint. The day started at Genesee Packing Inc. addressing the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and its attempt to close the skills gap in the state.  "This visit here is focused on talent and trying to ensure that people have opportunities to up skill to get higher wage jobs in Michigan," said Whitmer.  She spoke on the Going Pro campaign and its attempt to lower skilled-labor shortage.  "I think the going pro effort has been really important to businesses in Michigan,” said Whitmer. “I think we've seen great examples of that right here and this is a phenomenal investment that they made."  Other stops of the governor’s day were to Saginaw for the Promise Luncheon, a visit to Global Dow Center in Midland, and a tour of the crumbling US-10 Bridge in Bay County.  "This is something that we are focused on - closing the skills gap, fixing the roads, cleaning up water and making sure that our children have an education that prepares them for a successful prosperous life in this state,” said Whitmer.  Whitmer also spoke about where they are at in a plan to fix the road.  "We're in the midst of the budget deliberations and I'm working really hard to continue building bridges literally and figuratively with the republicans leadership with the legislature,” said Whitmer.  She said it remains one of the primary focuses in the state.  "It's undeniable we've got an infrastructure crisis across the state of Michigan,” said Whitmer. “Every one of us are paying for roads that are crumbling, we're paying in forms of new rims and windshields when our roads continue to get worse and worse and more dangerous and that's what we're trying to fix here."  Whitmer closed out the day attending the Tri-County roundtable at Saginaw Valley State University to talk about her Fiscal Year 2020 budget for the roads, education, closing the skills gap as well as cleaning up Michigan's drinking water.<end_of_turn>

# Trustee Moves to Remove School Nameplate Honouring a Father of Apartheid | The Tyee

Cecil Rhodes’s days of lording over L’École Bilingue Elementary School in Vancouver may soon be over. Vancouver School Board trustee Jennifer Reddy announced this week that she’ll introduce a motion to remove the Cecil Rhodes nameplate and all other references to the founder of Rhodesia from the school’s property “immediately.” 🙋🏾‍♀️My Motion for the next Board Meeting: It is recommended that the VSB immediately remove the Cecil Rhodes sign from the primary playground area of L’Ecole Bilingue... @VSB39 @OneCityVan @BuiltJustice @pattibacchus @TheTyee @CarrieBercic pic.twitter.com/NTQdh1hAJE— JenniferReddy (@reddyforchange) June 10, 2019 The motion will be discussed by the school board’s facilities and planning committee on June 19, and school board trustees will vote on the resolution at their monthly meeting on June 24. From 1910 to 1977, what is now known as L’École Bilingue was called Cecil Rhodes School. Four years ago, a monument in his name was moved from the foot of a school entrance to the school’s basketball court. Rhodes, a British citizen born in 1853, was a fervent believer in the importance of expanding the British Empire, a project he undertook with gusto in southern Africa. He founded Rhodesia (which today makes up parts of Zimbabwe and Zambia), exploited African people for cheap labour and land and, according to members of the anti-Rhodes movement at Oxford, “facilitated the deaths of hundreds of thousands of black South Africans.” Reddy, a member of OneCity Vancouver, learned about the nameplate after a recent Tyee article enlivened discussions about the nameplate amongst members of the L’École Bilingue parent advisory committee. The article recounted Rhodes’s legacy as a fervent colonialist and father of apartheid in South Africa. It reported that Natalie Morissette, the school principal, and Allan Wong, chair of the VSB facilities and planning committee, were taking a hands-off approach to the issue, putting the responsibility for action on the school’s PAC. Gwen Floyd, a member and former chair of L’École Bilingue’s PAC, said “in the last few years there was a lot of talk about the sign by parents.” At the group’s June 2018 meeting, a motion to ask “the VSB to remove or alter (in consultation with the L’École Bilingue community) the Cecil Rhodes sign from the primary playground area” passed by majority. But no real change happened. “Unfortunately, like everyone else, we can get caught up in other things and the motion we put forth last June went a bit by the wayside this year,” said Floyd. “We are very happy that Jennifer Reddy is taking it on, and we support the motion to get rid of the sign as soon as possible.” After hearing from parents and community members, Reddy has taken matters into her own hands. Reddy argues that removing the Rhodes nameplate is necessary if the VSB wants to uphold its “commitment to acknowledge and address anti-black racism” and other forms of bigotry. In OneCity’s media release about the motion, Stephanie Allen, director of the Hogan’s Alley Society, argued the removal of Rhodes’s name from the school is even more critical in the midst of ongoing anti-black racism within the school district. “Black children and their families are repeatedly bringing forward the exclusion and discrimination they feel in the VSB,” said Allen. “It’s past due that schools provide an equitable environment for black students to see themselves positively reflected and that the truth about the violent colonial history of Europe is truthfully told.” Some members of the school board, including Lois Chan-Pedley, the trustee for L’École Bilingue, advocated for a different response to the nameplate and the controversy it has created. In response to Reddy’s announcement, Chan-Pedley tweeted, “I’m worried about erasure and pretending our mistakes didn’t happen. Hope we can find another way that may appear less ‘honouring’ to colonial history.” Looking forward to hearing the greater context about this. I'm worried about erasure and pretending our mistakes didn't happen. Hope we can find another way that may appear less "honouring" to colonial history.— Lois Chan-Pedley 陳尚文 (@fishtron) June 10, 2019 “Honouring Cecil Rhodes was a mistake,” added Chan-Pedley. “The way to ‘fix’ it isn’t by sweeping our colonial bullshit under the rug. We should be addressing it: ‘this is a thing we did. It was a bad idea. Here’s what we are doing instead.’” The Tyee tried to interview Chan-Pedley but did not hear back by publication time. Chan-Pedley’s comments sparked a lively conversation on Twitter, with former VSB trustees Carrie Bercic and Patti Bacchus chiming in with counterarguments. What we shouldn't do is intentionally place a monument to a racist on a playground of a public school. In fact, we should be having a conversation about changing many of our school names altogether. I literally can't believe we are having this conversation.— Carrie Bercic (@CarrieBercic) June 10, 2019 Lois, the point that you seem to miss is how offensive and ignorant it was that @VSB3 staff made a deliberate decision to install this in 2017 — do you not see how wrong that was? Really? And that the response is “neutrality”?— Patti Bacchus (@pattibacchus) June 10, 2019 Bacchus, who served as chair of the VSB from 2008 to 2014, was “shocked” to learn that the nameplate had been preserved and is “appalled at the response” from the board. “When parents raised the concern, the response that they got was that ‘we’re neutral,’” added Bacchus. “That’s an absolute failure of leadership.” In response to Chan-Pedley’s concerns that removing the nameplate would constitute a dangerous erasure of our past mistakes, Bacchus said, “There’s absolutely no justification for me for having Cecil Rhodes’s name on a plaque on a basketball court with absolutely no context provided.” Reddy agrees. She hopes that the nameplate will be gone as early as the end of this school year, but knows that facilities staff are busy. Read more: Rights + Justice, Education, Media<end_of_turn>

# Zelenskyi asks parliament to dismiss chief prosecutor Lutsenko

"A motion has been signed to dismiss Prosecutor General Lutsenko," Riaboshapka said at a news briefing near the presidential administration's building in Kyiv on Tuesday.  The motion is about to be handed over to parliament, he said.  Riaboshapka explained the initiation of the Prosecutor General's dismissal as follows: "There is a legal position that is connected with the fact that despite changes in the law on the prosecutor’s office that the prosecutor general should not have a degree in law, other provisions of the law on the prosecutor's office say that only be a person with a degree in law could work as a prosecutor at the Prosecutor General's Office."  Riaboshapka stressed that a prosecutor performs procedural functions, respectively, he or she must have both a degree in law and relevant experience in the field of law.<end_of_turn>

# Rowing World Cup: Olympic champion Will Satch in GB squad

Rowing World Cup: Olympic champion Will Satch in GB squad  Olympic champion Will Satch and silver medallist Polly Swann have returned to the Great Britain squad for the World Cup in Poznan from 21-23 June. Satch, 30, who won gold in the men's eight at Rio 2016, has not competed since rupturing a tendon in his shoulder in December 2018. He will row in the second men's four boat in Poland. "It's been a long six months but just to get there is a big step for me," said the London 2012 bronze medallist. "If I can get among the field I'll be very happy." Swann, 31, returns to international competition for the first time since winning silver in the women's eight at Rio 2016, after taking time off following the Olympics to finish her medical degree. "I'm a little bit nervous because this is my first international race since 2016," said Swann, who is competing in the women's four. "I really didn't think I'd be doing much racing this year. I thought I'd be lucky if I got to go to one of the World Cups as a spare and support the team, so I do feel very lucky that I'm racing." European champion Ollie Cook, Matt Rossiter, Rory Gibbs and Sholto Carnegie will be in the first men's four boat. The men's eight of Tom Ford, James Rudkin, Tom George, Mohamed Sbihi, Jacob Dawson, Ollie Wynne-Griffith, Mat Tarrant, Josh Bugajski and cox Henry Fieldman and the men's quad of Jack Beaumont, Jonny Walton, Angus Groom and Pete Lambert are both unchanged after winning silver and bronze respectively at the European Championships earlier this month. Ruth Siddorn and Georgina Brayshaw will make their senior debuts as they compete in the women's double. The GB Para-rowing squad is also competing at after winning six medals in their season opener at the Gavirate International Regatta in May. "Our priority this year remains qualifying as many boats as possible for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, so this World Cup is another opportunity for us to assess where we're at and test ourselves against the rest of the world," said British Rowing director of performance Brendan Purcell.

# Evers vetoes loom as work on budget wraps up - Wisconsin Radio Network

As work on the state budget wraps up, talk of vetoes looms large. “I think you’re obviously going to see partial vetoes for sure,” Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz said on Monday. “The extent of those remains be seen. But I think we’re a long way off from what was proposed from the governor.  Republicans on the legislature’s Joint Finance Committee have spent weeks taking a scalpel — some would say a cleaver — to the budget proposed by Democratic Governor Tony Evers, who has the ability to make partial vetoes. The governor also could veto the entire JFC spending plan, if he so chooses.  “He’s not going to get everything he wants, we’re not going to get everything we want,” said Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke. “He’s going to make some partial vetoes. If he chose to veto the entire budget, I’m telling you he’d be making a huge mistake.” Steinke said vetoing the entire budget would leave municipalities and school districts unable to plan for their own budgets. He and Hintz were guests on WHBY’s “Fresh Take” program on Monday morning.  Speaking with reporters following an event in Madison on Tuesday, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said if Evers vetoes entire state budget, the Legislature will not come back to take up a veto override until October. By state statute, if a biennial budget is not signed by the start of fiscal year on July 1, spending levels set in the previous two year budget remain in place.  The Joint Committee on Finance is scheduled to complete its work on the budget on Thursday.<end_of_turn>

# American Medical Association Rebukes Medicare for All | Breitbart

The American Medical Association (AMA) rejected a resolution Tuesday that would have ended their opposition to Medicare for All and backed the single-payer healthcare proposal.  The AMA, which backed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) when Democrats originally drafted the law, defeated a proposal to back Medicare for All, with 53 percent against the proposal and 47 percent in favor of the measure.  The AMA said that they continue to back an expansion of Obamacare and will study a “public option,” through which Americans could either buy government health insurance plans or private health insurance.  Bob Doherty, the senior vice president of government affairs at the American College of Physicians, said that the AMA delegates “are clearly divided, nearly down the middle,” on whether to back Medicare for All.  The AMA has more than 200,000 members and serves as a powerful lobbying group in Congress and also belongs to the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, an organization that lobbies against government health care that is also comprised of health insurers, hospitals, and drug companies.  Over the weekend, 40 leftist activists interrupted the AMA conference by staging a “die in” to have the group back Medicare for All and leave the Partnership.  Approximately 25 percent of the practicing physicians admitted that Obamacare is “not broken, but it is imperfect.”  The AMA instead recommended in a press release that the federal government should provide coverage to the roughly 30 million Americans who do not have health insurance, instead of “upending the health insurance coverage of most Americans.”  The AMA said they back an increase in ACA subsidies for Americans who not currently have health insurance as well as an increase in the amount that the government would pay towards Americans’ out-of-pocket medical expenses if they enrolled in Obamacare plans.

# Magpies and other birdbrains

By R. Gary Raham  The western black-billed magpie, Pica hudsonia, with his tuxedo-like black and white coloring, long tail, and extrovert’s belligerence, quickly impressed me when I first moved to Colorado from the Midwest. Like people, magpies (and other members of the crow family) will eat nearly anything, hang out together in intimidating mobs, and use their intelligence to take advantage of any opportunity. Author Boria Sax once said, “Crows often give an impression of sublime indifference to people, as though waiting patiently for the era of human beings to pass.”  Perhaps magpies, and birds in general, now considered being the last shrunken remnants of the dinosaur clan, are waiting for this whole “mammal fad” of the last 65 million years to pass. They may figure a critter doesn’t need hair, breasts, and inflated brains to take advantage of the planet’s bounty. Magpies use social skills and versatility to keep one step ahead of adversity.  For one thing, magpies aren’t picky about what they eat. They spent the ice ages eating ticks and beetles off the backside of giant bison and other megafauna. They will eat small mammals and other birds, along with their eggs and hatchlings. They will also devour fruits, nuts, and various grains as they come into season. Magpies will follow coyotes around to share what table scraps they can find and deftly dart in and out of traffic to sample road kill. They will even hang around eagles and other potential predators in groups of two or three and play successful games of “pester and steal.” One magpie will divert a predator’s attention long enough for another to snatch a choice morsel of food. Magpies and other corvids will also act collectively to “mob” raptors and other predators, to lessen the chances of becoming some other critter’s meal. Black-billed magpies tend to stick with the same mate for one or more years. They build 48” high X 40” wide complex dome-shaped nests that can take up to 40 days to construct. They will nest in open woodlands, thickets near a river, in fields, trees, shrubs, or even deserted buildings. Females usually tend to the interior, lining the cup-shaped nest chamber with grass and mud, while males embellish the roof with a canopy of sticks. When a pair finishes their efforts they mate and the female produces 6 to 9 eggs. The male stands guard to make sure his paramour doesn’t dally with a neighbor.  A Cornell website (http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/black-billed_magpie/lifehistory) notes what has been called “funeral behavior” in magpies. When one magpie finds the remains of a comrade, he or she will begin calling loudly, sometimes attracting up to forty other magpies. The birds remain around the corpse for 10 to 15 minutes, commiserating with loud chatter, before silently flying off to other duties.  Magpie bravado includes a swaggering strut and a stretch display in males that includes waving their bills in the air and flashing white eyelids. Aggressive birds may flick or quiver their wings to display intimidating white wing patches. During courtship, magpies may spread their long tails enticingly. Females looking for companionship often beg for food.  Magpies and other blackbirds rank high on various intelligence tests. New Caledonian crows named Abel and Betty proved adept at using and fashioning hooks out of wire to raise a basket of food within a tube so they could reach the meal. Bernd Heinrich, a long-time student of Ravens, has demonstrated the birds’ ability to both use tools and recognize individual humans and what to expect of them during future encounters. Alex Kacelnik, who worked with the New Caledonian Crows, ranks them second to chimpanzees in their ability to use tools.  In 2008, some British magpies passed another test that so far had only been passed by apes, elephants, and dolphins: the ability to recognize themselves reflected in a mirror. Such self-recognition is considered a hallmark of intelligence and magpies manage the feat with a brain the size of a pea.  That magpie sizing you up took a very different path to the park bench. While humans and chimps are only separated by some 250,000 generations, we last shared a common ancestor with the magpie some 170,000,000 generations ago.  Arthur Savage, author of an entertaining book called Bird Brains, sums things up nicely: “Perhaps all birds are smarter than we are used to thinking. In the end, being called a bird brain may be a compliment.”<end_of_turn>

# FIRST RAISE A FLAG: How South Sudan Won the Longest War But Lost the Peace - Geographical

On 9 July 2011, amid raucous celebrations, Africa’s largest country split in two and the nation of South Sudan was born, bringing to an end a brutal civil war that claimed millions of lives. But the surge of optimism that greeted the creation of Africa’s first new nation in almost 20 years masked a grim underlying reality.  As soon as it was created, South Sudan shot to the bottom of the global development rankings. Decades of war had destroyed much of the country’s meagre infrastructure; only one per cent of the population had access to a reliable electricity supply; water sources were polluted with toxins; the country’s entire road network could be travelled in less than an hour. The government was of little help as it quickly became mired in corruption.  But most ominously, that optimism also hid a cauldron of simmering ethnic tensions; South Sudan is home to about 70 ethnic groups, dominated by the Dinka who make up 30 per cent of the population. And, on 15 December 2013, those tensions erupted into a brutal civil war that has since claimed millions of lives.  ‘The khawaja [foreigners] are always writing, it is what they do. We need someone to write all this down, so that what has happened is not forgotten.’ So says Joseph Bading, an elderly teacher living in a UN base with 125,000 other South Sudanese civilians, to author and journalist Peter Martell. Over the course of more than a decade that straddled independence day, Martell reported from Sudan and its southern offspring. He interviewed political and military leaders, Mossad spies, aid workers and the paternalistic foreign policy wonks brought in to help guide South Sudan along the path to nationhood. But he also spent a lot of time speaking to ‘ordinary’ people about the extraordinary brutality that they witnessed – he ‘gathered the stories of those who have not spoken of them before’.  Martell has placed those stories within a well-researched history that provides context, but it’s his first-person account that drives this compelling, harrowing story. His despair at the way that events have unfolded is palpable, as is his compassion for the civilians caught up in the tragedy and chaos of South Sudan’s birth and subsequent descent into conflict .

# Battery charges up Bay City Western in softball quarterfinal win over Lowell

MLive.com MOUNT PLEASANT, MI – Megan Mann knew there was a former all-American catcher watching her every call. But the Bay City Western catcher also knew that her coach, Kris Popp, was happier having her back than being on it. Mann and Western pitcher Adaline Ziehmer teamed to lead the Warriors to a 4-1 softball quarterfinal win Tuesday over Lowell at the same Central Michigan University field that Popp starred on when she was Chippewas catcher Kris Tipton. Photos from Lowell-Bay City Western softball quarterfinal “Megan called a great game, and Z (Western pitcher Adaline Ziehmer) trusts her,” Popp said. “Those two work together very well. She knows what’s working for Z. “One game in college, I was hurt and called pitches from the dugout. I hated it. I called pitches when I caught in high school and in college. I’ve always believed in a catcher calling the pitches. Z might shake off a pitch now and then, but Megan understands Z and what’s working.” Ziehmer, a junior, allowed just three hits and one run, striking out 13. “Ziehmer’s rise ball was crazy … it jumps out of nowhere,” Mann said. “It really takes off. I’m getting ready to catch, and sometimes it takes off on me. She has some other big pitches … her changeup got some strikeouts today … but the rise is her go-to pitch.”<end_of_turn>

# New Day make winning WWE return with victory over Owens, Zayn and Ziggler

Jefferson Lake  WWE Editor @jeffersonlake  New Day make winning WWE return with victory over Owens, Zayn and Ziggler  Last Updated: 12/06/19 8:12am  Big E was back on SmackDown to help The New Day to a hard-fought victory over Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn and Dolph Ziggler in a six-man tag-team match.  WWE champion Kofi Kingston looked to yet again vanquish the three superstars that have been coming for his head since he captured the title but this time had his New Day brothers by his side. In an intense main event, Ziggler accidentally nailed Zayn with a superkick, which allowed Kingston to strike with two Troubles in Paradise - one to The Showoff, which took him out of the contest, and then another to Zayn, which secured the victory for The New Day.  WWE Late Night Smackdown  June 12, 2019, 10:00pm  Live on  The victory proved The New Day do indeed still rock but Kingston still has his agenda full for the coming weeks, a not unheard-of scenario for a top-tier WWE champion. He will put his title on the line at Stomping Grounds, live on Sky Sports Box Office on June 23, against Ziggler in the confines of a steel cage.  Bayley sends message to Bliss Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross were the female players of the Raw wild card for this week's SmackDown, with the former providing corner support for the latter for a crack at SmackDown women's champion Bayley.  See WWE Stomping Grounds on Sky Sports Box Office!  Don't miss a minute of the action from WWE Stomping Grounds live on Sky Sports Box Office on June 23!  The contest was given something of an edge when the Goddess informed Bliss Bayley liked several disparaging tweets about her following their collision on Raw. With Cross seeking payback against Bliss' Stomping Grounds opponent, the former Sanity member was clearly fired up as she stepped to the champ but The Hugger managed to put Cross down with a massive elbow drop for the win, staring Bliss down as she made the cover to issue a major pre-pay-per-view statement.  Rough night for The Miz The Miz got the chance to get a piece of Shane McMahon by defeating Elias and Drew McIntyre in singles bouts. The A-Lister was undeterred by the mountain he was facing, and with Shane and McIntyre lurking at ringside, he took down Elias down with a Skull-Crushing Finale to get one step closer to colliding with Shane-O-Mac. But The Scottish Psychopath had other ideas and - with Shane in full distraction mode at ringside - leveled Miz with a ring-rattling Claymore Kick for the win.

Find out how  Despite Miz not being victorious, McMahon accepted the challenge of a match anyway, taking on the down and dazed A-Lister. The plan almost backfired though when Miz got to his feet and got in some offense but his exhaustion was too much to overcome, and he tapped out to a Triangle to trigger another excessive celebration.<end_of_turn>

# Lack of transparency in sugar divestment process – GAWU tells IMG Chief

The country’s biggest sugar union has expressed its concerns over the divestment process involving four sugar estates that have been separated from the Guyana Sugar Corporation (GuySuCo).  The concerns were raised on Monday when the Guyana Agricultural and General Workers’ Union (GAWU) met with a team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
The IMF team is currently visiting Guyana to undertake the fund’s annual Article IV consultation. 
The GAWU team which engaged the six-person team for over an hour, was led by its Assistant General Secretary, Aslim Singh, and included the Union’s Organising Officer, Porandatt Narine, and Executive Committee member, Gordon Thomas. 
According to GAWU, yesterday, the main focus of the discussion were the structural changes of the sugar industry. 
“The union, on this matter, expressed concern regarded what it termed the two pronged approach adopted by the Government of Guyana. The GAWU team explained that one prong concerned the divestment of three of the closed estates, namely Skeldon, Rose Hall and East Demerara Estates. 
“The other aspect regarded the re-capitalization of the estates under the control of the Guyana Sugar Corporation (GuySuCo).” 
With respect to the divestment approach, GAWU expressed concern that the process appeared to lack transparency. 
“We pointed out that the divestment would possibly be the largest in the nation’s history yet the Guyanese people were none the wiser about the value of the assets being put up for sale. 
“Moreover, we reminded the IMF that its 2017 Article IV report on Guyana had urged the Government to ensure that displaced sugar workers be protected by appropriate safety nets.” 
The union said it pointed out that this suggestion was not considered as apart from the statutory severance payments to workers, which “we reminded were illegally withheld and corrected following the intervention of the Courts… there is hardly, if any, tangible expression of the state’s assistance to the workers and communities affected. 
“We pointed out that since the estate closures, many affected remain hard pressed and find themselves in difficult and miserable situations. We shared that, in some instances, children’s schooling has been truncated and families have disintegrated. 
“Moreover, the opportunities for employment remain almost non-existent.” 
The three closed estates- Skeldon, Rose Hall and Enmore- are on the market now with a deal near. It involves the consortium of Indian, Ghanaian and local businesses. 
The government has hired PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to oversee the divestment and privatization process of the estates. 
Recently, PwC said that the process to value the estates and determine what exactly belonged to GuySuCo was a challenging one. 
GuySuCo in the last decade has been facing falling production and mounting debts. 
Its estates are badly in need of upgrading with agriculture suffering and workers migrating to greener pastures. 
With regards to GuySuCo’s plans to recapitalize the operable estates– Albion, Blairmont and Uitvlugt–GAWU reiterated its concerns about the apparent absence of a plan to guide the large sum secured. 
It will be recalled that last year, the state-owned National Industrial and Commercial Investments Limited (NICIL) secured a bond financing of up to $30B (US$150M) using a number of banks and insurance companies. 
However, GuySuCo and NICIL have been clashing over what the former said is a sloth in the release of the money which is supposed to be largely plugged into capital and long-term projects. 
“We shared that, on several occasions, we asked GuySuCo about its plan only to receive deafening silence. GAWU said that it recognized President David Granger just last week referring to a plan. 
“We noted that the President had said, according to media reports we saw, that the Corporation was not operating by guesswork or hunches. Nevertheless, we shared our apprehensions that despite what, we believe, are our good intentioned best efforts we remain shut out from being knowledgeable about the Corporation’s plans.” 
According to GAWU, during the engagement, the team also sought views about the happenings in other areas of the agricultural sector. 
“On that score, we expressed views regarding the rice, poultry and fishing industry. Of course, the oil and gas industry also attracted attention during our discussion as well. 
“On that matter, the GAWU shared its view that it appeared we were least prepared at this time to effectively deal with the industry and what it could bring to the proverbial table. 
“We also shared the view about the possibility of inequality between the oil and non-oil sectors of the economy and its ramifications for wider societal issues.” 
The IMF team, the union said, committed to examining the suggestions in finer detail. 
“The GAWU, for many years now, has been interacting with the IMF during its annual country visits. We have found those interactions as worthwhile and provide us yet another opportunity to represent our members and the workers of Guyana generally.”   Jun 12, 2019 With new sponsors KFC on board, the 2019 Senior National Squash Championships will serve off this evening at the Georgetown Club, Camp Street.

# Squaring The Circle Of Family and Career - A Coworking Space With Childcare in Germany

Peggy Wahrlich has a glowing smile and a calm attitude which radiates inner peace. It is hard to imagine that her business idea was basically fueled by anger. She brews a cappuccino before sitting down to talk business, attachment parenting and her story as a founder.  COWOKI, her coworking space with childcare, resides in a new building next to an old neo-Gothic church tower right in one of Cologne's hippest areas, "Belgisches Viertel" (Belgian quarter). Bright rooms, modern and stylish furniture, but yet arranged in an unagitated way. A lot of wood and steel, white walls and white desks, dotted with grey or rose chairs. Two vases with large bouquets of beautiful flowers in the kitchen. A high-end coffee machine. An indispensable utensil in a coworking space. Stylish, but down to earth, is the vibe you feel.    COWOKI offers 30 to 40 workplaces – and currently nine childcare places, which are completely booked out. No wonder in Cologne, the 4th biggest city in Germany, where the search for childcare often brings parents to the verge of despair, especially for children under the age of three. In Germany, the gap in childcare provision for this age group currently amounts to 300.000 missing places as a study by the German Economic Institute showed at the beginning of 2018. Especially in the former West of Germany, this gap is huge. While there – contrary to the former East – traditionally many children were looked after at home until they entered kindergarten with the age of three, the demand for early childcare now increases since a few years. Factors like a rising birthrate in Germany, immigration and the lack of qualified daycare workers add to the pressure. The result: a "crisis" in daycare provision.  For Peggy Wahrlich the lack of innovative childcare opportunities was the initial fuel for her idea. As a freelance decorator, she was relatively flexible. "But working from home with a child brings you to your limits. In 2002, my older daughter was two or three, I had the unspecific wish for a place where I could work and where I could take along my kid", recalls the mom of two girls, aged 17 and 10. At that time a corresponding initiative ("Zeiträume") existed in Cologne, but the fee of 600,- Euros per month seemed too expensive. 2010 Peggy was confronted with the same situation all over again. She was upset by the fact that "fathers just could continue to do their own thing" while the mothers often stay at home with their kids. "It is unacceptable that all these women stay at home, even when they often are highly educated and are stuck in provisional solutions". Like only working part-time for years due to the underdeveloped childcare system. It was great dissatisfaction with the existing childcare possibilities combined with the feeling "I need to do something for the women!" which gave Peggy the drive to start her own business. Doing some research, she quickly discovered "Rockzipfel" in Leipzig, which according to Peggy is seen as the "pioneer" in Germany regarding coworking spaces with childcare. Several offshoots were established in other German cities like Dresden, Hamburg, and Munich. For Peggy this felt like a confirmation of her idea: "I am not alone. There are other mums in the same situation – maybe this is indeed quite a good idea". She worked on a concept and a business plan and finally opened COWOKI in 2017.  Was it all going that smoothly? No, Peggy also mentions all the bumps in the road like regulations by the building control department of the city and another ton of regulations regarding the opening of the childcare. Was a lot of courage needed for the decision to open her own business? Peggy thinks about it. "Sure, it requires courage, but I was more driven by this anger. This gave me some naivety, which probably let me turn a blind eye to some stumbling blocks. But the interesting thing is: You can overcome all these difficulties and grow. I don't know if I would have dared to do it without this portion of naivety. I just had the conviction to do the right thing".  And this belief still drives her today. COWOKI reaches the breakeven – but the salary Peggy can pay out for herself and her co-manager Melanie von Gersdorff is not high. "We don't earn particularly much – it is all about the idealism we have for the idea. But to be clear: The wages should not stay as they are". And there is the prospect of increased revenue streams with the opening of a second childcare group in August this year. The coworking space will then offer eighteen childcare spots. Once the second group runs smoothly, Peggy considers the concept of COWOKI scalable. The founder may consider opening a second site in Cologne in the future. She is convinced that the demand exists.  This view is shared by Christian Cordes, board member of the German Coworking Federation. He traces the opening of coworking spaces with childcare in Germany to the overall difficult care situation. The combination, however, is still a niche product regarding coworking in Germany in general, explains Cordes. All in all, about 450 coworking spaces exist in Germany, but only about 10 of them promote explicitly the childcare they offer. The big coworking chains like WeWork or Design Offices generally speaking do not offer any childcare solutions according to the knowledge of Christian Cordes and Peggy Wahrlich (although WeWork runs a school in New York, starting for two-year-olds). It often is the personal story of the founders, which drives the opening of a coworking space with childcare, tells Cordes.  So as in Peggy's case. But she also sees a more general trend behind coworking with childcare in Germany. She comes up with several narratives which all belong together somehow in the end: Women who want to work and who demand new solutions. Men who want to spend much more time with their kids and don't want to be the sole breadwinner. And parents who currently are paying more and more attention to ideas of attachment parenting and are re-evaluating (probably like every generation of parents before them) what their children really need. And – maybe – all this might feel easier to combine when you can work. And you still have your kid close to you. Like in a co-working space with childcare.  Roles, social models and families' needs are changing. But answers are still missing, there is a lack of new solutions. Peggy's credo: We must create these missing offers and possibilities. And so she did, turning anger into a business model and changing career paths to become a female founder.<end_of_turn>

# The Latest: David Ortiz making 'progress' after shooting

The Latest: David Ortiz making 'progress' after shooting  SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) - The latest on the shooting of former Boston Red Sox star David Ortiz in the Dominican Republic (all times local):  1:30 p.m.  The wife of former Red Sox star David Ortiz says her husband is recuperating at a hospital in Boston after being shot at a bar in his native Dominican Republic.  Tiffany Ortiz said in a statement issued by the team on Wednesday that her husband was in the intensive care unit at Massachusetts General Hospital under the direction of trauma surgeon Dr. David King.  "Yesterday and this morning, David was able to sit up as well as take some steps. His condition is guarded and he will remain in the ICU for the coming days, but he is making good progress towards recovery," she said.  "My family and I again want to thank everyone for their endless love and well wishes, and still ask for privacy while David continues to heal."  Journalists surround the police vehicle carrying Eddy Vladimir Féliz Garcia who was taken into custody in connection with the shooting of former Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz, as he is taken to court in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Tuesday, June 11, 2019. His lawyer, Deivi Solano, said Féliz Garcia had no idea who he'd picked up and what was about to happen, and that he expected Féliz Garcia would be charged as an accomplice to an attempted murder. (AP Photo/Roberto Guzman)  ___  12:30 p.m.  Dominican prosecutors say witnesses and security camera footage show that the attempt to kill former Red Sox star David Ortiz was carried out by two men on a motorcycle and two other groups of people in cars, indicating a new level of sophistication in the attack.  The details were contained in a court document obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday.  Oliver Moisés Mirabal Acosta, who was captured Tuesday night in the town of Mao in the northern Dominican Republic, was driving a grey Hyundai Accent before mounting the bike driven by 25-year-old Eddy Vladimir Feliz García, the document said.  The document also said the two men were seen on security camera footage talking with other people in the Accent and another Hyundai in a nearby street before the shooting at 9:20 p.m. on Sunday.  Feliz García's lawyer says his client is an innocent motorcycle taxi driver who had no idea his passenger was going to commit a crime.  Ortiz is recovering from his wounds in intensive care in Boston. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.<end_of_turn>

# Is your DNA snitching on your family? Family DNA is changing how police solve cold cases like the ‘Geauga’s Child’

GEAUGA COUNTY, Ohio -- Geauga County law enforcement solved the 26-year investigation into the death of a baby boy who became known as “Geauga’s child” using controversial new DNA technology that rose to prominence following the 2018 arrest of California’s notorious Golden State killer. But what is this new technology, and how does it work? In the past, investigators used proprietary DNA databases to solve criminal cases. That process involved investigators collecting DNA from a crime scene, then determining if it matched DNA in their database to reveal the suspect’s identity, Colleen Fitzpatrick, a world-renown DNA genealogist, said.  If there was no DNA match in their database, investigators were out of luck. Recently, law enforcement turned its focus to GEDmatch.com, a relatively new, publicly sourced DNA database. It was created in 2011 by a DNA genealogy enthusiast who had no intention of designing a platform that law enforcement could exploit to solve dormant criminal cases like the “Geauga’s Child.” “It was sort of like a desert island where the genealogists could go play in the sand with their DNA,” Fitzpatrick, who helped solve the Golden State Killer case, said. Investigators made an arrest in the “Geauga child” case 26 years after a woman discovered the baby’s remains along a wooded rural road. The child’s mother, Gail Eastwood-Ritchey, was charged with aggravated murder and was accused of abandoning the baby in a bag in the woods. GEDmatch allows its 1.3 million users to upload text files of their DNA they can obtain through submitting blood or saliva to third-party genealogy websites such as Ancestry. The user DNA is matched with distant relatives who also uploaded their genetic information to the database.  To protect users’ privacy, genealogy websites such as 23andMe refuse to voluntarily give user data to law enforcement unless compelled by a court issued subpoena. GEDmatch, however, piqued the interest of investigators due to its lack of barriers, Fitzpatrick said. Investigators use the website to upload DNA obtained at a crime scene to find a perpetrator’s distant family members. Once a cousin is discovered, the data is used to construct a family tree to narrow down the list of possible suspects. GEDmatch displays users’ screen names and email addresses, which Investigators use to help determine people’s real-life identity, Fitzpatrick said. They also use Social media platforms such as Facebook to research suspects and flesh out the family tree. Geauga County investigators created a family tree of “Geagua’s child” that consisted of over 1400 people by using GEDmatch, birth records and obituaries in an effort to discover the child’s parents, Geauga County Detective Donald Seamon said. Once investigators discovered family members of the child, they requested that the relatives get a DNA test then upload the results to GEDmatch. DNA genealogy is often more effective than using law enforcement databases for solving dormant crimes because it involves analyzing hundreds of thousands of people’s DNA, rather than relying on the genetic information of a single person, Fitzpatrick said.  What’s valuable about GEDmatch, however, is also the primary source of its controversy. Critics of the DNA genealogy process for solving crimes argue that allowing law enforcement to access DNA databases is a violation of privacy that could constitute a Fourth Amendment infraction. If a single person uploads their DNA to GEDmatch, they effectively drag the entire family’s DNA out into the public sphere, because relatives share both DNA and a family tree, Fitzpatrick said. It’s similar to uploading a family photo to Facebook, she said. There may be a family member in the image who doesn’t want the picture to be publicly shared—but it’s out of their control. “We’re not alone. We’re all connected genetically,” Fitzpatrick said. A 2018 study conducted after the discovery of the Golden State killer found that 91 percent of respondents believe law enforcement should use genealogical websites that match DNA to relatives to solve violent crimes and identify missing persons.<end_of_turn>

# Foreigners residing over 6 months must subscribe to state health insurance from July | Yonhap News Agency

SEOUL, June 13 (Yonhap) -- All foreigners who stay in South Korea for six months or longer will be required to sign up for the country's health insurance program to prevent them from receiving medical treatment and leaving without paying insurance fees, the operator of the state medical insurance scheme said Thursday. Under the new rules that take effect July 16, all foreigners, including Korean expatriates residing in the country, should pay over 110,000 won (US$93) per month, according to the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). At present, foreigners who work here are required to pay for health insurance, and non-working foreign residents here can optionally subscribe to the scheme. The NHIS said foreign students and those marrying South Korean nationals are also required to join the state insurance scheme. The new mandatory insurance program is likely to affect some 400,000 foreigners, it added. Foreigners here may face penalties unless they comply with the new requirement and pay on time, it stressed. Foreign subscribers to South Korea's state health insurance program numbered about 1 million in 2018, or 1.9 percent of the total subscribers tallied at 51.07 million, according to the NHIS. The figure represents a 68.4 percent surge from six years earlier.  The number of foreigners staying in South Korea came to 2.37 million last year, up 8.6 percent from the previous year.  yonngong@yna.co.kr (END)<end_of_turn>

# Offshore spending surge risks overruns up to $220 bln by 2023 -Rystad

OSLO, June 13 (Reuters) - Offshore oil services providers stand to gain as oil companies increase approvals for new projects, but the activity boom raises risks of cost overruns and could deter future spending, researcher Rystad Energy said on Thursday. A rush to accelerate projects, especially those involving tailor-made designs, increases the uncertainty of their final costs, typically 20% above or below the initial estimate. “For offshore operators, that means the expected variation for projects to be sanctioned during the period from 2019 to 2023 could be as high as $220 billion,” the research firm said. It expects over $100 billion in new offshore field projects around the world to be sanctioned on average per year in 2019-2023. In 2015-18, the average was $50 billion per year. Rystad added that the performance of projects in relation to initial cost estimates has historically influenced operators when deciding on subsequent project sanctioning. “Even if oil prices stay above $60 per barrel over the next five years, offshore sanctioning could slow down due to project performance,” Rystad said. Price deterioration has plagued oilfield service companies such as Aker Solutions and Halliburton as a result of the 2014-2016 oil price crash, with competition still fierce and overcapacity looming. Prices of offshore services have however started to rise again. Rystad Energy expects offshore unit prices to rise by 10-15% by the end of 2022, with the subsea segment in pole position after the industry reduced capacity in some particularly labour-intensive segments during the downturn. From 2015, fewer offshore projects were approved and the scope of projects shrunk, leading to lower equipment sales. The average weight of the top part of the platform at oil installations on order came down dramatically following the crash, and topside equipment unit prices have dropped nearly 20% since 2014, Rystad Energy research showed. “Subsea probably has some of the strongest growth, so we are pretty bullish on subsea activity picking up, whereas (the outlook for) other segments such as maintenance and operational support is pretty flat,” Matthew Fitzsimmons, Vice President of Rystad Energy’s Oilfield Service Research division told Reuters. Offshore service prices are lagging the development of the U.S. onshore industry, where the boom in shale activity has attracted resources. “I think U.S. shale is very strong, but that being said it is also very oversupplied in several segments, and there has been a lot of inflation there to date,” Fitzsimmons said. “Offshore hasn’t really seen much yet, inflation-wise, so I think that is going to start picking up over the next few years — not to the levels that is was in previous cycles, and I think it will be more paced than previously,” he added.

# Western Illinois University gets $375,000 to study bobcats

MACOMB, Ill. (AP) — The federal government is giving Western Illinois University $375,000 to keep researching the state's bobcat population.  The school says in a news release the two-year grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will allow WIU Biological Sciences Associate Professor of Wildlife Ecology Chris Jacques to continue research he's been conducting for several years and means students will be able to keep studying bobcat ecology across north central Illinois.  Jacques says that without the grant — which will be administered through the state's Department of Natural Resources — the research conducted he conducts with graduate and undergraduate students would have had to be halted at the end of 2019.  The grant money will allow Jacques to continue using remote cameras to estimate bobcat population densities in the region.<end_of_turn>

# Inside the AFC North: The most underpaid players for each team

cleveland.com CLEVELAND, Ohio – The Browns wrapped up their mandatory minicamp last week, and now it's into the offseason they go. Over the next two weeks, Scott Patsko and Dan Labbe will take a look at the AFC North with a series of posts about acquisitions, contracts, key games and more. Today, we look at the most underpaid players for each division team. Some players in the AFC North care clearly outperforming their contracts. Previously: Best acquisitions for each team Under-the-radar players for each team Most significant coaching changes Stanley was the sixth overall pick in the 2016 draft and has started every game he has played (42) for the Ravens over the past three seasons. He was Pro Football Focus’ fourth-ranked pass-blocking tackle last season (17th overall). He allowed just two sacks last season and his 17 pressures allowed were second-fewest among tackles with at least 400 pass blocking snaps. Stanley has done this while still on his rookie deal, which will pay him a base salary of $3.2 million this season, with a cap hit of $6.5 million. The Ravens have already picked up the fifth-year option on Stanley’s deal, which will pay him $12.8 million in 2020. So don’t expect to see him on a list like this again. Boyd had a breakout season in 2018, finishing with a team-high 76 catches for 1,028 yards and seven touchdowns in 14 starts. It was quite a leap after just three starts and 76 total catches over his first two seasons. Boyd had just three drops in 108 targets last season, picking up the slack while injuries limited A.J. Green to nine games. The 2016 second-round pick of the Bengals could potentially get a contract extension before this season begins. But as of now he is entering the final year of his rookie deal, which has a base salary of $980,000 and a cap hit of $1.3 million this season.<end_of_turn>

# Star-studded cast claims sports hardware

The off-season keeps getting shorter for Damien Giroux. Not only did the Hanmer native and Minnesota Wild Prospect enjoy a lengthy playoff run as captain of the OHL’s Saginaw Spirit, leading the team to its first-ever conference final appearance, but he joined the Iowa Wild as an extra player for their journey through the American Hockey League post-season, which wrapped up just two weeks ago. Happily, the 19-year-old returned to the city just in time to attend the Greater Sudbury Sports Hall of Fame’s Sports Celebrity Dinner and Awards, held in a packed Caruso Club on Wednesday night, where he picked up Amateur Male Athlete of the Year honours. “It’s a huge honour for me,” Giroux told The Sudbury Star. “I grew up watching the Sudbury Wolves play and to be able to play in the OHL against them, coming back once a year and playing in front of family and friends, to be able to bring back this huge honour, it’s indescribable at this point. It means a lot to me and it’s something I wouldn’t have been able to do without my family by my side, my parents, who have done so much for me, my grandparents, who used to bring me to every practice — it’s a huge team effort and it’s something I’m really not taking for granted.” Wearing the captain’s C for the first time as a junior, Giroux had a career year in 2018-19, recording 30 goals and 21 assists in 67 regular-season games. The 5-foot-10, 185-pounder followed up with nine goals and four assists in 17 playoff contests, cementing his status as the city’s top amateur athlete despite a healthy challenge from fellow nominees Logan Spicer, a rising track and field star, and Jeff Walton, an OUA volleyball standout. “It was a big learning curve this season, not only on the ice, but off the ice, as a person,” Giroux said. “It’s how you treat your teammates, how you treat your coaches, billets and everyone with respect, and it’s also approaching every day, wanting to get better, whether it’s in the gym or on the ice. You want to make a difference, you want to get better somehow, and I think that was the biggest learning curve for me.” In addition to handing out annual awards and recognizing the latest group of inductees into the Greater Sudbury Sports Hall of Fame, Wednesday’s event continued the tradition of honouring hall-of-famers who had passed away in the last year. Among them was Norm Mayer, former sports editor at The Sudbury Star and longtime historian for the hall of fame committee, who succumbed to a heart condition less than a week before the ceremony. Chris Sheridan, founder of the sports hall of fame, paid tribute to his friend and collaborator, before master of ceremonies Joe Drago led those in attendance in observing a moment of silence. Another OHL standout, Sudbury Wolves goalie Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, was named as Import Athlete of the Year, ahead of Sudbury Five guard Braylon Rayson and Laurentian basketball guard Kadre Gray, a former winner himself. As previously announced, Volunteer of the Year honourees were Cora Babij, for her ongoing efforts in girls hockey, and Frank Apolloni, for his longtime involvement in boxing. Winner of Elite Athlete of the Year, amongst a relatively large group of worthy nominees, was Columbus Blue Jackets captain Nick Foligno, a finalist for the NHL’s Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. Nominees included Canadian national women’s soccer team member Jenna Hellstrom, Detroit Red Wings forward Tyler Bertuzzi and para-Nordic skier Collin Cameron. Amateur Female Athlete of the Year honours went to Josee Seguin, a Special Olympics powerlifter who won three gold medals and one silver at the World Summer Games in the United Arab Emirates in March. Nominees included some star student-athletes at the OUA level, including Marianne Alarie in basketball and Karli Shell in hockey, as well as Kira Brunton in curling. In a choice that reflected a body of work, as much as a successful season, longtime Laurentian Voyageurs women’s soccer coach Rob Gallo was named Joe Drago Coach of the Year, edging out hockey bench bosses Cory Stillman, of the Wolves, and Drew Bannister, of the Soo Greyhounds, and Laurentian curling coach Ryan Lafreniere. Gallo, well aware of the exploits of his fellow nominees, called his win “a shocker.” “It’s always nice to be recognized as I think this is an award that recognizes the efforts I have put in over 20 years to build a program,” said Gallo, who has retired as Laurentian’s coach, but plans to stay on in an advisory role for the 2019 fall season. “I’m hoping now, when the school decides to hire the next coach, that we can move the team forward into the proper hands. I’m quite overwhelmed with this and it’s not expected, but it’s a nice touch to end my career in coaching, being involved in the game over 50 years, 20 years as a head coach at Laurentian. It was a good time.” Deserving recipients of Chris Sheridan Team of the Year Honours were members of the national-champion Croisier rink — Bella Croisier, Jamie Smith, Piper Croisier, Lauren Rajala and coach Shawn Croisier. Also nominated was the Laurentian rink of Brunton, Megan Smith, Alyssa Denyer, Mikaela Cheslock, Emma Johnson and coach Lafreniere, the Sudbury Five basketball team and the Sudbury Lady Wolves midget AA hockey club. Mike Martyn, from the Sudbury District Hockey Officials Association, was given the Bill Roman Administration Award. Also nominated was Dan Welch from the Northern Water Sports Centre, as well as the 2018 Telus Cup host committee. The sports awards committee decided the organizing committee for the 2019 Esso Cup, which took place in Sudbury in late April, will be considered for the award next year. Lauren Fearn of Lo-Ellen Park Secondary School was named as High School Female Athlete of the Year. Hannah Nykilchyk from Lockerby Secondary School and Ariane Saumure from Ecole secondaire Macdonald-Cartier rounded out the list of nominees. Another Lo-Ellen representative, Kurtis Wennerstrom, was named High School Male Athlete of the Year. Mike Babcock from Lasalle Secondary School was also nominated. It was a rare tie for Dr. Fred Sheridan High School Team of the Year, but another win for the Lo-Ellen Knights, as the Nordic ski squad shared the honour with the track and field team.<end_of_turn>

# Meters coming for consumers - The Nation Newspaper

THERE is hope for electricity consumers to get meters as Metering Solution Manufacturing Service Limited(MSMSL) has offered to assist other meter asset providers (MAPs).  The development, follows the inability of the Meter Assets Providers(MAP) recently approved by the Federal Government to get enough meters for consumers, that were under their jurisdictions.  In line with the MAPs regulation issued by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission(NERC), MAPs are expected to partner the 11 power distribution companies (DisCos) to ensure seamless distribution to the consumers.  Also, the regulations stated that MAPs must meet at least 30 per cent local content in meter supplies, an issue that has become a challenge in the sector. Signing a metering agreement with the Eko Electricity Distribution Company(EKEDC) in Lagos, a firm, Metering Solution ManufacturingService Limited(MSMSL), offered to end the metering problem in the country.  Armese Power Solutions Chief Executive Officer Aslam Khorkar said the firm will plunge the gap in the production and supply of meters.  Khorkar said: “ Our manufacturing subsidiary operating as Metering Manufacturing Solutions Manufaturing Service Limited(MSMSL) has the capacity to produce three million meters yearly on a multi-shift pattern.<end_of_turn>

# Exclusive: Philly’s animal shelter dissed in confidential Ivy League vet school report | Stu Bykofsky

The city’s animal shelter, ACCT Philly, is a disgrace to Philadelphia and has been for decades.  ACCT Philly’s future ability to provide healthy, humane care for animals is grim unless changes are made. That’s according to a confidential report commissioned by the shelter during a recent deadly outbreak of canine pneumovirus. The shelter stopped dog adoptions for two weeks as it fought the disease.  The 11-page report, which I have obtained, was prepared primarily by the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, with input from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Florida.  ACCT Executive Director Susan Russell, who declined to comment on the contents of the report, tells me she ordered it “to get analysis of what we could do better, to prevent future outbreaks.” The recent outbreak, during which eight dogs died and dozens more were sickened, was the shelter’s third in 15 years.  ACCT has a two-pronged problem, the report says:  Disease can sweep through the shelter because it can’t isolate sick animals. During the outbreak, tents were used to segregate healthy dogs.  “Without a separate humane space for dogs with upper respiratory symptoms to be housed,” ACCT will continue to have outbreaks, the report predicts.  The physical side is lacking, but the personnel side has problems, too.  In January, Controller Rebecca Rhynhart severely criticized the Managing Director’s Office, which oversees ACCT, for being oblivious to mismanagement by the shelter’s former leadership.  Money is another problem. The Cornell report says that “comparable municipal animal shelters” spend between $350 and $475 per animal. Philadelphia spends $237 per animal. (ACCT shelters about 18,000 animals a year, mostly dogs and cats.)  In 2017 testimony before City Council, Philadelphia animal activist Marsha Perelman, speaking as a board member of the Humane Society of the United States, said the city “is dead last among major cities” in spending on its shelter.  That’s shameful.  At that same hearing, Councilman Bobby Henon, who occupied City Council’s seat on the ACCT board, described what he called “Philadelphia’s failure to adequately fund and support” the shelter.  But what was done? Nothing.  Henon has been replaced on the board by Councilman Allan Domb, known as a dog-lover. The shelter is “a disgrace,” he tells me, “just unacceptable for a city like Philadelphia.”  The board is being expanded. Perelman has joined it, along with former mayor and governor Ed Rendell, another dog lover.  The report lightly criticizes ACCT leadership for often stepping in to walk dogs or clean cages, which is below their level of responsibility. ACCT volunteer Brenda Johnson, one of the signers of an open letter to the mayor and managing director seeking more funding for ACCT, tells me she has seen Russell on her hands and knees scouring kennels.  Let’s get back to the space issue. ACCT has 19,000 square feet. Under the same roof, an additional 13,000 square feet are occupied by Vector Control, the city’s rat-catching agency.  The quickest and cheapest solution to ACCT’s space problem is to relocate Vector Control, perhaps to a vacant public school building. I’ve been hearing that for years, but nothing happens.  I first wrote about the animal shelter in 2004, when it was called PACCA. It was then a house of horrors for animals.  Over the years piecemeal improvements were made, but ACCT remains underfunded, understaffed, and a civic embarrassment. It is a loud, dirty, terrifying environment for animals.  Getting it to where it should be requires money, yes, but also public outcry and political will.<end_of_turn>

# Testing out the serum that's meant to lift and contour your face in minutes

I was getting dressed for a work event before a quick glance at the mirror made me think twice about stepping out of the hotel room at all that evening. I felt and looked the worse for wear, still jet-lagged and puffy from the flight. It was as good a time as any to put the new V Shaping Facial Lift from Clarins to the test for the first time. Goodness knows I needed the help. The cream-like serum easily absorbed into skin, and while waiting (and hoping) for a little "magic" to take place, I dutifully followed the instructions of the "auto-lifting method", a form facial massage (face-patting, really) that's supposed to help lymphatic drainage along. When I looked back up at the mirror a few minutes later, my face looked hydrated and significantly less puffy – and was smooth to the touch. Much better.  TACKLING THE DOWNWARD PULL OF GRAVITY The anti-ageing game plan we are familiar with typically combats lines and wrinkles but wrinkle-free skin doesn't necessarily equal firm, youthful-looking skin. Beauty giants are now wising up to the fact that the traditional anti-ageing regime they devised is missing a vital step: Facial contouring to combat lax skin caused by gravity. That’s where Clarins’ new contouring serum comes in – to be the face-saving solution that lifts and contours the natural face shape of Asian women. "It is like wearing a corset on the face, that immediate tightening effect instantly lifts and contours the face." “The most effective way to fight back against gravity is by maintaining the skin’s supportive network. It is this fibrous system that helps skin retain its lifted appearance through visible contours,” Marie-Helene Lair, Clarins’ scientific communications director, explained to CNA Lifestyle in Shanghai. “With the new V Shaping Facial Lift, it is like wearing a corset on the face, that immediate tightening effect instantly lifts and contours the face.” Lair likens our battle against gravity to nature’s fight against soil erosion. Taking a cue from Mother Nature, the serum taps into organic agropyron extract (commonly referred to as wheatgrass) as its star ingredient. The plant is known for its leading role in fighting soil erosion because of its powerful gripping power that comes from its extensive and continuously growing underground stem network. Clinical studies on agropyron extracts register a 158 per cent spike in collagen production when introduced to the skin’s supportive network. PUFFINESS, BEGONE “Another benefit of this star ingredient is its ability to limit the formation of new fat-storing cells,” said Lair. A puffy face hides away the natural shape of one’s cheekbones and even mimics the look of a double chin. “To make perfectly sure we destock lipids and water retention, organic guarana extract (an Amazonian plant that is used in weight loss), plant caffeine, zerumbet ginger extract and horse chestnut are also added into the formula.” Chinese actress Zhong Chuxi – the newly appointed Clarins global beauty ambassador –may be a Size 0 but she’s not exempt from feeling bloated. “I have come to rely on this serum especially on days I have not had enough rest or when I feel particularly bloated,” she said. “I also apply it on my neck and collarbone to get rid of lipid and water retention in those areas as well.” Before you start piling on the serum thinking that more is more, Lair said it is not necessary to layer the formula as a little goes a long way. “Unlike moisturisers, there is no need to pile on the contouring serum. You’ll feel the tightening effect after just one layer.” She suggested maximising the serum’s efficacy by following up with the auto-lifting massage method. “Warm two to three pumps of the serum in your palms then pat the serum onto your face, neck and collarbone. Using the weight of your head for pressure, hang your head down into cupped palms. Start on the eyes and forehead, before moving onto the cheekbones, followed by the face and then the jaw. Thereafter, gently rest the jaw on your knuckles for several seconds and finish off by tapping firmly on your collarbones.”   “Unlike moisturisers, there is no need to pile on the contouring serum. You’ll feel the tightening effect after just one layer.” According to Lair, the collarbone is the control centre for lymphatic drainage. “For an extra boost to drain excess fluid and lipids from the face, I’m all for spending extra time on the collarbone. I like to start my own massage with firm taps on the collarbone to jump start the system before applying the auto-lifting massage and then end it with even firmer taps on the collarbone.” Beauty influencer and new mum Jayne Tham tried the auto-lifting method and was “shocked” by her own reflection. “After birth, the last few kilos were really hard to shed and water retention was too real. Plus, I’m turning 30 very soon so I needed a solution to firm and contour my face.” Tham saw immediate results from the get-go. “I didn’t expect to see such an obvious difference." Actor Xu Bin has also jumped on the V Shape bandwagon. "As an actor, I am concerned about how I look on-screen, especially in the morning when my face is puffy." "After using the serum, I see a noticeable difference," said the 30-year-old. "Not only does it de-puff, my face feels firmer and smoother, even my pores look smaller." CNA Lifestyle was in Shanghai at the invitation of Clarins.<end_of_turn>

# Love Island beauty Maura Higgins sparks rumours she’s had bum implants

Love Island 2019 beauty Maura Higgins has sparked rumours she’s had bum implants by posting epic before and after shots of her rear.  The Irish stunner, 28, is causing chaos in the villa after turning Tommy Fury's head with her sultry good looks.  Before joining the show she was working as a ring girl and regularly posted pictures of her incredible figure.  A picture dating back to 2017 show her giving her bum a major makeover.  Although some speculated she could have had a bum lift, the transformation was put down to strenuous exercise.  She shared the snap to Instagram's Transformation Page and revealed she changed her body in just six weeks.  Although you don't see her face, her large tattoo is clearly visible.  In tonight's show, Maura cracked onto Tommy even though he's coupled up with Molly-Mae - and even told him to ditch the blonde Instagrammer.  The couple ended up having a massive argument in tonight's show as Molly-Mae blew up at Tommy over his intimate chats with Maura.  Tommy told her: "She’s come in here and I’ve had a connection with her.  "I like the girl and I’m going to get to know her."  Molly-Mae insisted: "I thought spending every day together, sharing a bed together would be enough to make you realise that I do like you.”  But he replied: "It just feels like you’re keeping your options open.”  The social media influencer fumed: "I want to have a boy in my life that literally worships the ground I walk on. Do you not think I feel threatened by a stunning girl that's come in that's a ring girl? The guy that I like is a f***ing boxer! How do you think I feel?"  *Love Island airs nightly at 9pm on ITV2<end_of_turn>

# Facebook Monitors Users’ Offline Behaviour to Determine ‘Hate Agents’ – Reports

The signals include a wide range of on- and off-platform behaviour. If you praise the wrong individual, interview them, or appear at events alongside them, Facebook may categorize you as a “hate agent.”  Facebook could also categorize you as a hate agent if you self-identify with or advocate for a “Designated Hateful Ideology;” if you associate with a “Designated Hate Entity;” if you have “tattoos of hate symbols or hate slogans, or for possession of “hate paraphernalia,” although the document provides no examples of what falls into this last category. Facebook, according to the document, will also consider “statements made in private but later made public.”  The document also shows that Facebook divides hate speech into three tiers depending on severity and considers attacks on a person’s “immigration status” off and on the social media platform to be hate speech.  “Individual has made public statements, or statements made in private and later made public, using Tier 1, 2, or 3 hate speech or slurs: 3 instances in one statement or appearance = signal; 5 instances in multiple statements or appearances over one month = signal,” the document reads.  Other signals used by Facebook to determine if its users should be designated as hate agents include carrying out violence against people based on their “protected or quasi-protected characteristics,” attacks on places of worship, and conviction of genocide.<end_of_turn>

# Ariana Grande Gets A Shout Out In The New ‘MIB’ & The “NASA” Singer Has To Be Thrilled

The Ariana Grande Joke In ‘Men In Black: International’ References Her Love Of Outer Space Mild spoilers ahead. The new Men in Black movie might switch things up from the first three films with a couple of brand new stars, but everything else is about the same: There's a mission involving otherworldly beings. There are black suits and sunglasses. And there's a running joke about some celebrities actually being aliens who have taken on human form. This time around, one of those celebs is Ariana Grande, who gets a shoutout in Men in Black: International. The basic premise of this fourth MIB movie is that a woman named Molly (Tessa Thompson) becomes obsessed with finding the Men in Black after an encounter with them as a child. She ends up coming on board with the organization for a probationary period. Now known as Agent M, she starts working with a Man in Black who has been there for a while, known as Agent H (Chris Hemsworth). And then, you know, alien missions ensue. But it's during Agent M's introduction to the Men in Black world that she finds out that more aliens are living on Earth than she ever imagined. In fact, some of them are disguised as celebrities and are monitored on a big screen at the MIB office. The first celebrity to pop up? Miss "thank u, next" herself. Yep, Ariana Grande is an alien walking this Earth and becoming a hugely successful pop star while she's at it. She does have a song called "NASA" — and actually visited NASA — so the space interest in there. Plus, I mean... The proof was always there. Next up, the screen shows Elon Musk, which checks out, but, dude, you aren't hiding it well. And following Musk is Donald Glover, about whom Agent M says, "That actually makes sense." M doesn't explain herself, but maybe it's clear he's an alien because he's talented in so many ways. Or maybe it's because he's so comfortable in outer space. These are the main glimpses of the celebrity alien watch screen that audiences get in the movie, but it does show up in the background of another scene later in the film. It's a quick flash this time around, but it looks like filmmaker J.J. Abrams is also an alien. Again, makes sense for a few reasons. This joke of celebs being aliens started with the first Men in Black movie in 1997. In that movie, the aliens mentioned included Danny DeVito, Al Roker, Newt Gingrich, Dionne Warwick, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg, the latter of whom executive produced the movie. In Men in Black II, Michael Jackson showed up as an undercover alien agent. In the third movie, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, and Tim Burton were aliens. But aliens don't have to disguise themselves as celebrities. (I guess just the ones who are already really talented entertainers do?) They can also disguise themselves as animals, as shown through Frank the Pug, a character from the first movie, who also has a cameo in MIB: International. The aliens can also just walk around in their alien form as long as they're careful. One alien in the new movie even pretends to be someone's beard, thanks to his furry appearances. Men in Black: International comes out on June 14, so maybe if the celebrity aliens featured see it — or if someone tells them about it — they'll let us know what they think. I would imagine the space-loving Grande would be pretty excited.<end_of_turn>

# Dolphins Quarterback Battle

No doubt it’s really hot in South Florida, but it’s not just the weather we’re talking about, it’s the Dolphins quarterback competition. So far through offseason workouts it seems that the veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick holds the edge over the youngster Josh Rosen. Fitzpatrick is generating buzz not just with his arm but with his command of the huddle.  The guy can sling the football. Last season, he set an NFL record, becoming the first player in league history to throw for 400 yards in three straight games. So clearly he has skills as a thrower and a leader.  The question is, will Josh Rosen do enough in the offseason, including training camp, to wrestle the quarterback job away from Fitz. Last season as a rookie, Rosen threw for almost 2300 yards, with 11 touchdowns and 14 picks, but played in front of one of the worst offensive lines in the NFL. Let’s see what he can do with more stability in front of him and around him.<end_of_turn>

# Fort Lauderdale man kidnapped, assaulted tourist, police say

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A Fort Lauderdale man was arrested after he allegedly kidnapped and sexually assaulted a tourist last month. Ainsworth Jerome McGregor, 23, was charged on numerous counts, including kidnapping, sexual assault with a weapon, and attempted murder.  After McGregor and the victim had met earlier in the week and discussed purchasing drugs, police say McGregor picked up the woman from her Fort Lauderdale Beach hotel on May 15 and drove her to an isolated area in the woods and prevented her from leaving the car. When the victim refused McGregor's sexual advances, he said "don't make me do this" and pulled out a gun. McGregor then allegedly made the victim remove her clothes and demanded she perform oral sex at gunpoint. A struggle ensued after the victim was able to reach for the gun. The weapon did not have a round chambered when McGregor attempted to fire the weapon. The victim escaped out of the driver's door and began to run into the woods, but was soon grabbed by McGregor who threatened to kill her. The arrest report claims McGregor repeatedly strangled the woman, causing her to stop breathing at least five times. After 10-15 minutes, McGregor ran out of the woods, leaving his gun behind. A passerby found the woman naked from the waist down and covered in mud wearing only one of her boots. Video survelliance from the victim's hotel was able to identify McGregor's car and the woman was able to ID her attacker in a photo lineup.

# Top uni wants to lower entry standards to counter student exodus

One of Sydney's top universities wants to lower its entry standards for year 12 students and delay lifting English language requirements for overseas students to battle a multi-million dollar revenue shortfall. "A below-the-radar approach is recommended to protect reputation," said one of the slides presented to staff and obtained by the Herald. The University of New South Wales lost $14.2 million after more than 800 domestic students dropped out before or early in term one and the number of first year international students fell by 222, documents show. University executives responded by proposing to cut entry requirements for local students by reviewing subject prerequisites and reducing ATARs for some courses, staff were told during a strategy briefing late last month. UNSW has already done this in engineering; students with ATARs as low as 83 - the published rank is 93 - are considered for that course if they provide a personal statement, their year 12 report and a video showing why they are suitable. The university has already paused "further upward changes to academic and English requirements [for oveseas students] until market conditions improve," the meeting was told. UNSW's English standards are now the same as its Group of Eight competitors. Extra strategies to reverse the international student drop included a plan to lure students who have deferred their studies at other institutions "through targeted agent communications," the meeting was told. It did not say whether those institutions would be local or international, but mentioned the "traditional July intake", a date on the Australian higher education calendar. In the northern hemisphere, intakes are in August or September. Agents recruit students in overseas markets and claim a slice of tuition fees as commission. To boost international numbers, UNSW is also considering waiving more application fees, launching more international scholarships and trialling a China call centre, or "offshore contact hub", next year. More than 270 locals dropped out before classes began in term one, and another 575 dropped out within the first few weeks, the presentation slides show. The university will undertake market research to find out why. International undergraduate commencements also dropped by 12 per cent, or 222 students, while overseas students beginning postgraduate degrees fell by three per cent, or 80 students. The fall was blamed on fewer students coming from its associated business, NSW Global, which provides diploma and English programs; market adjustment to new English entry requirements; and some students failing to get visas on time. The shortfall comes in a difficult year for one of Australia's leading universities, amid complaints from staff and students that its move from two academic terms to three has created an unviable workload. The move to a trimester system resulted in UNSW's academic year beginning earlier than other universities', meaning UNSW had less time to "convert" - convince interested applicants to choose its courses - than its rivals. But Andrew Norton, who works on higher education policy at the Grattan Institute, said international students tended to prefer trimesters. "It enables them to finish their degree in less calendar time," he said. The UNSW presentation revealed that total domestic revenue for term one was $198 million, and total international revenue was $266 million. Improved performance from the Study Abroad - or exchange business - of $7.5 million helped offset the lost $14 million. Across NSW universities, international student commencements rose by 3226 students in the year to March, government data shows. International students are an important source of income for Australia's higher education sector, especially after the federal government froze its funding at 2017 levels. A spokeswoman for UNSW said it now had more international students on campus than ever before, "and we are proud to have one of the world's largest global student communities". "In 2019, there has been a slight decline in international student commencements at UNSW. Much of this is linked to a drop in students coming from UNSW Global, Australia's leading provider of high-quality pathways education. "A change in direction and leadership of UNSW Global has recently been announced - and is addressing the decline in pathway students. This decline is affecting the higher education sector more broadly."<end_of_turn>

The cost is $10 and will cover morning snacks, camp T-shirt and packet. Children often see farm and livestock operations as an exciting playground – providing endless hours of fun and adventure. But these facilities and the livestock and equipment on them also can set the stage for tragedy. I never thought of the farm as being such a dangerous place. Each year, many children are killed or injured on America’s farms. In fact, children ages 5 to 14 have the highest rate of injury among all farm workers. This summer, farm safety day camps, are being held across South Dakota to teach urban and rural children how to prevent injuries or reduce the risk of farm accidents. During the camps, children participate in interactive activities that reinforce the importance of taking responsibility for their own safety, respecting parents’ safety rules and sharing safety tips with their family and friends. Registration forms can be found online at www.codington.org/extension-service/ and at the Codington County Extension Office.

# I Can Go for That: The Smooth World of Yacht Rock review – lushly comforting

Friday night on BBC Four: time for a documentary aimed at the sort of music fan who, when it comes to genre categorisation, appreciates the finer things. It’s important to separate, for example, yacht rock from the slightly but crucially different sounds of soft rock, smooth rock, FM rock, AOR, MOR, cocaine rock and wine-bar pop. To do that, Katie Puckrik moseyed through the cultural shifts in America in the 70s in part one of I Can Go for That: The Smooth World of Yacht Rock.  A good genre-based rockumentary is always about the social change that brought about the new style, and if that part’s done well it can compensate for any shortcomings of the musical appreciation itself. We heard how the death of 60s mass-movement idealism led, in the new decade, to introspective individualism, personified by the solo singer-songwriters who congregated in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. Then bands came back in vogue, retaining the lush, laid-back sound while dialling down the navel-gazing lyrics to create the perfect soundtrack for listeners trying to ignore Watergate and Vietnam.  This reassuringly vague escapism spread into middle America, helped by the rise of FM radio and boosted by the idea that women were now controlling household spending and would enjoy smooth but heartfelt ballads, with the flipside of that gender emancipation being that men felt freer to convey their emotions in song. Meanwhile, Reaganite consumerism was looming, and pop production was becoming more sophisticated, yet Californian pop was still expected to offer some token counterculturalism.  What did all this amount to? Essentially, the Doobie Brothers. Puckrik majored on the “lovely, comforting, furry vocals” of hairy Doobies singer Michael McDonald but, despite all the Spotify playlists and not-ironic club nights that have retrospectively made it a thing, comprehensively defining yacht rock – aspirational but not luxurious, jaunty but lonely, pained but polished – is hard. Then again, part of the glory of micro-genres is the way certain records are arbitrarily ruled in or out. So here, Michael Jackson’s Thriller: yacht. Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours: not yacht. What?  Hall and Oates gave the show its title and they were definitely canon, performing the coolly anguished She’s Gone in a 1976 archive clip that must have been a formative influence on Flight of the Conchords. John Oates was interviewed in the present day but was, amid a sea of yacht-rock bloggers and semi-interested rock critics, one of very few contributors who had set sail themselves.  Puckrik filled the gaps, more essayist than presenter as she applied her hazy intelligence to Steely Dan, America and the Eagles, while nailing the overall feel of yacht rock with the phrase “ennui deluxe”. There’s a touch of ennui deluxe about I Can Go for That, stretched as it is across two languid episodes (next week: the 80s) when one would have sufficed. But who cares that these Friday-night BBC Four rockumentaries have been mining that era of pop for so long, it’s turned to sparkling dust? Letting it lazily run through our fingers feels good.<end_of_turn>

# Pachter: PS5 and Project Scarlett Could be Priced at $399

Pachter: PS5 and Project Scarlett Could be Priced at $399 - News William D'Angelo , posted 1 hour ago / 937 Views Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter in an interview with GamingBolt said the specs for the PlayStation 5 and Project Scarlett suggest the price for consoles will be $500 at launch. However, he believes Microsoft will announce a price of $399 and Sony not wanting to fall behind in sales will set the same price for the PlayStation 5.  "The specs suggest $500 or so," said Pachter. "But my bias is that Microsoft will announce $399 and Sony will follow suit."   Head of Xbox Phil Spencer during an E3 live stream said, "the price will be important" for Project Scarlett. "Clearly price is one of these things people want to know, and as we’re kind of watching the cost of the components that are coming in, things like tearups and other things, trying to figure out what that price is going to be next year."  Microsoft will launch Project Scarlett in Holiday 2020, while Sony has yet to announce a release window of the PlayStation 5.  A life-long and avid gamer, William D'Angelo was first introduced to VGChartz in 2007. After years of supporting the site, he was brought on in 2010 as a junior analyst, working his way up to lead analyst in 2012. He has expanded his involvement in the gaming community by producing content on his own YouTube channel and Twitch channel dedicated to gaming Let's Plays and tutorials.

# Province presents 8,000-page document to regulators for Springbank Reservoir project

Province presents 8,000-page document to regulators for Springbank Reservoir project  (Photo: Alberta Government)  Published Friday, June 14, 2019 6:42AM MDT Last Updated Friday, June 14, 2019 2:17PM MDT The Alberta government is responding to formal questions from provincial and federal regulators about the proposed Springbank Reservoir project with an 8,000 page document.  The document is in response to requests for further information received last year from Alberta Environment and Parks, the Natural Resources Conservation Board and the federal Canadians Environmental Assessment Agency.  “This submission demonstrates our commitment to doing everything necessary to complete the regulatory process for the Springbank Reservoir,” said McIver.  “Officials with Alberta Transportation have taken great care and the proper time to do this right, to provide a thorough and comprehensive response to the information requests and move this critical project through the regulatory procedure process.”  The Springbank Reservoir is a $432-million project that would be located about 15 kilometres west of Calgary, near Springbank Road, north of the Elbow River and predominantly east of Highway 22.  The dry reservoir would work in conjunction with the Glenmore Reservoir to temporarily store water in the event of a flood. At capacity, the reservoir would be able to store water volumes equal to the 2013 flood — roughly 28,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.  Once regulatory approval is received, officials expect the Springbank Reservoir to be operational within two construction seasons and fully completed within three construction seasons.  McIver says flood mitigation is very important for the City of Calgary and the province should have no intention of “dragging its heels.”  The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency promises to engage with the public prior to a final decision on the Springbank Reservoir, but offered no clear timeline of when that could happen.  The Calgary River Communities Action Group has also suggested the earliest the project could be finished would be sometime around 2023.  Growing concerns  Despite the province taking next steps to get the Springbank Reservoir approved, there is still growing controversy around the project.  The Tsuut’ina Nation is now renewing a campaign against the reservoir which sits about 400 metres north of the First Nation and squarely in its territory.  The First Nation remains strongly opposed to the projects because of unknowns surrounding ground water resources, including the quality and quantity of drinking water. There are also concerns of an increased risk of flooding on the reserve.  The Springbank Community Association is also questioning the reservoir, as it’s purely a flood mitigation option, but not able to address drought, water management and supply.  Even some members of the UCP aren’t on board with the project. Banff-Kananaskis MLA Miranda Rosin has asked the transportation minister to reconsider the Springbank Reservoir and instead take another look at the McLean Creek Dam, a proposal which was quashed years ago.  The online group, DamMcLeanCreek, also views that proposal as an option that could potentially ease concerns on Calgary’s future water supply and protect upstream communities like Bragg Creek and Redwood Meadows.  Councillors in Rocky View County also met earlier this year and voted in favour of formally opposing the plan.  The county says the reservoir project directly impacts 87 residential homes on or near the reservoir and would result in the loss of nearly 1,600 hectares of ranch land.<end_of_turn>

# Soller train graffiti condemned

The Association of Friends of the Railway took to Facebook yesterday to denounce graffiti on a Soller train carriage.  The association said that it condemned this latest attack on Majorca's railway heritage."We demand that the law be applied to those responsible and the maximum speed in their arrest." An investigation has been opened to identify the perpetrators.  This is not the first time that the Soller train has been the target for vandals. In 2008, four youths from Barcelona were arrested by Palma police for graffiti.<end_of_turn>

# Lesbian couple attacked on London bus say teen attackers 'got excited by watching'

Melania Geymonat, 28, and her American partner Chris, 29, said they were punched and robbed following an evening in West Hampstead, north west London, in a homophobic attack on May 30. The teenagers made crude remarks and sexual gestures, demanding that the couple kiss. When Melania and Chris refused, they allegedly punched both women in the face and robbed them of a smartphone and a purse. A horrifying picture shows the bloodied couple in the aftermath of the attack. Melania, a doctor from Uruguay and a Ryanair flight attendant, told The Times: “In the first place they came towards us because we were seen as sexual objects.   “It’s not the first time this happens to me that I’m with a girlfriend or on a date and men tend to be excited by watching. “That’s one of the things that really annoyed me. I’m 28 so it has been ten years that I’ve seen this. We are not performing. It feels really humiliating to be treated [like that].” Melania is now concerned about showing affection to her girlfriend in public. She added: “My rational opinion is that I will but if I am on the bus at 1am in the morning, I don’t know if I will do it … I tend to think I will, but I just don’t know.” Five teenagers aged between 15 and 18 have been charged with robbery and aggravated grievous bodily harm. “In the first place they came towards us because we were seen as sexual objects” Melania Geymonat All five have been bailed until early July. Both women were taken to hospital and treated for facial injuries. Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn afterwards condemned the attack. The interim Prime Minister said: “This was a sickening attack and my thoughts are with the couple affected. “Nobody should ever have to hide who they are or who they love and we must work together to eradicate unacceptable violence towards the LGBT community.” Corbyn added: “We must not, and will not, accept this homophobic and misogynist violence in our society. “Solidarity to Melania and Chris, and to all in the LGBT+ community for everything they endure for simply being who they are.” The Metropolitan Police’s Det Supt Andy Cox said: "This was a disgusting attack on two women who appear to have been picked out and targeted by a group of youths. "CCTV footage from the attack is being reviewed by detectives. We continue to appeal for information from the public, particularly those who were present on the bus before or after the attack to come forward and tell police what they saw. "Lots of people will understandably be outraged by this attack. Our efforts to trace all the suspects involved and bring them in for questioning will be relentless. "Attacks of this nature on London buses are rare. I would like to reassure those heading out over the weekend that extra uniformed and plain clothes Safer Transport officers will be out on patrol working to keep them safe and prevent crime."<end_of_turn>

# Editorial: Discussion of a tax could loom for Chico

The news that Chico is going to be able to expand city staffing is sweet to hear, after years of cutbacks and then status quo.  However, those bad times may be passing, with positive indicators like low unemployment, new companies coming to town, and optimistic forecasts for the economy.  At least we hope the bad times are gone.  We have heard word of an economic downturn, but not in the same breath as 2019 or 2020.  The discussion last week about the budget wasn’t much more than a rubber stamp. Plenty of research and work went into the mix beforehand.  After viewing all perspectives, the city has nailed down its numbers and made the draft budget permanent.  As routine as it was, there was a moment that made us perk up. It was Councilor Karl Ory’s comment suggesting a possible tax to help the city should be discussed.  It’s not like we haven’t heard the T-word, both in government and private circles. But nothing has made it beyond suggestion — yet.  This discussion could be different. While city leaders are hopeful there is some kind of federal or state disaster assistance for Chico after the Camp Fire, nothing is readily apparent.  The help-needed list is long, from mending roads and dealing with housing issues, to solving commuter problems and dealing with added crime. There’s more to the list than those four areas.  If there was any time when Chico voters could be ready to approve a self-imposed tax, this could be it.  But there is a caveat to approval: The city has to show the tax will measurably improve what plagues Chico.  Of course, Chico voters have no way to reverse their vote should the financial high bar be missed.  Here’s another guess. If that one tax measure disappoints, the electorate will likely slam the door on future ones for a long time.<end_of_turn>

# Steve Gibson says EFL must act on Financial Fair Play 'cheating'

Steve Gibson has branded Championship sides that break strict rules on spending as ‘cheats’.  And the Boro chairman has reiterated his demands that the authorities must take sanctions against rogue clubs.  Gibson has been on a crusade to get the Football League to more robustly enforce their own Financial Fair Play regulations.  He has crossed swords with Derby, Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday in recent feisty Football League meetings and has even reportedly threatened legal action against the Rams.  And he was quizzed about his tough stance as new boss Jonathan Woodgate was unveiled at Rockliffe on Friday.  The chairman was asked straight: “Are clubs cheating on Financial Fair Play?”  And he answered with a clipped and emphatic: “Yes.”  With the charged answer hanging heavily in the air he was asked what the solution to the problem may be.  “That lies with the EFL,” said Gibson. “We’re just Middlesbrough, we’re just a minnow in this.  “The EFL and the other clubs have got to act against it.  “Everyone has to balance the books under Financial Fair Play and I keep on beating the drum because it disrupts football with the way events have happened in the last three or four years - but let’s move away from that, today isn’t about that. Today is about the appointment of Jonathan.”  But the subject was revisited when Gibson was asked if FFP would impact on Boro’s market muscle this summer.  “When you say finances are tight I’m not quite sure about that,” he said.  “But what I am quite sure about is that we have rules called Financial Fair Play and it’s important every rule is followed.  “If the rule is not going to be followed then don’t have it there. If the rule is there you expect people to abide by it.  “If we have a centre half who picks the ball up in the penalty area I don’t expect the referee to ignore it. If a player deceives the referee I don’t expect that to be ignored.  “And I don’t expect the EFL and other clubs to ignore Financial Fair Play either.  “It’s there, it’s a rule, it’s an important rule. It needs to be followed and if it’s not followed then sanctions must be taken against those clubs that cheat.”  But Gibson insisted that Boro would back new boss Woodgate in recruiting new talent.  “Of course we will, yes. We have a history of doing that don’t we?”<end_of_turn>

# Home Office 'loses' 750 foreign criminals on the run

Home Office 'loses' 750 foreign criminals including rapists and killers on the run to dodge deportation More than 700 offenders from overseas have vanished after being released Figures show that 49,381 foreign nationals disappeared as of last September A senior immigration source gave a grim assessment of ever catching them Tory leadership hopeful Sajid Javid is facing criticism over the Home Office’s failure to find hundreds of foreign criminals who have gone on the run to dodge deportation. Figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveal 747 offenders from overseas, including convicted rapists and killers, have vanished after being released into the community. A senior immigration source last night gave a grim assessment of the likelihood of the fugitives ever being caught. In another extraordinary case, a convicted sex attacker facing deportation managed to escape from a prison van. Kamil Malag, 36, escaped as he was being taken to Hewell Grange prison in Redditch after an appeal hearing ‘It’s not usually something we like to publish, but once you vanish you will only get caught by luck,’ he admitted. ‘There are no resources any more.’ Foreign citizens – including asylum seekers, those caught entering the UK unlawfully and those overstaying their visa – are meant to report regularly to immigration centres or police stations if there are potential grounds to deport them. But the figures, released under Freedom of Information laws, reveal that as of last September, 49,381 foreign nationals have disappeared. Alarmingly, an additional 747 foreign criminals – 681 men and 66 women – have also gone missing. They are believed to include Hektor Mahmutaj, a convicted killer on Interpol’s most-wanted list who disappeared while the Government was trying to extradite him. The 43-year-old is wanted in his native Albania after being sentenced in his absence in October 2000 to a 25-year jail term for shooting a farmer. He fled to the UK by hiding in a lorry and began a new life in Merseyside. But he was convicted of a string of crimes in the UK, including drink-driving, driving while disqualified and possession of a firearm in 2007, when he was jailed for two-and-a-half-years. He was released on conditional bail last year, but disappeared after Home Secretary Mr Javid signed an extradition order. In another extraordinary case, a convicted sex attacker facing deportation managed to escape from a prison van. Kamil Malag, 36, escaped as he was being taken to Hewell Grange prison in Redditch after an appeal hearing. The Home Office refused to disclose how the Polish national managed to escape on the M42 in February, but a source said last night that he was re-arrested in March and deported on May 22. Under Home Office rules, all foreign nationals given a jail sentence are considered for removal from the UK. But in a damning report in June 2017, Chief Inspector of Borders David Bolt revealed officials had lost track of 753 foreign criminals who faced deportation and that the team trying to find them had only 11 staff. Foreign citizens – including asylum seekers, those caught entering the UK unlawfully and those overstaying their visa – are meant to report regularly to immigration centres or police stations if there are potential grounds to deport them. The UK Border is pictured above in a stock image [File photo] Campaigners expressed shock that the number of foreign criminals ‘on the run’ has shrunk by only six since Mr Bolt’s report. ‘This is clear evidence of the continued failure of the Home Office to ensure the prompt removal of foreign offenders,’ said Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of Migration Watch UK. ‘Resources are clearly stretched, but there also seems to be a lack of political commitment.’ Lucy Moreton of the Immigration Services Union also warned that more serious criminals ‘tend to have more in-depth criminal connections and consequently are harder to find’. The number of foreign offenders deported dropped by 13 per cent in the year to November, a figure that Government sources say followed a Supreme Court ruling in June 2017 that found that deporting criminals before they had a chance to appeal breached their human rights. A Home Office spokesman said 48,000 foreign offenders had been removed since 2010, adding: ‘We have a dedicated team working with the police and others to track down, arrest and return absconders to custody. Since the team was formed in 2009 it has traced 2,250 absconders’.<end_of_turn>

# World Cup 2019: Predicting India's lineup against Pakistan

World Cup 2019: Predicting India's lineup against Pakistan  When the schedule for the World Cup 2019 was announced, most eyes were fixed on one fixture - India vs Pakistan. The numbers are a testament to the stature this encounter holds. With an estimated 1 billion television viewers and 700,000 applicants for the 26,000 seats in Old Trafford Stadium, this is without a doubt one of the biggest matches of the tournament. Ahead of the clash, here is a look at the best lineup for this encounter. With grey clouds incessantly looming over the stadium and the forecast raising doubts, it could be time for India to shift to a three-man pace attack. Openers With Shikhar Dhawan out owing to a thumb fracture, the team management decided that KL Rahul would open against New Zealand. One can expect India to stay with the combination against Pakistan. Rohit Sharma will be the key as he has been India’s most stable batsman in their two matches so far. Rahul is yet to prove a point as an opener and with this alliance giving rise to a new-look opening partnership, all eyes will be on Rahul and to see how he negotiates the moving new ball. Virat Kohli Virat Kohli has been a fulcrum for the Indian side for quite some time now and he’s been brilliant in taking up the massive responsibility accorded for the No 3 spot. He is going to play a massive role for India today against a pacy Pakistan bowling unit. Middle-order This is where things start getting a tricky for India. With Rahul moved to the opening slot, India need to fill the No 4 position once again with someone who can hold fort and ensure the death overs are fruitfully utilised. Vijay Shankar is probably the best option. With Hardik Pandya unable to make a big impact in the first two games, Shankar can add to the team in this aspect as well. He’s steady as the fifth bowler and is a reliable bat as well with a good 30-run innings almost a certainty every time he steps out to bat. At positions five and six should be MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya. These two can come and up the run-rate for India in the final 10 overs, something which will hold India in good stead on a surface where every run will count. The middle-order can be shuffled around according to the circumstances of the match, with either coming before Shankar if India are in need of quick runs. At No 7, Ravindra Jadeja should be a better fit than Kedar Jadhav. With no left-armers in the unit, Jadeja brings that dimension to the line-up and is more than articulate in bowling a restrictive brand of spin.  Bowling Order Talking about the Indian seamers, Mohammed Shami could be a value addition if the conditions are conducive and the rain makes an early foray before the match. It’s the best gameplan for India, especially against a Pakistan side known to be troubled by fast bowling. In Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shami, India have three pacers who have the variations to work Pakistan over. The lone spinner can be Yuzvendra Chahal, who can be supported by Jadeja/Jadhav. Pakistan play spin well and Jadeja can compensate for Kuldeep Yadav’s 10 overs of spin.<end_of_turn>

# India vs Pakistan, ICC World Cup 2019: Win or lose, tournament won’t end with Sunday’s game - Virat Kohli

India vs Pakistan, ICC World Cup 2019: Win or lose, tournament won’t end with Sunday’s game - Virat Kohli  Virat Kohli, six to seven times, the same question about the external pressure, hype and how tough this match could be and he very eloquently warded off all the queries, giving away very little. Updated: Jun 15, 2019 20:47 IST Manchester Immune to frenzy around every India-Pakistan clash, captain Virat Kohli says staying focussed on the bigger goal was important since the tournament would not end with World Cup’s most awaited match on Sunday. While he is aware of all the hoopla around the match, Kohli won’t let one World Cup contest dictate his thought process. The Indian captain was asked, six to seven times, the same question about the external pressure, hype and how tough this match could be and he very eloquently warded off all the queries, giving away very little. “The game starts at a certain time and finishes at a certain time. So this is not going to last a lifetime, if you do well or even if you don’t,” Kohli was at his pragmatic best during the pre-match interaction. For the skipper, the bigger picture -- winning the World Cup -- is what matters the most. “Whether we do well or not tomorrow, it’s not going to finish. The tournament still has to go on and focus has to be on larger picture. No one person takes more pressure than the others. “Eleven guys share the responsibility. The weather is not in anyone’s hands. We have to see whatever amount of game we get, we need to be mentally ready to do whatever we need to,” the skipper said. Being in constant limelight has made him very conscious about the electronic media looking for that ticker-grabber and the skipper wasn’t in a mood to relent. When a journalist from the vernacular electronic media asked him about the Virat vs Aamir battle, his response was sharp. “I will not say anything for creating TRPs and neither would I say something that creates an exciting news point. Any bowler I face, I only see the red or white ball. Yes, I respect a bowler’s skill set. I had said the same about Kagiso Rabada,” Kohli said. But he did make it clear that the good bowlers need to be studied well. “Whoever are impact bowlers in world cricket, you should be wary about their strengths but at the same time you should have that much self belief that you can score runs against any bowler. The result of the match will not be decided on mine or his (Aamir’s) performance alone.” And he doesn’t have to prove anything to anyone. “I don’t have to go out there and prove to the world that I have to win some kind of contest. I have never entertained these things till date and won’t do it near future. You can even get out to a part timer. I keep things that simple and basic.” He has had some memorable performances against Pakistan but talk about his 183 at Mirpur, he would be quick to point out others contribution. “If you talk about Mirpur, even Rohit batted very well and we had a lengthy stand. MS (Dhoni) and (Suresh) Raina then finished the game and at the start Sachin paaji (Tendulkar) played a great knock. It wasn’t as if I scored 330 out of 340 required. It’s good to create an external hoopla but we inside the change room know how to recognise each and every contribution.” He however accepted that it’s not fair to expect that fans would be very logical in their thought process. “I can’t tell fans to think in a particular manner. We have a professional approach to the game as we can’t get too emotional or over excited. So, mindset of the players will be different from that of fans. “Our attention span has to be very precise on field. We have that split second to make a decision but from a fans point of view I would say that it’s not easy to think like a player.” First Published: Jun 15, 2019 20:47 IST<end_of_turn>

# Rules and legal date of cannabis edibles in Ontario just announced

Rules and legal date of cannabis edibles in Ontario just announced  Cannabis edibles and extracts will be legal in Toronto right before the end of year, meaning you'll soon be able to get high off THC-infused treats.  Health Canada confirmed yesterday that you'll be able to buy edibles by mid-December, though the selection will be limited, at first.  Cannabis Regulations, the amended rules that will guide the production and sale of cannabis, its extracts, and topical ointments, officially comes into effect on October 17.  After that, any cannabis retail license holders will be required to give Health Canada a two-month notice before adding weed edibles to their stock.  That means that the earliest we could possibly be able to buy weed treats will be December 17, though that will be a stretch, given how late some retailers were in opening up shop in the first place.  Health Canada has also capped the amount of THC allowed in edibles at 10 mg, and 1,000 mg concentrates used for vape pens, and the same amount in cannabis topicals.  The Ontario Chamber of Commerce has released a statement saying that the amount of THC per package of edibles should be increased to 100 mg from 10 mg.  "The OCC supports a THC limit of 10-milligrams per discrete unit of edibles, as well as the sale of multi-packs or multiple products—up to a maximum of 100-milligrams of THC per package—within child-proof packaging," said the OCC statement.  "...single-packs are costly, while multi-packs would allow licensed producers to create economies of scale."  As for packaging, the rules remain stringent: nothing that would be appetizing to kids, and a mandatory warning message.  Cannabis-infused alcohol is also out of the question, which is probably why brewing companies like Molson and Moosehead have already announced they eventually plan to sell THC-infused beverages will be alcohol-free (though hopefully not in beer bottle look-alikes; that's illegal).  But until the cap on legal licensed retailers in the city moves up from 25, you'll only be able to purchased edibles in Toronto at the handful of legal stores in the city.

# Whyte: 'Gypsy bum' Tyson Fury should be ashamed of 'joke' fight against Schwarz

Dillian Whyte insists Tyson Fury should be ashamed of himself after crushing Tom Schwarz in a mismatch in Las Vegas.  Fury stopped Schwarz in the second round in a near punch-perfect display against a heavyweight quite clearly out of his depth.  Whyte has already called Fury out and slammed his rival for fighting Schwarz.  He said: ‘Can’t believe I stayed to watch that joke of a fight. Tyson Fury should be ashamed of (him)self running away from me and fighting these chumps. My mother would of [knocked out] Tom the bum in a round.’   Can’t believe I stayed to watch that joke of a fight @Tyson_Fury should be ashamed of self running away from me and fighting these chumps my mother would of Knockout Tom the bum in a round #GYPSYBUM #BUMCITY pic.twitter.com/ovwsr6OPhu  — Dillian Whyte (@DillianWhyte) June 16, 2019  Fury did say he would fight Whyte for the WBC ‘Silver’ belt, but quickly backtracked on the proposal.  The Gypsy King will fight again in September or October and is expected to take on another low-risk name.  Whyte, on the other hand, will continue to push for his showdown against Oscar Rivas to be for the mandatory position to Deontay Wilder’s WBC title.  While Whyte hit out, Fury consoled Schwarz backstage and made a classy promise to his fellow heavyweight.  ‘I want you to come to England and train with me as well,’ he said.  ‘I’ll try and get you on the card on my next fight. That’s a promise as well, I don’t say things I can’t back up.  ‘I’d like you to come and train with me. You’re going to come back better. Listen you fought the lineal heavyweight champion of the world, you’ll come back.’<end_of_turn>

# 'I'll always be there': Tight bond forged between cop and a bashed wife

As her husband sped through Melbourne's northern suburbs, threatening to crash the car and kill them both, Josline knew she couldn't just sit there. "If I stay in the car most likely I will die but if I jump out of the car there is a 50 per cent chance I will live," she thought. So Josline pushed open the door and jumped from the moving car. She hit the bitumen hard, suffered grazes to her knees and hurt her neck. But she lived. She was lying in a neck brace at the Northern Hospital when Detective Senior Constable Renee Prestia walked into the ward. The detective believed she was responding to a kidnapping and met a scared young woman with a limited grasp of English. With the help of an Arabic interpreter, Renee realised the man who had been behind the wheel of the car was Josline’s husband. "I specifically asked her: 'Did he do this to you?' And she replied: 'No, I am fine'," Renee says. "I told her: 'You don't look fine. Do you want to tell me what happened? Are you scared?' "She said: 'I'm not scared.'" But the physical wounds told a different story and with more than 10 years’ experience as a police officer, Renee suspected there was one perpetrator. Controlling, abusive and violent Josline met her husband in Lebanon. He was a handsome, well-groomed, well-dressed engineer with a penchant for luxury cars. His social media was filled with photos of him with an orange Lamborghini and a black BMW. She arrived in Melbourne a young, happy newlywed, and they soon had a little boy. But his home town became her nightmare, as she learnt he was controlling, abusive and violent. The abuse was daily. The threats against her life were daily. Josline didn’t always take the abuse silently – she did report it to police. Yet she would quickly withdraw her complaints because he told her he could easily pay someone $3000 and – she clicks her fingers at the memory – have her killed. In Lebanon, she says, family violence is seldom reported because it is accepted that a husband "has the right to do whatever he wants". Police had enough evidence to lay charges against Josline’s husband over the car ride, and arrested him as he walked into the hospital to visit her. With him in custody, Renee assured Josline she was safe and convinced her to make a statement. After she was discharged from hospital, Josline and Renee began talking. They discovered they both had sons of a similar age, and the bond between them strengthened. "I have a son who's six months older, so there was that definite connection and I thought that I just needed to help her," Renee says. Slowly, the softly-spoken Josline told Renee about her life in the grip of an abusive marriage to a volatile, erratic man. Every day in her marriage, Jocelyn woke up expecting to be struck. "I thought I was living in a jail," she says. She was regularly assaulted, whipped with electrical cabling and felt her mind was being controlled. One day he threatened he would "break your back and turn you into a disabled person in a wheelchair" so she could never play with her young son. When her application for welfare payments was refused by Centrelink, he bashed her with a metal object. In May 2016 she was in his BMW and as he tore around and said: "I swear by Allah’s name I will burn the damn car and we will die today." After Josline jumped, her husband took her to the hospital and told staff that strangers had kidnapped his wife. Hospital staff, doubting his story, called police. Two months after giving her initial statement, Josline told Renee her husband had raped her. "This is the beginning and I will dump you like a dog,” he said. 'Are you happy like this?' To this day, Renee meets people through her policing work who believe there is no such thing as rape in a marriage. Recalling the abuse at times took its emotional toll on Josline, and extricating herself from a marriage and the father of her son was complicated. But such was the bond between the women by that point that Renee knew when to tread carefully, and when to call her out. "Why do you protect him?" she asked at one point. "Are you happy like this?" Early on in her investigation, Renee discovered Josline was not the first woman who had suffered at the hands of her husband. In 2011 he was jailed for 22 months for beating his first wife with her shoes and whipping her with a television cable. The couple's two children were on the other side of a locked door, screaming so hard one of them began vomiting. Ultimately, it was her son who spurred Josline on. Nearly a year before the terrifying ordeal in the car, her husband moved their son to Lebanon to live with his father's family. Josline and her little boy had been separated for 15 months. "When they took him away I said 'I must do something about this'," Josline recalls. Learning of this development was one of the reasons why Renee became so heavily invested. "That started getting my emotions going," she says. On top of spearheading the family violence investigation, the detective found a women's legal service that specialises in international disputes and the Family Court became involved. "We probably forced those people to bring him back," Renee says. Josline expresses a quiet relief at having her boy, now four, back home, sleeping beside her at night. Josline was relieved, she says now, to "let out what I'd kept for three years". Last year, Josline gave evidence against her former husband at trial, he was found guilty and in March the 45-year-old was jailed for eight years for rape and assault. County Court judge Julie Condon said the man’s "shocking pattern of behaviour" had subjected his then wife to a litany of emotional and physical abuse that had degraded and humiliated her, and left her with lasting pain through her body. "You brutalised her with your cowardly assaults," the judge told the 45-year-old. She jailed him for eight years, to serve at least six before being eligible for parole. Josline suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, frequent bouts of depression and chronic physical pain from the brutal assaults. She remains hyper-vigilant, has had countless nightmares and constantly feels she is being followed. But she is out of harm’s way. Renee's investigative abilities and dedication – which included driving Josline home after each statement, arranging a safe house and advising on what to expect in court – didn't go unnoticed. Last year, she won the Mick Miller detective of the year award, named in honour of Victoria Police's former chief commissioner. "The Brownlow for detectives" is how one of Renee's colleagues describes the accolade. "Sometimes you feel like you're not making a difference whatsoever, but in cases like this it's a good feeling," Renee says. The detective now works with the specialist Broadmeadows family violence investigation unit and her involvement with Josline has changed the way she works with other victims. Every year Victoria Police responds to 79,000 family violence incidents, and Domestic Violence Victoria says one in three Australian women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15. One in five have experienced sexual violence. There is limited data on how prevalent family violence is in migrant and refugee communities. One support service, inTouch Multicultural Centre Against Family Violence, last year worked with 1400 women in Victoria. Josline believes family violence is becoming less tolerated in her community. Since her case finished she saw a man hit his partner, so encouraged the woman to contact police. Renee quickly assumes the role of protector when the women meet again in Broadmeadows police station, but they both say they drew strength from each other and now consider themselves friends. "Without a doubt, Josline and I will be friends for a very long time, and she knows that I will always be there for her and her son," Renee says. Seated next to the detective, Josline tells her: "You are the best because you give me a big chance to live." For help in a crisis call 000.

# Demonstrators block Iran embassy’s entrance in London: envoy

Demonstrators block Iran embassy’s entrance in London: envoy  TEHRAN – Iranian Ambassador to the UK Hamid Baeidinejad said on Sunday that a group of demonstrators protesting outside the embassy had blocked the entrance to the building. “A few demonstrators continue to block today sole entrance of Iran’s Embassy in London and prevented the diplomats to enter into the building,” Baeidinejad said in a tweet. “Saturdays and Sundays are working days in Iran and diplomatic staff arrange some parts of their work with their capital in these two days.”  In another tweet, Baeidinejad said, “Entrance and the pavement are the essential parts of the Iran Embassy building and needs to be cleared of persons and media to ensure security and peace of mind for diplomats entering the Embassy. Civil protest should be organized at other side of street under Police supervision.”  It came a day after the husband of a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran announced that she has begun a new hunger strike to protest against her detention.  Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, has been imprisoned in Iran for more than years on charges of trying to orchestrate a soft overthrow of the Islamic Republic.  MH/PA<end_of_turn>

The option for the payment of the balance of the dividend in shares was chosen by EDF's shareholders: 93.71% of the rights were exercised in favor of a payment in shares following the option period which took place between 24 May 2019 and 10 June 2019 included. In accordance with article L.232-18 of the French commercial Code and with article 25 of the Articles of Association, EDF's General Shareholders' Meeting of 16 May 2019 decided to pay a dividend in respect of the 2018 financial year for an amount of €0.31 per share conferring entitlement to the ordinary dividend, with an option for the payment in shares of the Company of the outstanding balance of the dividend still to be paid, amounting to 0.16 euro per share conferring entitlement to the ordinary dividend. The issue price of the new shares is €11.10 per share, equal to 90% of the average of the opening prices of the EDF shares listed on the Euronext Paris market over the twenty trading days prior to 16 May 2019, date of the Combined Shareholders' Meeting, less the amount of the balance of the dividend, rounded up to the next highest euro cent. This transaction will result in the issuance of 40,701,950 new shares (representing approximately 1.33% of the share capital, taking into account the issuance), to be delivered and admitted for trading on Euronext Paris starting on 18 June 2019.

# Crystal Palace may demand Man Utd wipe off Zaha sell-on fee as part of Wan-Bissaka transfer deal

CRYSTAL PALACE are reportedly demanding Manchester United wipe off their Wilfred Zaha sell-on fee as part of an Aaron Wan-Bissaka transfer deal.  United signed winger Zaha for £15million in 2013 but sold him back to Palace two-years later for just £6m - though the deal included a clause that means the Reds receive a sizeable percentage of any future sell.  The Ivorian has attracted much interest this summer with the player admitting he is open to leaving Selhurst Park and could fetch up to £80m.  Another Palace player set to leave London is right-back Wan-Bissaka - with United seeing an opening bid of £40m rejected. Palace are demanding upwards of £60m for the England U-21 star and The Guardian report Selhurst chiefs are considering using the transfer to cancel United’s Zaha sell-on fee.  With the threat of United pocketing a percentage of Zaha’s transfer, Palace are wanting to see Old Trafford chiefs terminate their sell-on clause.  It would mean Wan-Bissaka will arrive for a lesser fee and allow Palace to bank all of the Zaha sale.  With Palace holding out for £60m, removing the Zaha sell-on fee could effectively see United save £10m. Most Read Manchester United Transfer News The two clubs are set to hold talks over the weekend with Wan-Bissaka already informing Palace bosses he wants a dream move to Old Trafford.  United have long struggled to fill the void at right-back with 33-year-old winger Ashley Young forced to play there last season as club captain Antonio Valencia was frozen out the line up.  SunSport revealed Old Trafford chiefs have scouted the Palace star several times this season and braced themselves for a summer move for the 21-year-old.<end_of_turn>

# How the internet is affecting the human brain

How the internet is affecting the human brain: Multitasking and relying on Google to jog our memories is impacting on our concentration and social skills Researchers from UK, U.S. and Australia looked at how internet affects the brain Found that constantly flicking between items online reduces ability to focus Also revealed people memorise less and rely on internet to find out information Spending time on the internet is reducing our ability to focus on one task at a time - and it means we no longer store facts in our brains. Our lives have been forever changed by gaining access to infinite amounts of information at the touch of a button, but the way our head works has too. A new review looking into the effect of the online world on our brain functions from researchers in the UK, US and Australia, has drawn a number of surprising conclusions. The review focused on the world wide web's influence in three areas: attention spans, memory, and social cognition. It notes that the internet is now 'unavoidable, ubiquitous, and a highly functional aspect of modern living' before diving into how it has changed our society. Scroll down for video A new review looking into the effect of the online world on our brain has found that spending time multitasking on the internet is reducing the ability to focus on one task (file photo) Professor Jerome Sarris, an author on the paper, told Medical News Today the online world could have far reaching consequences. He said: 'The bombardment of stimuli via the internet, and the resultant divided attention commonly experienced, presents a range of concerns. 'I believe that this, along with the increasing #Instagramification of society, has the ability to alter both the structure and functioning of the brain, while potentially also altering our social fabric.' The review found that people who regularly multitask online, by checking different social media sites such as Facebook or streaming entertainment, struggle to focus on a single task. Constant use of the internet, via our smartphones or laptops, means that many of us have developed 'checking' behaviours - where the user looks at their phone regularly, but only for short periods of time. Joseph Firth, another author of the review, told Medical News Today: 'The limitless stream of prompts and notifications from the internet encourages us towards constantly holding a divided attention ⁠— which then, in turn, may decrease our capacity for maintaining concentration on a single task.' Constant use of the internet, via our smartphones or laptops, means that many of us have developed 'checking' behaviours - where the user looks at their phone regularly, but only for short periods of time (file photo) Another aspect dealt with in the review is memory, and our reliance on the internet for information. People are less and less likely memorise information - in fact, one study found people are more likely to know where certain details could be found online, rather than the content itself. Although this means people are more reliant on the internet, it has been suggested that this could help 'free up' brain power that could be used on more 'ambitious undertakings than previously possible'. Finally, the review examined the differences between online and offline social interaction. Although social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram mean people interact with more users, friendship groups have stayed roughly the same size. These five hierarchical layers - primary partners, intimate relationships, best friends, close friends, and all friends - range from 1 to 150 in size, but appear to be the same online and offline. The review notes: 'Given the evidence above, an appropriate metaphor for the relationship between online and real‐world sociality could be a "new playing field for the same game".' However, where the two differ can cause problems - acceptance and rejection can be quantified in 'friends' or 'followers', rather than staying ambiguous. It also showcases 'hyper-successful individuals' that can create unrealistic expectations, particularly for younger people. Although the internet can have negative impacts on the young, older people can benefit, as it can help with social interaction. The full findings of the study were published in the journal World Psychiatry,<end_of_turn>

# Death penalty: Does it really deter Rape

In any civilized society the demand for justice has to be heard and the culprits need to be punished        In 2012, Nirbhaya rape case instigated thousands Indians to protest the widespread culture of rape and violence against women in Delhi. Recognizing the public anger, the government of India in 2013 passed an ordinance prescribing death penalty for those guilty of raping children under the age of 12. The criminal law amendment ordinance, which later became The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 (Nirbhaya Act), amended the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Evidence Act, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and POCSO Act to introduce a new provision to sentence convicts of such crimes to death. However, the most significant and pertinent question still remain unanswered; does the possibility of death penalty really deter people in indulging rape (the most celebrated argument in favor of it)? Can capital punishment be a philosophically, legally and socially tenable idea?  Despite of legal possibility of death penalty for rape, almost five years later in Kathua, a rape case of a minor girl surfaced and shocked the Indian masses again. The poor tribal girl was repeatedly raped and finally murdered. Likewise, recently, a case of rape (however yet to be confirmed), torture and murder of a toddler girl in Tappal, Aligarh has been registered on 2nd of June. The whole nation is in great grief and anger. Peoples of the country are rightly agitated and outraged. People from all corner of the nation are demanding a death penalty for rapists.  Truly, as in any civilized society the demand for justice has to be heard and the culprits need to be punished. But, are we merely concerned about the quantum of punishment or do we really want to solve the problem per se? Indeed such painful incidents raise many serious questions about nation’s socio-political culture, legal frame work and police functioning and their relationship with crime.  In fact, all crimes have a socio-cultural, economical, legal and political account which is subject to the social structure, cultural framework of the society and legal character of the state. It is the state and society which induce democratic and liberal humanistic values among its members and shape their conceptual framework about other fellow human beings. A hegemonic understanding of ‘others’ leads people to take advantages of disadvantaged resulting in crimes. Likewise, rape crimes are also a result of similar dominating socio-culture understanding of women. In this regard, Madumita Pandey’s (PhD student at the Criminology Department of Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom) interview with 100 rapists provides a very realistic and eye opening picture. She finds out that “what they (rapists) have done is because of upbringing and thought process”. In India most of the men consider women as a sex object, devoid of sexual choices and rights. In such scenario, it becomes very important to understand incident of rapes and rapist from a socio-cultural perspective and then decide the quantum of punishment accordingly.  Secondly, while a large portion of the society does not access the primary education forget about the secondary and higher level of education, and not to mention the quality. India is placed at a low bottom at the UN hunger index table. The unemployment among the youth is very high in the society. Now, can we really put all the blame upon the rapist alone? Undoubtedly, the accused are the immediate culprits in the cases of rape and should be punished for their unpardonable act. However, are state and society not the real and indirect culprits? It is the duty of the state and society to prepare good citizens through various necessary measures. And if there are crimes in the society, the society and state cannot be absolved of all responsibility.  In fact, state need to provide an adequate security system to its vulnerable citizens like women but often it doesn’t. Likewise, society needs to inculcate egalitarian gender neutral values among its members but Indian society has failed to do the same. Therefore, at the first place, state should be forced to take the responsibility of its failure to protect woman’s dignity and life. Indeed, almost all the crime cases in general and rape cases in particular are the result of a failed state and society.  Now, under the light of above discussion, we are in a position to investigate the second dimension of the problem that is; quantum of punishment.  First of all, demand for capital punishment for any crime including rape is not sustainable as it is not rational and against the fundamental human rights principle. Also it defies the purpose of punishment. Laws cannot be formed on the basis of vengeance and emotions. As law cannot be the reflection of collective will they should be built up rationally, untainted by emotion. They should be categorical imperative – that is what Immanuel Kant’s ‘duty for duty sake’ principle declares.  Secondly, criminals are not born they are the product of adverse social, cultural, economical and political conditions. Since objective of the law is not to eliminate the culprit but to eliminate crime from the society, the criminal should be reformed and not eliminated.  If the argument is that the criminals are punished to tame the society, to deter others from doing same in future then provision of capital punishment is turned against the law of natural justice. It is unethical to use a person as a means of deterrence to other humans and hence the demand for capital punishment is morally unacceptable. Secondly, it is debatable to say that infliction of death penalty has been deterred people from doing concerned crime.  Fourthly, infliction of death penalty is in itself barbaric, brutal and fundamentalist way of punishment. Two wrongs do not make a right. Capital punishment itself is a form of violence against humanity and violence is condemnable at every level. Thus, capital punishment cannot be a rational and justified legal policy.  Finally, our judicial system has great lacunas. Fair justice is not available to all sections of the society at equal cost. Moreover, death penalty for rape could compel the rapists to murder the victim as that may be a better chance of escape. Therefore, demand of capital punishment for rape is impractical, unethical and against the demand of natural justice.  In fact, problem of rape need to be tackled from the socio-cultural and legal point of view. Simply playing with the rhetoric and polemics will not work. It is high time government and the society to wake up. It is high time for the government to take responsibility of their failure and take the corrective measures at the grassroots level.  It is the duty of the society as well to join hands together and force the government to accomplish its prime duty of good governance in an effective manner. Within an educated, enlightened and cultured society only, the rights of marginalized, weaker and vulnerable section of the society can be protected. This may be the only way possible to stop heinous crimes such as rape. Otherwise we have to just wait for another rape and moron after that.

# Hong Kong leader apologisesas massive rally chokes city

HONG KONG: Hundreds of thousands of protesters choked Hong Kong’s streets for a second straight Sunday in a defiant rebuke of a reviled extradition law, piling pressure on the city’s embattled pro-Beijing leader who apologised for causing “conflict” but refused to step down. The show of force saw huge crowds marching for hours in tropical heat, calling for the resignation of chief executive Carrie Lam, who was forced to suspend the bill as public anger mounted. Throngs of black-clad protesters snaked their way for miles through the streets to the city’s parliament — a repeat of a record-breaking demonstration last Sunday that organisers said more than a million people attended. As night fell the huge crowds had once more taken over multiple major thoroughfares, including outside the legislature, with the police seemingly ceding the streets to the jubilant masses. Critics fear the Beijing-backed law will entangle people in China’s notoriously opaque and politicised courts and damage the city’s reputation as a safe business hub. Lam’s office put out a statement late Sunday admitting that shortcomings in how her administration handled the law had “led to a lot of conflict and disputes” and “disappointed and distressed many citizens”. “The chief executive apologises to the citizens and promises to accept criticism with the most sincere and humble attitude,” it said. It came a day after she announced she would postpone the law indefinitely. Still, Sunday’s statement fell well short of demands that she resign, shelve the bill permanently and apologise for police using tear gas and rubber bullets earlier in the week. “Hong Kong people feel that she’s not sincere and continues to be extremely arrogant,” political analyst Dixon Sing told AFP. “I don’t think the anger will subside.”The international finance hub was rocked Wednesday by the worst political violence in decades as protesters were dispersed by baton-wielding riot police. Many accused the police of using excessive force and anger was further fanned by authorities calling the largely young protesters “rioters”. Nearly 80 people were injured in the unrest — including 22 police officers — with both sides showing a willingness to escalate action and reaction to levels unseen in the usually stable business hub. One man died late Saturday when he fell from a building where he had been holding an hours-long anti-extradition protest. He had unfurled a banner on scaffolding attached to an upscale mall, but fell when rescuers tried to haul him in.<end_of_turn>

# The beaches suburb about to change the most

The northern beaches suburb that will see the most change in the shortest time is Frenchs Forest. New roads are coming out of the ground, a new town centre is planned and a new high school is due to be built near the Aquatic Centre. Rezonings around the Northern Beaches Hospital are due this year, although previous rezoning release dates have been missed. Matt Brady, of Belle Property Seaforth, said Frenchs Forest will be a totally different suburb in five to 10 years time. “I think Frenchs Forest is a hidden secret,” he said. “The new roads are starting to come together, access from Aquatic Drive to Wakehurst Parkway is shaving time off journeys and the Glenrose Shopping Centre has a vibe about it that it didn’t have,” he said. Davidson MP Jonathan O’Dea has said the Liberal State government will deliver an east-west B-Line bus service from Dee Why to Chatswood. Mr Brady said a turn up and go bus service linking Frenchs Forest to Chatswood and trains to the city will make a big impact on people living in Frenchs Forest. “Families who earlier discounted Frenchs Forest as being too far from the city will reconsider,” he said. “A B-Line bus service will change the landscape in Frenchs Forest.” According to CoreLogic there have been 225 house sales in 12 months in Frenchs Forest to March of this year. The median house price is $1.4 million which is 12.6 per cent down on a year. One family home that is getting a lot of views from young families and people downsizing is 3 The Ridge, Frenchs Forest. This three-bedroom, two bathroom house is on 696sqm of land in a cul-de-sac a short walk to parkland, public transport and Wakehurst Primary School. The mid 1970s house that has been renovated and extended goes to auction on Saturday June 29 and has a bidding guide of $1.3 million. The house is elevated with leafy views and a northeast aspect. There is a front balcony with motorised awning and two outdoor areas to sit and eat, plus a rear lawn. The gas kitchen has a modern island bench and stainless steel appliances. Each of the bedrooms have built-ins and the main bedroom has its own bathroom. The double garage has room for a workshop. One of the more affordable homes for sale in Frenchs Forest is 45 Adams St, a three-bedroom single storey house with an asking price of $1.2 million to $1.3 million. And one of the more exclusive homes is 38 Epping Dr, a five-bedroom, four-bathroom house with pool with a price range of $1.975 million to $2.05 million. There are also three houses in one crescent up for grabs, numbers 4, 6 and 18 Holland Cres are all for sale and are in a crescent adjoining the Forest High School and the planned new town centre.

# David Beckham labelled ‘creepy’ for kissing Harper on lips

DAVID Beckham got into trouble with his lips again! It seems like he never learned his lesson the first time round. He was photographed kissing Harper, aged 7, on the lips during a Father’s Day weekend in Spain with the whole family. The family was in a restaurant in Seville for a family dinner when the offending smooch happened. The famous footballer came under fire for kissing his daughter on the lips before in November and this time round, newsman Piers Morgan labelled it “weird”. “Why would a father kiss his daughter on the lips? Don’t get it. Creepy. Weird. Creepy.” Becks has defended himself before saying he kisses all of his kids on the lips. “Brooklyn maybe not. Brooklyn’s 18, he might find that a little bit strange. “But I’m very affectionate with the kids. It’s how I was brought up and Victoria, and it’s how we are with our children. “We want to show our kids love and we protect them, look after them, and support them, and we’re very affectionate with them.” While the affections shown may be a turn off for some, Becks is not alone. The other celebrities that have been criticized for kissing their children on the lips include Olivia Wilde, Hilary Duff and Justin Timberlake.<end_of_turn>

# A UC Davis junior, radio host and activist died 25 years ago. Now, he is a graduate

UC Davis student receives posthumous degrees 25 years after his death  At 21, Oscar Gomez Jr. was “desarrollando – blossoming,” in the words of Eddie Salas, a close friend and Davis community member.  A member of the UC Davis chapter of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán (MEChA) and the host of radio show “La Onda Xicana,” Gomez was known and loved on UC campuses, in state penitentiaries, on fields worked by Chicanx farmers and in his hometown of Baldwin Park – anywhere the airwaves carried his voice on KDVS 90.3 FM, anywhere he had traveled to orally document the struggles of Chicanx people.  Friends described a magnetism that drew people toward him and each other, making community coalesce. “He was glue, binding all of us,” said Juan Gonzalez, a lifelong friend and fellow MEChA member.  His premature death on Nov. 6, 1994, left family, friends, fellow organizers and fans of his radio show bereft. “They held vigils in the state penitentiaries when he passed away,” Gonzalez said.  Last Friday, 25 years later, Gomez was finally awarded a posthumous degree in Chicana/o Studies and Community Development at the Chicanx and Latinx Graduation Celebration of 2019. (Chicanx and Latinx are gender-neutral alternatives to Chicano and Latino.)  His father, Oscar Gomez Sr., a former firefighter who, according to friends of Gomez’s, imparted his expansive warmth and intent manner of listening to his son, was there to accept the degree on his behalf.  Friends and family in the bleachers, reunited at UC Davis after decades dispersed across California, stood with a collective roar of “Que viva Oscar,” cameras raised high.  Oscar Gomez Sr. was accompanied by his second son, Eduardo Gomez, who draped his brother’s shawl over his shoulders: “Oscar E. Gomez Jr. El Bandido. UC Davis MEChA. Class of 1995.”  El Bandido de Aztlán  Every Sunday morning between 1991 and 1994, students, activists, farmworkers and prison inmates tuned into KDVS 90.3 FM to catch Gomez’s voice.  Gomez – alias El Bandido de Aztlán – mixed Chicano soul oldies with talk of art, people’s history, and present-day political challenges and objectives. In a recording, his Spanglish drawl is relaxed and assured, improvisational but deeply researched. “Para toda la gente ahi de los barrios ahi de Sacramento y Yolo ... We’re gonna be here ... talking little bit more of the lucha and the spirit of the juventud. ... Llamada: 752-2777 ahora lo puedes.”  His alias, El Bandido, was a reference to famous 19th-century vaquero and outlaw Joaquin Murrieta Carrillo, according to The LAist – “sort of like Robin Hood,” said Susy Zepeda, professor of Chicana/o studies at UC Davis. “He was naming an indigenous self – but a complicated one, with an anti-colonial and anti-imperial view.”  “La Onda Xicana,” inspired by grassroots radio of the 1960s, snagged listeners with sweet tunes, then engaged them with their histories and communities. As peers organized against the anti-affirmative action Proposition 209, the anti-immigrant Proposition 187 and the politics of Gov. Pete Wilson, Gomez pulled greater numbers into the struggle.  “Oscar politicized me,” Sharon Torres, a local activist, said.  Fellow organizers joined him in the studio. And he joined them in the field, microphone and recording equipment in hand — extensions of his persistent desire to hold dialogue. He pastiched his field recordings – from farms, schools, prisons and university protests – into “La Onda Xicana.”  “He opened doors for anyone with a cause to talk,” fellow DJ Rafael Chávez said. “He picked up calls from LA, Yolo County, Santa Barbara – anywhere there was a university he had a connection.”  His public engagement connected activist scholarship to working-class people, Chávez said.  “He had an innate ability to engage. I don’t care if you were the mayor or you were the homeless,” said Salas. “He could make you feel like you were the most important person in the world. Everybody gravitated towards him.”  The Sunday after Nov. 16, 1994, however, there was radio silence from Gomez. He had died in what the police ruled an accident while covering a student protest against a controversial hire at UC Santa Barbara.  Gomez’s family and friends, roused to action by a coroner’s report of head trauma, called for a reopening of the case under the slogan “Justicia Para Oscar” – to no avail.  His death was deeply felt across multiple communities. “They held vigils in the state penitentiaries when he passed away,” Gonzalez said.  Twenty-five years later, his posthumous degree is “long overdue,” several friends – Gonzalez, Salas and childhood friend Israel Calderon – said on separate occasions.  Zepeda, who spearheaded the awarding of the posthumous degree, said it was about “humanizing and remembering” Gomez. “We have to look at our genealogy and … see the lessons of it.”  For Gonzalez, the degree constituted deliverance: “When I got that call from the university, I was bawling. I felt like the chains were released. I could breathe. I could move on.”  Oscar Gomez Sr. said he valued not so much the degree itself as the recognition it signified. “He was being recognized for his work,” he said. “That meant a lot to me.”  But the closure was only partial. For Gonzalez, questions about the circumstances of his death persisted. Salas expressed skepticism toward a university that declined to investigate Gomez’s death only to celebrate a much-dimmed legacy 25 years later. Others felt a bittersweet mixture of relief and renewed grief.  “Now I have a degree, but I have no son,” Gomez’s mother Maria said.  From Baldwin Park to UC Davis  Gomez was born in 1973 in Baldwin Park in Los Angeles County, the eldest of Oscar and Maria Gomez’s four children. Always tall for his age, he was known as a “gentle giant” and “big teddy bear,” his school friends said. Jose Armendariz recalled defending Gomez until Gomez became a defender himself: He shielded vulnerable kids from school bullies on the playground and played linebacker on the football field.  High school graduation photos depict him beaming, broad-shouldered and genial. He had been accepted into UC Davis as a scholar-athlete.  While the boys congregated in the school gym after the handing out of diplomas, they found Gomez sporting a pair of sunglasses, Calderon recounted. “Why are you wearing your shades inside?” they asked him.  “Because the future is bright,” Gomez said.  The boys cracked up.  Gomez entered the 18,000-strong UC Davis student body as one of only 800 Chicanx and Latinx students, according to Margarita Berta-Avila, a fellow UC Davis student and organizer.  Judith Segura-Mora was representing MEChA at a welcome bazaar for Chicanx and Latinx students when Gomez approached her. She clocked him as a jock and directed him wryly towards the party table. MEChA was for hard workers who wanted to make a difference, she told him.  But Gomez’s interest was piqued. At the next MEChA meeting, Gomez was there. Then, when he commandeered a university golf cart and was sentenced to community service, he chose to do his time by hosting a show on the university radio station, KDVS.  The rest was history. Friends attested to Gomez’s rapid blossoming, thirst for knowledge and youthful wisdom. “He was in so many places at once, and resided in so many minds and hearts, and yet was solid, so solid,” said Natalie Paredes. “He loved people so much.”  Re-creating ‘La Onda Xicana’ in Woodland  The emotions that the graduation elicited found release the next day at an intimate gathering of about 30 community members at Taller Arte del Nuevo Amanecer, a warehouse art space run by UC Davis’ Chicana/o Studies Department.  After Calpulli Tlayolotl, a Mexican group, performed an opening prayer, family and friends reminisced amid silkscreen-printed protest art, including work by Malaquías Montoya, a UC Davis professor and one of Gomez’s mentors.  Segura-Mora played a slideshow of images set to the soundtrack of “Young, Gifted, and Brown,” specially re-recorded by Joe Bataan himself. “On a rainy Sunday morning in 1973 / A mother was blessed with a son who grew up to be/ Young, gifted, and brown/ With the strength to tear a mountain down/ With a voice so young and clear/ A chance for everyone to hear.”  The music that Gomez loved filled the space, recreating “La Onda Xicana.”  “It seems like Oscar is still alive because so many people are still doing things for him,” Oscar Gomez Sr. said. “There’s always something – every year a scholarship, a documentary.”  In fact, several Oscars live on: Four of his friends and siblings named their children after him. Two were present at the gathering.  Several of his friends have gone on to work in education, a field that Gomez considered paramount. Calderon teaches at his and Gomez’s alma mater, Baldwin Park High School. Paredes is a community college counselor. Salas still works with high-risk youth. Gladys Gomez, his younger sister, is a teacher. And Almendariz, who didn’t go to college, recently received his teaching certification.  Armendariz, Calderon, Gonzalez and Gladys Gomez, alongside a few other close friends, are board members of LUCHA Foundation, which provides higher education scholarships to first-generation low-income students.  Salas, taking the mic at the gathering, recited a Toltec fragment in the spirit of life lived brilliantly: “Our lives are shorter than flowers. Then shall we mourn? No. We shall dance and dress in bright colors – because our lives are shorter than flowers.”<end_of_turn>

# Number of African migrants arriving at U.S. border to soar

U.S. Customs and Border Control agents anticipate an increase in migrants from central African countries after more than 500 people from Angola, Cameroon, and the Republic of Congo — including one group of 116 — were arrested at the Del Rio, Texas, border in the last month, according to the BBC.  The influx of hundreds of African migrants have made it difficult for agents to carry out asylum processes due to the language and cultural barriers. Local San Antonio news reporter, Jaleesa Irizarry, tweeted the city was in search of French-speaking volunteers and mentioned more migrants were expected to arrive in the following days.  "Our Border Patrol agents are facing more unique challenges every day as the number of family units from different regions of the world continue to increase,” Del Rio Sector acting Chief Patrol Agent Randy Davis said in a statement.  The number of African migrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border considerably exceeds last year’s reports. In 2018 fiscal year, agents arrested a total of 45 Eritreans and 33 Somalians, but none from Angola or the Republic of Congo, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.  How the migrants reached the southern border is still unclear. According to the BBC, some have traveled to Brazil first before making their way up north through Colombia and then Central America, a journey that could take several months.<end_of_turn>

# WC SAPS probe botched anti-gang unit operation

WC SAPS probe botched anti-gang unit operation  The officers attached to the anti-gang unit were shot and wounded in a failed operation in Samora Machel last week.  CAPE TOWN - Police in the Western Cape are investigating a botched operation in which six officers were hurt. The officers attached to the anti-gang unit were shot and wounded in a failed operation in Samora Machel last week. In an explosive letter to police bosses, unit head Andre Lincoln claimed he was not aware of the operation. Lincoln told provincial police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula he wanted three officials removed from the group. In a letter to Jula, he said the three high-ranking members, who sanctioned the failed operation, were not even present when the raid was executed. Lincoln said he knew nothing of the raid and added it was approved without adequate planning. The operation was under investigation.  Timeline

# Oppn parties to huddle before taking call on attending PM's simultaneous poll meet

Opposition parties, including the Congress, which are opposed to holding of simultaneous elections to Parliament and state assemblies, will take a call on Wednesday morning whether to attend a meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the 'one nation, one election' issue. Leaders of UPA constituents, who met in Parliament on Tuesday evening, discussed the issue and decided that they would hold further discussions with other like-minded parties before taking a final call on the matter.  Rahul evaded questions on the issue when posed to him after the meeting in Parliament. Modi has invited the heads of all the political parties that have at least one member either in the Lok Sabha or in the Rajya Sabha to discuss the issue. Leaders of UPA constituents, including T R Balu and Kanimozi of DMK, Farooq Abdullah of National Conference, NCP leader Supriya Sule and P K Kunhali Kutty of IUML, attended Tuesday's meeting in Parliament. Both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were present at the meeting, besides CPI's D Raja and N K Premchandran of RSP. Opposition parties are weary of the meeting convened by the prime minister as they feel this might be a "trap" set by the BJP and needs proper discussion before going ahead, sources said. Many opposition parties are yet to decide on whether to attend the meeting, while some party chief like Mamata Banerjee of TMC, M K Stalin of DMK and TRS' K Chandrasekhar Rao have already announced their decision of not attending the meeting convened by the prime minister. Banerjee excused herself and asked the Centre to prepare a white paper on the issue, instead of doing it "hurriedly". "A proper response on such a sensitive and serious subject like 'one country, one election' in such a short time would not do justice to the subject. The matter requires consultations with constitutional experts, election experts and above all, the party members," she said in a letter to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi. The agenda for the meeting also include celebration of 75 years of Independence in 2022 and the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi this year. It will be followed by a dinner-meeting with all the MPs on June 20. (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)<end_of_turn>

# Joe Budden & Cyn Santana May Have Staged Break-Up For "Love & Hip Hop"

Could they actually still be together? There have been several conflicting reports about Joe Budden and Cyn Santana's break-up. The two were set to be married but they seemingly called off their engagement for an unknown reason after rumours of Joe's infidelity started swirling around. The Love & Hip-Hop couple upset a lot of fans by failing to explain why they went their separate ways but now, it's being reported that they might actually be secretly staging this for the show's ratings. Thaddaeus McAdams/Getty Images Thaddaeus McAdams/Getty Images As reported by All Hip Hop, Joe Budden went on Instagram Live recently to praise Mona Scott-Young, the producer of LHH. "Y'all know Mona's a genius... don't sleep," said the former rapper before admitting that he might get in trouble and signing off. While he doesn't necessarily make mention to his relationship with Cyn Santana, many are assuming that his Mona Scott reference means that she could have been the mastermind behind the split. It's likely that on the next season of the show, Joe and Cyn's engagement and break-up will be a major plot point, perhaps ending with their reconciliation. To be completely honest, we can't say we didn't see that coming. It hasn't been confirmed that the split was planned but that's simply the word around town. We hope that Joe and Cyn can make it work and if they are indeed done as a duo, we wish them the best.<end_of_turn>

# Amid US-Cuba Tensions, Cimafunk Bridges a Cultural Divide

“The Cuban James Brown has arrived” read the headline of Colombia’s top newspaper, El Tiempo. It was February 18, 2019, and Cuba’s new musical sensation, known as Cimafunk, had landed in Bogotá with his band for their first performance outside of their homeland—as well as to secure visas for their upcoming tour of the United States. Deteriorating diplomatic relations between the Trump administration and Cuba led to a closure of the US consular section in Havana in the fall of 2017; Cimafunk and his entire band were forced to apply at the US consulate in Bogotá. Both the concert in Colombia’s capital and the visa appointment represented important steps in Cimafunk’s ascent as the next major Cuban star on the international stage of music. Billboard has described Cimafunk as “Cuba’s 2018 revelation of the year.” The New Yorker has cited his “uncanny ability to control the energy in the room.” Argentina’s leading rock-and-roll pianist, Fito Paez, calls Cimafunk “one of the lights of the future of the continent.” As US-Cuba relations sink to new lows with Trump’s imposition of severe travel restrictions to the island, the cultural bridge that Cimafunk’s music could build across the Florida straits has become all the needed, urgent, and meaningful. Fortunately, in Bogotá, US visas were granted to all eight members of the band, which includes three percussionists and a young female trumpeter. Before flying to the United States, they took the stage at Armando’s Records with a set filled with homages to traditional Afro-Cuban music, but fused with sounds reminiscent of James Brown. In the United States, the band’s first stop was South by Southwest, the make-or-break music festival in Austin, Texas, where new, edgy, international bands are discovered. The stage was set on February in a large ballroom where three sparsely attended performances by other bands had been held earlier that day. For SXSW, it seemed just another gig by a little-known band from Cuba. But the moment Cimafunk began to play, that “uncanny ability” to control the energy in the room became apparent. By the second song, the room was packed; some people headed for the hallway to grab passersbys, tugging them into the pulsating ballroom with the admonition: “You have to see this!” Cimafunk “fired up crowds” with “impeccable showmanship plus next-level musicianship” reported the music critic for the local Austin-American Statesman. The review predicted that the band would “rise to international stardom.” To understand what Cubans call the fenomeno Cimafunk, it’s helpful to understand who Cimafunk is. Cimafunk is actually the nom de guerre of Erik Iglesias Rodriguez, an artist who hit the contemporary Cuban music scene last year. Since then, he has led his own musical revolution on the island.  Iglesias was born some 30 years ago in the western region of rural, tobacco-rich Pinar del Rio and displayed an early affinity for music, singing in church. He remembers draining the battery of his uncle’s car listening to the music of James Brown, George Clinton, and Michael Jackson on a cassette player all night long. As a teenager, he flirted with Afro-Cuban beats, Cuban trova, and even modern reggaeton. Singing with his high-school friends, he eventually established his own sound—a mix of all those rhythms. Initially, Iglesias intended to pursue a career as a doctor. But in 2010, after his third year in medical school, he dropped out and headed to Havana to see how far his sound could take him. Cuba’s complicated history of colonization, slavery, immigration, proximity to the United States, and revolution have created a musical incubator unlike anywhere else in the world. Combining musical traditions is a tradition itself, as reflected in the sounds of groups like Yerba Buena and Interactivo, the band Iglesias sang for when he first arrived in Havana. Inspired by his time with Interactivo, Iglesias decided to forge his own path and continue a Cuban tradition of fusing sounds, objects, histories, and peoples together. He founded Cimafunk in 2017. The name is drawn from cimarrones—the Spanish term for former African slaves in Latin America who escaped enslavement and founded their own self-governed communities. He soon debuted his first album, Terapia, and with it, a new musical genre—Afro-Cuban funk. Terapia exploded onto Havana’s music scene, filling balconies, almendrones (Cuban taxis usually vibrating with loud reggaeton), dance floors, and groups of teens wheeling boom boxes around town—a niche music market usually reserved for trap music and über-Cuban reggaeton. Before long, Cubans couldn’t leave the house without hearing Cimafunk’s hit song “Me Voy” from a neighbor’s window or the car repairman’s radio. The band generated devoted followers, breaking attendance records at Havana’s top spots like the Fabrica del Arte Cubano. Its immediate success derived from Cimafunk’s ability to shatter the well-defined barriers that have historically separated fans of genres such as trova, rock, jazz and reggaeton. Now audiences are becoming familiar with that unique sound in the United States. During a 50-day, 30-performance tour of 16 US cities, Cimafunk played concerts at historic venues like Tipitina’s in New Orleans, the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, and North Beach Bandshell in Miami. They sold out most shows; toward the end of the tour they had to start turning down requests from additional venues hoping to book this new Cuban sensation. But Cimafunk and his band did more than perform; they also took on the role of cultural ambassadors. In each city they visited, musical performances were complemented with cultural, academic, and community gigs. Cimafunk shared his view on race and gender issues with students at U Penn, Brown, Howard, Morgan State, Tulane, and American University. In Los Angeles, fresh off a private performance at a mansion in the hills of Hollywood, the group visited Skid Row to provide food, T-shirts, and, of course, do a jam session. Along the way, the band offered showcases at Netflix, Google, Standard Hotels, and the California Museum of Oakland. And in New York, Iglesias spoke at the venerable Council of the Americas on Park Avenue, describing his growth as an artist in Havana and his experience touring the United States—including his Miami show, jam-packed with members of the Cuban-American diasapora. “I really don’t care what is their position,” Cimafunk said of his approach to the traditionally hard-line Miami exile community. “If they came in a boat, or if they came in a plane, or if they came running—that’s not important for me, I just want them to have a good time at the show.” With his newfound fame as a performer and composer, Cimafunk has the credentials to transcend national borders, and international differences, as well as to conquer bigger stages and wider audiences. As he fields offers for a major recording contract, plans a new album and soon thereafter another international tour, the young man from the tobacco fields of Pinar del Rio now has the chance to consolidate his revolution in sound and export it across oceans—demonstrating the multicultural reach of world-class fusion that is Cuban music. Amid the Trump administration’s punitive pressures on Cuba, Cimafunk’s US tour demonstrates the powerful nature of his music. Within a short month this spring, Cimafunk has become one of the most important cultural bridges between the United States and Cuba. The band and its music are true people-to-people ambassadors, practicing the art of cultural diplomacy. As the Trump administration moves to prevent its own citizens from traveling to Cuba to hear music there and escalates the cold-war rhetoric of regime change, Cimafunk has heated up concert halls for hundreds of Americans every night. His music showcases the power of groove to bring people, as well as countries, together.<end_of_turn>

# Is Social Media's Toxicity Because Of The Web's Shift From Enlightenment To Entertainment?

The modern Web came into existence as a tool of enlightenment, a way for researchers to share knowledge and discoveries more freely with others. This first chapter of its evolution was prefaced upon the idea that information was free and that the digital world was a place to learn and discover. Yet this utopia was quickly usurped by the cyber world’s limitless commercial potential and today has devolved into an entertainment wonderland focused on commercial monetization and manipulation. Could the key to the Web’s salvation lie in a return to enlightenment?  Today’s Web looks little like the Web of yesteryear.  Setting aside its graphical and interactive emphasis, today’s Web focuses on entertainment and consumerism, from social media to streaming movies to shopping sites.  The Web has become a place to escape the physical world to be entertained rather than a place that expands our horizons towards learning new things.  Today’s Web gifts us access to all the world’s information at our fingertips. We can read news from the other side of the globe or learn about what life is like across the planet. A Google search is all that’s needed to see the world. Yet instead of embracing our newfound digital transport, we remain at home, searching about the same places we always have.    Despite the entire world at our fingertips, we have little interest in expanding our horizons. We are no more likely to seek out new information than we were before. All that technology that connects us has been in vain.  Instead, we are interested only in entertainment.  Rather than spend hours reading news from other countries and learning about new cultures or languages or reading about history or brushing up on our math skills or taking up a new humanities or arts interest, we would far rather spend the evening glued to our phone watching cat videos.  The Web is far from alone in this devolution. Every communications technology undergoes such a transition from enlightenment to entertainment.  As radio evolved, its detractors lamented its shift from informing to entertaining. As television matured, the FCC warned of the social impacts of its transition towards mindless entertainment that had no societal value.  In the same fashion, the Web has migrated from its early focus on knowledge to similarly emphasize mindless fun. We rarely turn to Twitter or Facebook to learn about the world. We turn to them to catch up with friends and family and to pass the time. Our smartphones that can access the world are used to play games and post snarky comments.  Even our personal information production is oriented towards entertainment rather than expanding our understanding. We obsess over social shares and viral fame rather than engage in thoughtful dialog that advances society.  Could it be that this shift towards entertainment is what lies at the root of the Web’s devolution into toxicity?  The pursuit of scholarly knowledge can involve considerable disagreement and disputes. Yet these are resolved through research, citations and clinical discourse, not name-calling, hateful slurs and death threats screamed in public. The focus is on thoughtful debate that advances the field rather than viral fame that entertains others. In short, disagreement is an obstacle to be overcome in the pursuit of something greater, rather than an outcome to be encouraged in its own right for the sake of entertaining others.  What if the Web was more like scholarship?  Putting this all together, could the Web’s troubles lie in the devolution of its focus from enlightenment to entertainment, much as happened to each of the mediums that preceded it? What if the Web were more like scholarly discourse, focused on bettering ourselves with education and expanded horizons than escapism and entertainment? If we were focused to speak only in clinical discourse, cite each of our claims and refrain from emotional speech, could we reform social media into a tool once again for education and enlightenment? Or is the Web’s destiny to be forever an entertainment medium? Could it be that the Web will naturally reinvent itself in the next technological revolution, much as radio reinvented itself in the Web era as the podcast and reasserted its educational roots?  In the end, will the future of the Web lie in a return to its past?<end_of_turn>

# Deadly crackdown on Sudan sit-in haunts protesters

KHARTOUM: It was the crack of dawn when armed men in pick-up trucks stormed into a Khartoum protest camp, shooting and beating hundreds of Sudanese demonstrators on June 3. "Everyone started running for their lives," said protester Akram, who gave only his first name fearing reprisals by authorities. "It was very brutal." Crowds of protesters camped outside the Khartoum army headquarters were violently dispersed that day by armed men in military fatigues, leaving dozens dead and hundreds wounded, according to doctors and witnesses. They had been gathered at the complex since April, initially seeking the army´s help to oust longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir, and later to demand the generals hand power to a civilian administration. Akram said some of the armed men wore police uniforms, while others were in military fatigues generally worn by the feared Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group. He said it was difficult to count how many they were, but the gunmen arrived in trucks and raided the sit-in from all sides. "They first attacked us with batons and sticks," Akram, dressed in the same blue shirt he wore the day of the crackdown, told AFP at the home of a fellow protester in Khartoum. "At first the protesters were able to push back," he said, describing the early morning raid. "But then a bigger force wearing the uniform of the Rapid Support Forces stormed in and started shooting protesters who were standing at the barricades." During the weeks-long sit-in, protesters had put up barricades at all entry points to the camp to prevent security forces from entering and attempting to clear them. But on June 3 the demonstrators were no match for the armed men. "Blood for blood, we will not accept compensation," demonstrators chant, using a catchcry of the protest movement as they come under attack in footage Akram took on his phone during the assault. The footage shows protesters, both women and men, running through the wide-open area, many of them bleeding as gunfire cracks the early morning calm. Akram said protesters hurled rocks at the armed men but failed to stop the assault. "I saw two female doctors beaten, dragged and stripped of their head scarves," he said, still shocked from the violence he witnessed. Other protesters with him at the Khartoum house left the room as he recalled the violence, unable to listen to the testimony. Akram believes he is simply lucky to be alive. "Four times I was standing in a spot and someone behind me was shot," he said, adding that those trying to film the violence on their phones were primary targets. He recalled watching people rushed into a makeshift field clinic at the protest camp. "There was blood gushing out from legs, stomachs and arms." With armed men in full control, Akram had no choice but to escape.<end_of_turn>

# Terry signs new Villa deal

Assistant head coach John Terry has signed a contract extension at Aston Villa.  The 38-year-old, who helped Villa return to the Premier League last season, had 12 months left on his existing deal but will now remain at the club until 2021.  Terry had been mentioned as a potential successor to former Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard at Derby should he replace Maurizio Sarri at Stamford Bridge.       The new Villa contract for Terry now appears to have ruled out that possibility, leaving boss Dean Smith delighted the former Chelsea and England captain has decided to prolong his stay at Villa Park.  “I am really pleased that JT has extended his current deal as he is a pleasure to work with,” Smith told the club website.  “We have had a successful start to our Villa coaching careers and JT has been instrumental in joining myself, Richard O’Kelly and Neil Cutler.  “He has complimented the team that we have and I have no doubts he will go on to be a top manager in the years to come.  `”Our focus now is on the coming season and to try to continue the progress we have had in the past eight months.”  Terry enjoyed a glittering playing career, winning five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, three League Cups, the Champions League and Europa League with Chelsea.  He then spent his final season before retirement at Villa in 2017/18 as the club reached the Championship play-off final, losing to Fulham.  In October last year, Terry was appointed as part of Smith’s coaching team following the latter’s arrival as successor to Steve Bruce.  Terry played an important role as Villa again reached the Championship play-off final, clinching promotion to the Premier League with a 2-1 victory over Derby at Wembley last month.  Writing on his Instagram, Terry said: “I’m delighted to have extended my contract at Aston Villa.  “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed assisting, working and learning from the gaffer, Richard and Cutts, and look forward to doing so for the season ahead.  “Now tougher challenges are ahead as we focus on making our mark on the most competitive league in the world.  “I’m sure the fans will get behind us, as they always do, and help make Villa Park a tough place to come and play.”<end_of_turn>

# One more day with rain and storms in Southwest Florida

Watch out for a little rain early this morning coming in from the Gulf of Mexico. Showers and storms will tend to favor the coast early in the day before heading inland this afternoon. Sunshine will be more abundant today, which will send temperatures close to 90 degrees for our daytime highs. Rain chances drop off substantially Thursday and Friday, and we'll also turn up the heat with highs rebounding into the mid-90s.

# Burnaby RCMP issues warning about suspected lug nut loosener after vehicle’s wheel comes off - BC | Globalnews.ca

Burnaby RCMP issues warning about suspected lug nut loosener after vehicle’s wheel comes off  Police are warning Burnaby motorists to check their vehicles before driving after receiving reports of someone loosening lug nuts on at least two vehicles. The Burnaby RCMP said the reported incidents took place between June 11 and June 17.  In one case, Mounties said the driver’s wheel actually came off their vehicle while they were driving on Marine Way at Byrne Road. Fortunately, no one was injured, police said. In the other case, a driver reported that someone had loosened the lug nuts on their wheel while their vehicle was parked in the 3500 block of Brighton Avenue sometime between 4:30 p.m. and 5:10 p.m. on Monday. WATCH: Has anyone seen my tire?  “Both of these incidents could have had serious consequences, and it’s a good reminder for drivers to always ensure vehicles are safe to drive,” said Cpl. Daniela Panesar in a media release. “While we are unsure if these incidents are linked, we are asking that drivers make sure to check their wheels before driving to ensure wheel lug nuts have not been loosened.”  Anyone who believes their vehicle has been similarly altered or sees anyone behaving suspiciously around vehicles is asked to contact the Burnaby RCMP.  © 2019 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.<end_of_turn>

# Mysterious booms in Monroe County leave neighbors on edge nightly

Mysterious booms in Monroe County leave neighbors on edge nightly  STANFORD, Ind. — Neighbors in Monroe County aren’t afraid of what goes bump in the night, but they sure are frustrated by it.  For the past two weeks, homeowners near Stanford, outside of Bloomington, have been woken up by loud booms in the middle of the night. They start around 11 p.m. and can repeat every 15 to 30 minutes.  “It’s keeping us up at night,” one neighbor told us while asking to remain anonymous. “We are not able to go to sleep because we hear these loud noises, and my daughter is waking up.”  “It rattles the walls. The whole house shakes when it happens,” Travis York said of his neighborhood.  “The neighbor’s dog, she starts pacing in the early evening because she knows it’s coming,” homeowner Cathy Hudson said.  “This last week and the last few days, it’s been quite a few every night,” Ronnie Campbell remarked while pointing toward the direction of the booms.  Neighbors thought they may be fireworks, however, no one ever sees an explosion in the air. They believe it may be happening near Kirksville and Harmony Road.  “It looks like daylight outside when it happens, like it lights up the whole area,” York said. His wife Kim added, “Our nine and 10-year-old came back because they thought something had exploded in our house.”  The Monroe County Sheriff’s Office said they have no reports of blast noises, however, people we spoke with said they’ve called. Sheriff Brad Swain suggests it could be someone shooting at tannerite, which is an explosive target for marksmen. His second guess is the noise is from operations at Crane Naval Base in nearby Green County, but neighbors believe that’s too far. It appears the mystery remains.<end_of_turn>

# Gold Rush Days sends Yreka back in time

The festivities brought out many community members who enjoyed a wide range of activities. For youngsters, there were pony rides by Rockin’ Maddy Ranch, as well as balloon animals by Kathleen Lee and a magic show by Siskiyou County’s Delbert Lee.  Downtown Yreka buzzed with activity Saturday as Gold Rush Days brought a bit of the Old West back to town. The event included the Old West Reenactment Club Shooters.  In the center of Miner Street next to the historic Franco American Hotel was an outdoor recreation of an old west saloon. A group of spectators watched events unfold, many covering their ears in anticipation for what they knew would soon take place. A group of re-enactors mingled about, played cards, or had a drink. An ill tempered, quick triggered character named Butch Brass was none too pleased with the beers served to him by the bartender and he became more and more agitated. Words were exchanged, guns were drawn, and the loud sound of gunfire rang through the air as smoke came out of the barrels of the guns fired.  Roger Esplin, (also known as Butch Brass) explained that the gunfights are carefully choreographed and that they have safety protocols in place. This includes making sure participants fire the weapons from a certain distance and angle them in a way that looks like they are shooting at each other but are, in fact, not aiming directly at the other person. Esplin has taken part in these reenactments in Yreka for seven years.  “It's fun and exciting to be able to do this here each year,” he said.  He said that he and the other reenactors enjoy presenting audiences a bit of history done in a fun, mainly comically broad fashion, and hopes at the same time it sparks in folks interest in learning about and preserving history.  Gary Hanson, who portrayed the bartender, said that reenactments like this are a way to have the younger generation stop texting for a minute and learn a bit about the history of the area and the old west and to educate and help preserve this history.  Ten year old Jaela Linderman of Yreka enjoyed watching the reenactment with her sister, 5 year old Mia.  “It was loud but I liked it,” Jaela said. “It was cool. I liked the very beautiful clothing they wore.”  The festivities brought out many community members who enjoyed a wide range of activities. For youngsters, there were pony rides by Rockin’ Maddy Ranch, as well as balloon animals by Kathleen Lee and a magic show by Siskiyou County’s Delbert Lee.  Live music was performed throughout the day, while folks with a hankering for a bite to eat could purchase items such as tri tip sandwiches, tacos, and hot dogs, as well as burgers and smoothies dished out by the Yreka Elks Club. Many folks enjoyed looking over the vendor tables full of a variety of items, from jams, bird houses with the logos of professional sports teams like the Golden State Warriors and Oakland Raiders, to handmade jewelry.  There was also a beer garden featuring the Etna Brewing Company for those who wished to purchase an adult beverage.<end_of_turn>

# Alzheimer’s fundraiser set for Thursday at Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority in Talladega (free content)

TALLADEGA -- June is Brain Awareness Month, a monthlong effort to raise awareness about the seriousness of Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia. Please join the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. (Mu Tau Omega & Chi Chapter) in spreading the word about Alzheimer’s and supporting our local Alzheimer’s Chapter and founder Clifford Mosley. According to a press release, Thursday, June 21, is the date set aside for Alzheimer’s awareness. For that purpose, the day has been entitled “The Longest Day.” Donations will be taken today at the AKA Sorority House at 806 W. Battle St., Talladega, from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.  Many Americans dismiss the warning signs of Alzheimer’s, the release says, believing these symptoms are a normal part of aging. This is of even greater concern for African-Americans, who are two times more likely to develop late-onset Alzheimer’s disease than whites and less likely to have a diagnosis of their condition, resulting in less time for treatment and planning. Purple Pulpit Sunday Purple Pulpit Sunday is each Sunday in May and June at participating churches in the Talladega area. The purpose is to bring attention to the tremendous burden Alzheimer’s and other dementia are having on the African-American community; to utilize the power and influence of the African American pulpit to bring awareness; to distribute the facts about Alzheimer’s; and to encourage and support persons living with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers.  Organizers also hope these Sundays will encourage local residents to support and donate toward Mosley’s Alzheimer’s awareness efforts. Items needed include Depends (adult sizes, male and female), hand sanitizer liquids and wipes, baby wipes, liquid hand soap, lotion and monetary donations made out to the Alzheimer's Support Group. Donations can be dropped off at Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. today. The Alzheimer’s Support Group meet every second Saturday at 10 a.m. in the banquet room of Brookwood Baptist Medical Center/Citizens Baptist Health Center in Talladega.<end_of_turn>

# AFCON: Nigeria are always favourites, says Adepoju - The Nation Newspaper

Ex-Nigerian midfielder Mutiu Adepoju believes the Super Eagles are among the favourites to win the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, based on their squad depth and quality players.  Gernot Rohr’s men are in Egypt to challenge for a fourth African title, but they must first see off Madagascar, Burundi and Guinea in Group B.  While acknowledging that the Super Eagles will head into the finals in the North African country as contenders for the trophy, he feels pressurising the team to emerge as champions could serve as an obstacle for the three-time African winners.  “Nigeria is always favourite because they are the team to beat and that’s why it’s not surprising when you see teams who play against them come out in full force,” Adepoju told Goal. “Those who tip the Super Eagles as favourites are not wrong because of the quality of players they parade.  “Nevertheless, I would want us to move step by step and see how we progress in the competition.  “That being said, it will be disappointing if the Super Eagles don’t make it to the final because every Nigerian wants to see them up there.  “However, anything can happen in football because you can play the best game and still lose. Mind you, other teams in Egypt are not there to make up the numbers – they want to win also.  “But our focus is to see the team do very well and play to instructions – not fans mounting pressure on the<end_of_turn>

# What hospitals must do now

The recent episode of attack on doctors in a Kolkata hospital and the subsequent strike by doctors across the country put the spotlight on the issue of violence against medical personnel. A study conducted by the Indian Medical Association a few years ago found that a whopping 75% of surveyed doctors had suffered some form of physical violence while on official duty. A majority of these assaults are reported from ICUs or Emergency Room, where critically ill patients are admitted.  At the root of this problem is the paucity of healthcare resources. Shortage of human resources, medical infrastructure and the number of beds are problems that must be addressed at the policy level. Saddled with a meagre healthcare budget and limited resources, public hospitals present a dismal picture where overcrowding and a long waiting time are the norm. A limited number of doctors and nurses are constantly struggling to meet the needs of a large number of patients. Lack of sufficient security and protection for doctors also embolden mobs to violence.  This disturbing trend is also symptomatic of the changing relationship between doctors and patients. With the proliferation of private clinics and the emergence of corporate hospitals, there is a growing perception that doctors are operating with the intention of fleecing.  The mistrust has also been fuelled by constant media scrutiny that highlights malpractices and corruption by medical practitioners. There is an interpersonal angle to the erosion of trust as well. Overwhelmed by the rush of patients, busy doctors often do not have enough time to invest in in-depth conversation with patients.  With doctors busy in clinical work, there is a need to have adequate number of managers to provide administrative and managerial support so as to allow doctors to perform their duties without fear or distraction. The officials responsible for hospital administration must not only have managerial skills but also adequate soft skills, a compassionate approach and understanding of social and behavioural issues. Here are a few necessary elements of sound hospital management:  Consent, communication  At no point should the relatives of patients be misinformed or given unreasonable expectations of recovery when the patient is critical. It is important that in case of critical patients, treating doctors meet families every day, more than once if required, and clearly explain to them the prognosis. Having a regular and honest communication ensures that they have no false expectations.  Informed consent is another significant step in preventing violence. While attendants are always made to sign documents before a medical procedure, doctors or hospital managements hardly explain the contents of the documents to medically illiterate families.  The golden rule of consent taking is “The person (doctor) who holds the knife holds the pen.” In other words, consent should be taken only by the doctors treating a patient after explaining in detail and in a language understood by the patient/family. Not to forget the need to have proper documentation of the patient’s course of treatment so as to be secure in case a matter goes to court.  Compassion  It is essential for hospital managers to inculcate compassion and care among all staff members. For doctors and medical staff witnessing serious illnesses and mortality, it is an everyday affair. However, for families that lose a member, it is nothing less than an earth-shaking event. It is important to be considerate to them, make processes smooth and quick and eliminate unnecessary hassle. Care must be taken that attendants of critically ill patients are not pestered too frequently to pay bills. Doctors and staff members must try to console grief-stricken families and counsellors for emotional support should also be made available. Compassionate treatment can go a long way in pre-empting any kind of unrest.  Be prepared  While all efforts must be made to pre-empt violence, it is also important to be prepared to deal with a violent situation, much like you are prepared to handle emergencies such as a fire or earthquake. One of the most important steps to prevent violence inside a hospital premise is to restrict entry of attendants through passes. Security guards must be placed not just at the hospital gates but also at sensitive areas such as ICUs and emergency units. Staff members at such locations must also be trained to stay alert to signs of possible unrest. A standard operating procedure must be developed and each staff member should be aware of the do’s and don’ts of such situations. If signs of aggression are noticed, senior management must immediately reach the spot and intervene.  Rebuild trust  For the medical community at large, it is important to make efforts to rebuild the lost trust between doctors and patients. They must also make efforts to not just treat patients physically but also assuage their concerns, remove their doubts and help reduce stress. The corporate houses that are investing in the field of medicine must pay attention to creating affordable healthcare facilities.  (The writer is MD, Paras Healthcare)<end_of_turn>

# Woman sues RCMP officer who asked 'were you at all turned on?' in interview | CBC News

Woman sues RCMP officer who asked 'were you at all turned on?' in interview Lawsuit alleges interview was a 'reckless misogynistic and arrogant departure' from expected standard An Indigenous woman who was interrogated by a Kelowna RCMP officer in March, 2012, after reporting reporting a sexual assault, is now suing the officer. A video of the interview was made public in May, drawing condemnation from members of parliament and a review by the RCMP. In it, the officer is heard asking the woman whether she was "at all turned on" by the reported sexual assault. The woman, who is not being identified, because she was 17 at the time of the interview, is suing Kelowna RCMP Cpl. Kenneth Hall, the Attorney General of Canada and B.C.'s minister of justice. In her notice of civil claim, the woman alleges the two-hour interview was demeaning, insulting and abusive. She claims Hall's interrogation "was a reckless misogynistic and arrogant departure from the standard expected of a professionally trained RCMP member." The plaintiff alleges she attended the interview, because she was under the impression she was there to report a serious sexual assault, but she was treated as a suspect for public mischief, and she claims Hall and others "used the degrading, malicious interrogation as a punishment." Seeks damages In the documents filed in B.C. Supreme Court, the woman lists several consequences stemming from the interview, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, nervous shock, insomnia, nightmares, and attempted suicide. She's seeking a range of damages from Hall, the Attorney General of Canada, and B.C.'s minister of justice. Hall and the other defendants have yet to file a statements of defence in the case. According to the RCMP, Hall is not doing media interviews and he's respecting the legal process. An RCMP spokesperson responded to a request for comment from CBC News by referring to a statement issued by deputy commissioner, Jennifer Strachan, earlier this month. "We agree that on the surface this case doesn't appear to align with public expectations or the current standards and practices in place when addressing sex assault investigations and supporting victims," the statement read.

# Fabrene marks 50 years in North Bay

One of North Bay’s largest private companies is celebrating half a century in business. Dozens of current and former employees marked Fabrene Inc.’s 50th anniversary Wednesday at the company’s site on Dupont Road. A division of the Fortune 500 company Berry Global, Fabrene employs approximately 200 people and manufactures a range of products, from roofing membranes and housewraps to tarps and covers, for the construction and print media industries. “It’s quite an achievement being in manufacturing in Northern Ontario and to exist for 50 years,” site director Rob Valenti said. Valenti joined Fabrene right out of school 30 years ago as a process engineer and worked in a number of different areas, including scheduling and customer service, before becoming plant director. “We were the only game in town and we sold 200 million square-metres of lumber wrap in a year, now we don’t do any lumber wrap, so we continue to reinvent ourselves, new products, new markets, highly engineered, super hard to copy, and that’s what keeps us in the game,” he said. What has also made the difference in that time is the people, he said, many of whom have made his career “immensely great. “You spend a good portion of your life working, so to these guys there was quite a bond.” Fabrene began production in June 1969 as a division of DuPont Canada, manufacturing woven polyolefin fabrics for packaging and industrial end uses. The early years of the company saw it produce carpet backing, packaging for fibres and some of the first elastic tapes use in diapers. Fabrene was also the world’s largest producer of lumber wrap and introduced the first and only housewrap entirely made in Canada. Rhonda Leggett, who has worked about half of her 20-year career with the company in payroll and accounts payable, said the business has changed hands numerous times, but even then it still holds the Fabrene name. “It’s amazing to belong to a company that’s been in North Bay this long,” she said. John Spencer has seen his fair share of changes as well. Spencer started out with Fabrene as a design engineer in June 1979 and worked under five different owners before retiring at the end of 2014, with 15 years of experience as a plant manager. “It’s a tough environment to be in private industry,” he said. “We are a global company, we survived by our own innovation skills, no one’s doing it for us, always been that way, and it is a great team of people, it really is.” Looking back on his career with the company, Spencer attributed Fabrene’s worldwide competitiveness to the excellent people it employs. “Met a lot of great people, had a lot of good teachers, a lot of good colleagues and a great group of mentors, so I’ve been very fortunate,” he said. “Built my life and my career and raised my family here, and it’s just been a great experience.”<end_of_turn>

# As it approaches 150 years, Plainville plans celebration for July

Plainville residents, along with out-of-town visitors, will get a chance to learn about local history when the community celebrates its 150th anniversary next month.  The town has planned a walking tour and a community picnic, Town Council Vice President Deborah Tompkins told central Connecticut business leaders recently. The volunteer committee that’s organizing the events is also selling commemorative silver coins to note the milestone.  There will be a display of memorabilia from the defunct Plainville Stadium, where car races and occasional circuses were once held. The property along New Britain Avenue also had an adjacent drive-in theater; the land is now home to retail plazas.  “One of our big things is (local resident) Don Moon and his crew doing a set-up for the old Plainville Stadium,” said John Kisluk, a long-time Plainville resident.  The historical society has put together an exhibition of items from the town’s history, with photos of some of its 19th century factories and 18th century homes and taverns. Plainville was settled in the mid to late 1600s, but didn’t officially incorporate as a town until July 1869.  Kisluk, 71, was a young man when the town hosted its 100th anniversary gala in 1969. He remembers it well.  “It was huge. There was a parade, they had horses, fire companies came in from all over — you name it,” Kisluk recalled.  The 2019 version won’t be as elaborate, but will be held over two days.  On July 20, the Plainville Historical Society will host a walking tour of about 20 prominent historical sites. The town picnic is set for Norton Park on July 21 from noon to 4 p.m. There will be four live bands, food trucks, children’s activities and more. Organizers said a central feature will be games from the 1869 era.  The picnic will follow the conclusion of the annual 5K road race organized by the Petit Family Foundation as a fundraiser for central Connecticut charities and civic causes. The race will start and end near Plainville High School; details are at www.petitroadrace.com.  Kisluk is heading the committee’s sale of 300 commemorative silver coins minted specifically for the anniversary. They bear the Plainville name and the notation “1869-2019.” They are being sold at the town clerk’s office at town hall.  “They’re 1 troy ounce, .999 fine silver and the same size as a silver dollar,” Kisluk said. “We wanted to have something that people would keep. Nobody’s going to throw this away.”  Full details about the walking tour, picnic and coin sale are available at www.facebook.com/Plainville150th/.<end_of_turn>

# Dhawan will comeback stronger than ever, says Tendulkar

New Delhi [India], Jun 20 : Sachin Tendulkar on Thursday sympathised with injured Shikhar Dhawan for his exit in the middle of the ongoing ICC Men's Cricket World Cup. The master-blaster took Twitter, saying Dhawan was playing well and getting injured in such an important tournament is heartbreaking. Tendulkar also wished Rishabh Pant, who has replaced Dhawan in the 15-man squad. The member of the 2011 World Cup winning team, Tendulkar said there cannot be a bigger platform for Pant to express himself. "Feel for you Shikhar. You were playing well & to be injured in the middle of such an important tournament is heartbreaking. I'm sure you'll come back stronger than ever. Rishabh you've been playing well & there can't be a bigger platform to express yourself. Good luck!" Tendulkar tweeted. ICC on Wednesday approved wicket-keeper batsman Pant as a replacement for injured batsman Dhawan in India's squad for the remainder of the tournament. Dhawan expressed his gratitude to Indian cricket fans, saying it is time for him to go back and recover after getting ruled out of the remainder of the 50-over tournament. In a video shared by Dhawan on Twitter, the left-hander batsman said: "Unfortunately, my thumb won't be recovering on time. I really wanted to play the World Cup and represent my country. Now it's time for me to go back and recover well and be ready for the next selection." The opening batsman further said that he is sure India will do good and win the World Cup trophy. Dhawan also asked fans to continue their support and signed off, saying, "Love you all, take care." "I'm sure boys (are) doing a great job at the moment and going to do really great and win the World Cup. Keep praying for us and keep supporting us. Your support and prayers are very very important and very dear to us. Thank you all again for all your support and love. Love you all, take care," he said. BCCI had requested the ICC to bring in Pant as a replacement of injured Dhawan, who is currently nursing an injury on the back of his left hand in the region between the index finger and thumb. During a fixture against Australia on June 9, he was hit by a Pat Cummins bouncer. However, Dhawan went onto play a match-winning knock of 117 off 109 balls which helped India secure a 36-run win. "Dhawan has a fracture on the base of his first metacarpal on his left hand. Based on several specialist opinions, he will remain in a cast till mid-July, which rules him out of the World Cup. We have requested ICC to allow Rishabh Pant to be as a replacement," India team manager Sunil Subramaniam had said in a press conference. India will take on Afghanistan on June 22 at the Rose Bowl in Southampton.  Dhawan will comeback stronger than ever, says Tendulkar  Updated: Jun 20, 2019 16:16 IST<end_of_turn>

# UGASports - Claxton Brooklyn bound

Claxton Brooklyn bound  The wait was longer than many predicted, but ultimately Nicolas Claxton learned his professional home Thursday night at the NBA Draft when the Brooklyn Nets chose the former Georgia player with the first pick of the second round. Claxton, the 31st overall selection, was one of just two players remaining in the "green room" along with Oregon's Bol Bol, before his name was finally called. "I was here two or three weeks ago, I worked out for the team and really enjoyed it. I knew there was a pretty good possibility that I’d be picked here," Claxton told reporters shortly after being selected. "It’s a blessing and I’m ready to get to work here in Brooklyn. I couldn’t have scripted it any better. I feel like God already has things already placed out for me.” Georgia head coach Tom Crean said Brooklyn got itself a good one. “We are all very happy for Nic,” Crean said. “Being drafted by an organization on the upswing like the Brooklyn Nets that is so well run by Sean Marks and well coached by Kenny Atkinson will be tremendous for Nic. Personally, I was hopeful he’d go to an organization that was totally committed to player development, and that’s definitely the case with Brooklyn.” The 6-foot-11, 217-pounder won't be expected to be a main contributor right away for the Nets, although he's anxious to try and prove that he can. Adding weight and gaining muscle will be Job 1. “That’s something I know that’s going to be very critical for me, making sure I continue to put on some good weight and good strength," Claxton said. "I’ll just continue to work extremely hard in the weight room like I’ve been doing these past few years. The rest will take care of itself.” Once he does, Claxton feels the sky's the limit. “My game starts with defense but offensively I have a great handle for my size. I’ll continue to work on my jump shot. I can hit an open jump shot," he said. "I’ve got a lot of confidence in myself and I definitely think I’ll be able to do a lot, post up, take bigger guys outside and working them out that way.” Claxton is Georgia's first draft pick since Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in 2013. Although he only played two years for the Bulldogs, Claxton enjoyed a successful career, earning second-team All-SEC honors by the league coaches back in March. A 6-11, 220-pound forward, Claxton is the only player to start all 31 games for Georgia this season and leads the Bulldogs in scoring (13.0 ppg), rebounding (8.6 rpg), blocks (2.4 bpg) and steals (1.1 spg). He is second on the team in assists (1.8 apg). Claxton also paces Georgia in double-digit scoring performances (20), double-figure rebounding efforts (12) and double-doubles (eight). Twice this season, Claxton led the Bulldogs in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals, doing so against Kennesaw State and Oakland. He became the first SEC player to accomplish that feat in multiple games since Ben Simmons did three times during the 2015-16 season. Claxton was named SEC Player of the Week on Dec. 31, a day after a 20-point, 11-rebound performance against UMass. He finished No. 2 in both rebounds and blocks. Nationally, he enters this week ranked No. 10 in blocks and No. 54 in boards. Claxton has blocked 74 shots this season, which ranks No. 7 among Georgia’s all-time single-season leaders, and his 268 rebounds is No. 15 among the Bulldogs’ best-ever efforts. In Brooklyn, the Nets are counting on Claxton ultimately forming a dangerous 1-2 punch with current center Jared Allen, formerly of the Texas Longhorns. "I look forward to that. Jared Allen, I know he’s a great, great shot blocker and me and him on the same court, especially once when I put some weight on, is really going to put pressure on other teams," Claxton said. "I’ll really rely him, build a good relationship with him so he can help me any way possible.”<end_of_turn>

# A Chinese soccer club in meltdown - Taipei Times

When Brazilian star Alexandre Pato jetted out of China for his holidays, he played for Tianjin Quanjian. Two months and a dozen arrests later, the club as he knew it is gone. In its place is a new incarnation, although whether Pato is still there when the Chinese Super League (CSL) season opens in the spring remains to be seen. A discredited subsidiary of the Quanjian Group remain the owners, according to corporate records, but the club was this week renamed Tianjin Tianhai and placed under the control of the local sports authorities, state media said. The team is facing a deeply uncertain future, hunting investment and reportedly needing to sell players to survive. The affair is a microcosm of the worst of soccer: excessive spending, unpredictability and an overreliance on questionable corporate owners. Tianjin Quanjian’s troubles came to light late last month when its owners, self-styled experts in traditional Chinese medicine, came under scrutiny for their treatment of a young cancer patient. The girl was reportedly taken off chemotherapy and instead received alternative healthcare based on Quanjian-produced remedies. She died in December 2015 aged seven. Quanjian faced a public outcry over the girl’s death after an article published on an online health platform last month was shared extensively — leading to a rapid questioning of other claims it had made for its products. The company on Jan. 1 was placed under investigation for alleged pyramid selling and false advertising, Xinhua reported. Quanjian founder Shu Yuhui was among more than a dozen arrested, the China Daily said. The company has denied wrongdoing in relation to the girl.  Soccer history is littered with once-proud clubs that crashed and burned for whatever reason — but the rapid pace and murky nature of the Tianjin meltdown has stunned observers. Shen Chen has been an avid follower of soccer in Tianjin since he was six. Now 33, Shen said: “If Tianjin doesn’t find a better company to take over, the team is very likely to get relegated, and if by the end of the year no company comes in, the team may be disbanded and the players released.” Tianjin Quanjian’s maroon, blue and gold crest has been unceremoniously removed from club buildings and replaced by the blue of the new Tianjin Tianhai. The old name is also being erased online with its posts on Sina Weibo deleted and the club badge scrubbed out. It is a far cry from just more than a year ago. Tianjin Quanjian finished third in the 2016-2017 CSL season under the leadership of Italy World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro, the highest in their short history. Former AC Milan starlet Pato, now 29, was part of an expensive attack along with Frenchman Anthony Modeste. The club — thanks to Quanjian’s cash — also boasted Belgium international midfielder Axel Witsel. Only Pato now remains and he and his teammates, who are in pre-season training in the United Arab Emirates, have reportedly been muzzled. Chinese fans are used to their clubs changing names or even pulling up stakes for different cities. The Tianjin club was founded in 2006 and initially played in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, about 600km from Tianjin. It moved to Tianjin the next year and became Tianjin Quanjian in 2015 when the ambitious company took control as part of its rise to prominence. The club’s unraveling has received scant coverage in the state Tianjin Daily, suggesting that authorities are eager to keep a lid on the affair.<end_of_turn>

# AFC Championship: Former Worcester student-athletes Jordan Lucas, Jimmy Murray in title game with Chiefs

Jordan Lucas was participating in offseason workouts with the Miami Dolphins last spring, when the third-year safety and his soon-to-be wife got the news they were going to have their first baby.  The couple, who were wed in early October after having been engaged for over a year, was overjoyed with the news. Then Jordan and Taylor burst out laughing after they discovered the due date — Feb. 3.  “We were like, ‘Oh snap, that’s when the Super Bowl is this year,’ ” Lucas said Friday. “We’re in Miami and not really thinking about (making) the Super Bowl. So it was just a joke to us. Then I got traded here.”  Here would be Kansas City.  The Chiefs acquired Lucas, who grew up outside New York City and spent a postgraduate year at Worcester Academy in 2011-12, at the end of August for a late-round draft pick. Suddenly, the odds of making Super Bowl LIII significantly improved.  Now, five months later, Lucas and the Chiefs are one game away from booking a trip to Atlanta and Taylor is two weeks away from her due date.  And all that stands in the way of a curious cosmic collision are the Patriots, who will meet the Chiefs in the AFC Championship at 6:40 p.m. Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium.  “Oh man, it’s very exciting,” Lucas said.  Teammate Jimmy Murray, a 2018 graduate of Holy Cross, seconded the emotion.  “The city is excited for sure and I just think there’s a general excitement around the building right now,” the rookie center said Thursday. “But at the same time we’re in here working. It’s going to be a big challenge, but I think we’ll be ready.”  Murray, a four-year starter for the Crusaders, signed with the Chiefs in early May after going undrafted. He was released Aug. 31, but signed to the practice squad two days later.  The 6-foot-5, 305-pound Murray was promoted to the 53-man roster Oct. 23, where he has resided since. He’s appeared in two games.  The fact Murray remains on the roster despite seeing limited action indicates he’s made a positive impression on the organization. And the same goes for Murray when it comes to the Chiefs.  “The season is long — that’s something that kind of changed for me in college,” said Murray, who typically displays his school pride by wearing HC gear in the locker room. “But I was really able to adapt after seeing the way people around me work.  “They come in with the same mindset every day and are just ready to go and go through that process. So I think that has kind of helped us go through the playoffs, too.”  Murray is vying to join Eddie Jenkins (Dolphins, Super Bowl VII) and Bruce Kozerski (Cincinnati Bengals, Super Bowl XXIII) as the third Holy Cross alum to be a member of a Super Bowl team.  As for Lucas, he drew plenty of interest coming out of New Rochelle High, but didn’t have the necessary grades — although his SAT scores were satisfactory — to draw an offer. So he decided to attend prep school to preserve a year of his college eligibility.  Lucas visited Worcester Academy and quickly knew it was the place for him. He had a standout season for the Highlanders, got his grades in order and learned how to live on his own in a dorm setting.  “Everybody at the school did a great job and was very instrumental in my success in college and even now,” said Lucas, who went on to become a four-year letterman at Penn State before being drafted in the sixth round by the Dolphins in 2016.  The 6-1, 190-pound Lucas played sparingly in Miami, but has appeared in all 17 games and made five starts for KC. He’s collected 32 tackles and the first interception and sack of his career while playing about 25 percent of the snaps on defense and 50 percent on special teams.  Lucas made his first NFL start in the Chiefs’ 43-30 loss to the Patriots in Week 6 at Gillette Stadium. He made a career-high 10 tackles, broke up a pass and provided his typical jolt of juice in a wire-to-wire effort.  “I was just excited to be out there and, as you can see, I’m a high-energy guy,” Lucas said. “I love my teammates and love when they make plays. And I love to make plays and I’m going to let everybody know that while I’m out there on that field.  “That was all I tried to do that game and, of course, help us get the W. We didn’t get that and I’m thankful that we have another chance this weekend.”  And if the Chiefs make the most of their opportunity against the Patriots it could make for one hectic day for Jordan and Taylor Lucas on Super Bowl Sunday.  —Contact Rich Garven at rgarven@telegram.com.

# Recession Possibilities

In a down economy the natural instinct is to draw inward. Cut spending, slash budgets pull back initiatives and horde cash and resources. The problem with that approach is that a down economy may in fact be the best time to win by being creative. That means investing in creativity when the competition isn’t. When it comes to leveraging an investment in innovation and “Design Thinking” it requires an investment in not only capital but risk as well. To succeed by design in a down market not only will require the opposite of withdrawal but ad some risk thrown in for good measure. Experience suggests that all three elements are required to appear in abundance. When the formula is adhered to it almost never fails. Withdraw risk and reward opportunities are diminished. Without a creative approach risk is simple ill- advised. Too little of each creativity and risk and the return may not be worth the effort. Companies who slash investments in their Innovation efforts may find the damage to their long term interests far outweigh the short term money savings. After all the playing field in almost every industry is global now and the competition may not be withdrawing at all, in fact they may be investing. Every year there is a Conference held in California. The Technology, Entertainment and Design, or TED Conference. This year’s TED Conference sold out early. Perhaps the world’s most expensive Design gathering, which also expanded it’s capacity by changing venues, sold out in record time. Companies that are succeeding by leveraging design adhere to the counter intuitive notion that to innovate quickly we need to think long term. A long view is what allows capital to be aligned, efficiencies to occur and leadership to orchestrate efforts of diverse teams on diverse assignments. The failure of some recent business institutions dependent on tried and true methods is in many ways because they benefited the few. Design is a truly populist endeavor. Everyone benefits from the answers to problems created and made in ways that change the world around us meaningfully. Failure of old ways actually clears the path for creative thinking and new models. For example, companies are placing a new priority on achieving design solutions that reflect well on the earth and their business practices. Advantages in sustainability will create game changing opportunities. Every company that source reduces material and shrinks footprints etc…will on the one hand achieve some success in sustainable practice. On the other hand these positives may be hard to discern on shelf or in use, in fact in some cases may actually make it harder to sell or use, opening the door for truly creative re-inventions of existing paradigms. New use models, new sharing and return models etc…game changers instead of incremental improvement. When things aren’t going well sure, the first reaction generally is to take fewer chances not more. “Bold moves in bad times can pay-off big…a recession creates winners and losers just like a boom”. (Wharton Professor Mauro Guillen) Everyone will cut back on travel and freeze hiring; design is still going to be the differentiating factor after, but also during a recession. If sales as are harder to come by then the buying propositions presented need to be more compelling and design is the best way to do that. The job ahead is made additionally difficult by the kind of cultural hurdles that must be cleared to leverage creativity and design thinking to best advantage. Most businesses are set up with protocols, firewalls and policies designed to minimize risk. Sure it Ok for Google to allow their logo to be manipulated but that will never work for us. That kind of thinking won’t cut it in an economy down for the moment but with creativity differentiation and innovation at the core of its success or failure in the future. It can cost more to catch up in the long run.<end_of_turn>

# S/Africa: Malema's EFF launches election manifesto - Journal du Cameroun

South Africa’s third opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has launched its 2019 elections manifesto, pledging free education and land to youth and women if elected into office.According to the EFF, some 50 percent of the land would be owned by the youth and women while at least half of the country’s mineral resources would benefit locals, pledged party leader Julius Malema in Pretoria on Saturday.  In addition, Malema said the EFF had a particular focus on land reforms and job creation for the country’s millions of the unemployed.  According to the EFF manifesto, themed “Our Land and Jobs Now”, a “massive and protected sustainable industrial development” would be rolled out for the next five years to end the misery of the nine million unemployed South Africans should the party win the elections.  While all land in the republic would be in the custodianship of the state, a land ombudsman would be established to protect the rights of people to own land and prevent abuse from state officials and private companies.  As for those paying rent on residential land, they would be history when the red berets get state power since “the EFF government will abolish rentals on all residential land”.  Most of the land would be owned by black people, according to the EFF’s “demographically representative” land ownership policy and manifesto promise, while any ownership of land by foreign nationals would be abolished.  “We cannot postpone the land question. We cannot postpone the jobs question. We are hungry now, and we must eat now,” Malema said.<end_of_turn>

# Report: Investigators Say Suspect Arrested In Louisiana Church Burnings Has Ties To Black Metal Music

Report: Investigators Say Suspect Arrested In Louisiana Church Burnings Has Ties To Black Metal Music  April 11, 2019, an hour ago  ABC News is reporting that the suspect who was arrested in connection to three fires at black churches in Louisiana had ties to "black metal" music, investigators said Thursday.  Authorities apprehended Holden Matthews, 21, in St. Landry Parrish after they identified him as the suspect in allegedly setting the fires over a span of 10 days.  "We saw an immediate threat of public safety. We felt that other crimes were imminent," Louisiana State Fire Marshal "Butch" Browning.  Matthews is being held in St. Landry Parrish jail on three counts of simple arson of a religious building.  Browning said that "we're still vetting several motives," but added that they have found that Matthews had ties to "black metal and its association and history with church burnings in other parts of the world."  Black metal, a distant genre of devil-worshipping death metal music, has roots in the Norwegian heavy metal scene that reportedly was the inspiration for several church burnings in the country in the early 1990s.  Gov. John Bel Edwards said that while there were four fires in Louisiana in a 10-day span, only three were in St. Landry Parrish; the other fire was more than 220 miles away and was not connected, authorities said.  "I don't know what this young man's motive was... it cannot be justified or rationalized. These are evil acts," Edwards said.  Read more and watch a video report at ABC News.

# It's early days yet, but Rebel Cooper’s performance deserves some Cheika attention | IOL

CAPE TOWN – Former Wallabies and Reds fullback Greg Martin described Quade Cooper’s debut Super Rugby performance with the Rebels as “the most commanding flyhalf performance from an Australian in three years.”  The 70-Test Wallaby’s Super Rugby return was always going to be the main event in the Rebels’ opener against the Brumbies last week. And it turned out to be a brilliant one as Cooper guided the Rebels to a 34-27 win at Canberra Stadium.  If you look at the Rebels’ pivot struggles over the years, the 30-year-old’s efforts in round one should be welcomed even more.  But Cooper’s Canberra productions also sent a loud message to Australia coach Michael Cheika as well. Or at least it should have.  That was round one, so it’s still very, very early days. But after that performance, you can’t help but think World Cup, especially considering the Wallabies’ thin playmaking stocks.  And what a return that would be.  Cooper - along with Karmichael Hunt and James Slipper - was considered excess goods at Ballymore in 2018 and was exiled under Brad Thorne (although Cooper was the Reds’ only Super Rugby-winning playmaker).  He ended up playing third-tier club rugby in Brisbane, and now looks set to make up for lost time next to his long-time halfback partner Will Genia.  Going on that performance alone, the Rebels’ playmaking axis should be the one that steers Australia in Japan at the World Cup.  The Cooper-Genia halfback pairing is the third most capped partnership (71 games) in Super Rugby history, behind the Hurricanes’ TJ Perenara and Beauden Barrett (91) and former Brumbies duo George Gregan and Stephen Larkham (80).  They were also instrumental in the Reds’ Super Rugby-winning season in 2011. But the digits next to their names are far from the only factor that should speak in their favour when Cheika pencils his World Cup selections.  While Cooper showed a lot of his to-be-expected balling traits against the Brumbies - like that left-foot jink, flat play, stunning passing and a no-look give or two - it was also clear that he had worked on a thing or two while in the rugby wilderness.  He didn’t disappear in defence, in fact he looked quite eager and sturdy - like when he made that try-saving tackle on Wallaby steamtrain Tevita Kuridrani - while his kicking was pin-point and raked some good distance.  Genia was also impressive with his passing and kicking, and an added linebreak or two in addition to two try-assists made his outing a superb one.  That was on the individual front, but as a pair, there is no other partnership Down Under that can run the show like Cooper and Genia when they get it right.  And if they continue getting it right, Cheika will find himself having to explain why it isn’t Cooper starting alongside Genia in Japan as opposed to why he is giving the enigmatic flyhalf another chance. @WynonaLouw Cape Times<end_of_turn>

# Salaries of foreign spouses factored into total household income for eligibility of HDB grants

Salaries of foreign spouses factored into total household income for eligibility of HDB grants  There are non-citizen housing schemes, and HDB "exercises flexibility" in computing the loan amounts.  On Nov. 19, Member of Parliament (MP) Zainal Sapari asked the Minister for National Development if the income of a foreign spouse married to a Singaporean is taken into consideration by HDB in deciding the housing grant or loan that the applicant would be eligible for.  This is a pertinent question, as more than one in three citizen marriages last year involved “transnational couples”, according to the government’s Population in Brief 2018.  In other words, 35 per cent of the marriages involved a Singaporean citizen and a permanent resident or a foreigner.  Housing grants dependent on household income  Minister Lawrence Wong replied that housing grants are “means-tested” and “pegged to the monthly household income of all working members of the household”.  This means that the income of a foreign spouse is taken into consideration.  For instance, the grant quantum for the Additional CPF Housing Grant and Special CPF Housing Grant is tiered based on monthly household income.  Housing loans dependent on flat owners’ income  Regarding HDB loans, Wong stated that HDB determines the loan quantum based on the flat owners’ income. This is because they will be the ones servicing the mortgage.  However, Wong added that “HDB exercises flexibility and considers appeals to use the occupiers’ income for the computation of the loan amount on a case-by-case basis.”  HDB non-citizen schemes  HDB has non-citizen housing schemes for Built-To-Order (BTO) and resale flats.  BTO flats  For BTO and sale-of-balance flats, foreign spouses married to a Singaporean are only eligible for 2-Room Flexi flats in non-mature estates.  To be eligible for a grant, both citizen and spouse have to be employed at the time they submitted the flat application, and have been continuously employed for the 12 months prior to the flat application.  Resale  For resale flats, there are no restrictions on the size of flat that the couple can buy.  However, there will be some conditions that have to be met before the couple is eligible for grants.  This includes being a first-time applicants, and not having their average gross monthly household income exceed S$12,000.    Top photo composite image adapted via Gov.sg.<end_of_turn>

Witness Kylee Cordocedo was one of the first on the scene early Thursday morning.  “I saw my brother run towards Park Place with the guy on the ground; my sister in law said he was most likely shot, so I ran out there with a belt and a towel and just put pressure on (the wound) until the EMTs showed up.”  Cordocedo added while she doesn’t have any details about the person involved, she noted he was talking and conscious when emergency personnel arrived on scene and drove him to hospital.

# Devils’ Taylor Hall undergoes knee surgery | What it means

The Devils said Hall will begin rehab immediately, and he will be evaluate in the coming weeks to determine a return date. The team has 18 games left during 2018-19.  The injury has limited him to just 33 games this season. Hall missed two games in mid-December before returning for four more games, but he last appeared in a game on Dec. 23. Hall has been working out and rehabbing in New Jersey in an effort to avoid surgery since last playing. During his rehab, Hall has intermittently skated on his own, but he was usually restricted to off-ice work. The Devils never gave any indication he was close to making the next step to on-ice activities with teammates. The surgery marked the second time in three seasons with the Devils that Hall had surgery on his left knee. He underwent a procedure to repair a torn meniscus on Nov. 16, 2016. He missed only eight games following that procedure, returning to the lineup on Dec. 1, 2016. if Hall has another quick turnaround, there’s always the possibility he plays during the final five weeks of this season.  But given his already lengthy absence and the seemingly extra precautions the Devils have taken to make sure Hall is 100 percent healthy when he returns to the lineup, there is a chance he does not return to the lineup this season.  If Hall doesn’t play again this season, his attention will turn to the summer, where he will be eligible to sign a contract extension for up to eight years with the Devils after July 1. If he does not sign an extension, he will enter the final year of his contract in 2019-20 before potentially becoming an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2020.<end_of_turn>

# MP Fiona Onasanya recall petition opens

Fiona Onasanya: Recall petition opens in Peterborough  A recall petition has been opened in Peterborough to decide whether MP Fiona Onasanya will keep her seat. The petition will be available for constituents to sign over the next six weeks, closing at 17:00 BST on 1 May. Ms Onasanya, 35, was jailed for three months in January for perverting the course of justice after lying about a speeding offence. She will face a by-election if 10% of her constituents - about 7,000 people - sign the petition. The process began on 5 March when Peterborough City Council received a letter from the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, giving them 10 days to put the petition in place. It is available to sign in 10 different venues across the city - but only by eligible Peterborough constituents. Ms Onasanya was dismissed from the Labour Party in December and remains an independent MP. In a YouTube video posted on Monday, she protested her innocence and vowed to be a "voice of change in Parliament". Gillian Beasley, chief executive of Peterborough City Council, described organising the petition as "a massive operation". She said 13,000 postal signing papers had been issued, and 57,000 letters sent to constituents informing them of the process. "It's something we've never done before; we've spent a lot of time putting together a project plan, we've sent out letters and set up signing places," she said. Signatures will be counted at the end of the six-week period, and the total figure returned to the Speaker, who will then approve publication of the results. It is the first time a recall petition has been held in England since the Recall of MPs Act - allowing voters to formally remove their MP - came into force in 2016. Last September, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley survived a recall petition after he failed to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.<end_of_turn>

# ‘It’s huge for us’: Banks HS makes history, wins championships in 3 sports

BANKS, OR (KPTV) – Banks High School is making history as the second school in the state to win championships in football, basketball and baseball, all in the same year. The Braves this year took home their first-ever football title, a basketball crown, and now, a 4A baseball state title. Just last weekend, the boys played at Volcanoes Stadium in Keizer and walked out winners over Henley High School from Klamath Falls. The final score was three to one. Last fall, it was a huge celebration the night the Banks High School football team clinched the victory over Seaside at state. The smallest 4A school in Oregon felt like the biggest when they won their first-ever football title. It’s also the first-ever state title for Duck alum and Banks alum Coach Cole. “I was on all three teams,” Hayden Vandehey, a Banks High School student, said. “I was QB for football, guard for basketball and shortstop and pitcher for baseball. It’s unreal, coming into senior year, we just wanted one state victory to put Banks in the history books, we’ve been so close for so long. To finally come through for our town and community and every Banks Brave – it’s huge for us. “I’m honored and proud of this team and this year,” Blake Gobel, another student, said. “We’re going down in history here – it’s really sweet. It’s cool.” Many of the students say they have played sports together since grade school. According to the Oregon School Activities Association, the last school in the state to snag a triple crown of state titles in football, baseball and basketball was North Valley High School in Grants Pass, and that was back in 1985.

# SLHES fourth-graders stage their own wax museum

SPRING LAKE HEIGHTS — Students and parents filled Spring Lake Heights Elementary School’s media center on Friday, May 31 for the fourth annual Wax Museum hosted by the fourth-grade class.  The event featured students dressed up as historical figures, athletes and activists. Some figures included Abraham Lincoln, Elizabeth Blackwell, Malala, Stan Lee, Misty Copeland, Steve Irwin, etc.  “They can find anyone who has made an impact on society … it’s people that they are interested in,” said fourth-grade teacher, Francesca Preston. “And that’s why I think their work is so good, because they’re really passionate about what they are doing.” Student Dylan Carnahan researched and dressed up as Bethany Hamilton, a surfer who survived a shark attack in 2003. Her costume even included a life-size replica of a surfboard with a shark bite taken out of it.  “I’m a surfer, too so she really inspires me,” Dylan said. “When she was 13 years old she was bitten by a shark and got right back on the board.”  This is an excerpt of the print article.

# Cool Technologies Announces Initial Purchase Order to Launch Joint Venture With Turkish Multi-National BelirtiTech

Cool Technologies Announces Initial Purchase Order to Launch Joint Venture With Turkish Multi-National BelirtiTech  JV to sell and distribute the CoolTech’s Mobile Generation technology in the Middle East  TAMPA, Fla., June  06, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cool Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: WARM), an innovator in efficient mobile electric power generation and power enhancement technologies for motors and generators, announced today that it has entered into a joint venture agreement (“JV”) with Turkish technology company Belirti Teknoloji, A.S. (“BelirtiTech”).  To launch the business, BelirtiTech has awarded Cool Technologies a purchase order for up to $42 million USD for the purchase of several different models of its Mobile Generation kits.  The purchase order will supply the JV with its initial inventory for resale into the Middle East and some African nations. The Company is actively working with the customer’s bank in addition to insurance companies and other financial entities to facilitate the financing of the orders. “CoolTech’s Mobile Generation technology is needed throughout the region. Power is inconsistent, infrastructure not well developed, and water supplies are dwindling. We haven’t found any other technology that brings so much commercial grade power to the field or to a work site with as much mobility, flexibility and ease,” noted BelirtiTech Founder and Managing Partner Mehmet Kunter.  BelirtiTech, founded in 1987 in Istanbul, Turkey, is an engineering company that combines different technologies to develop turn-key solutions and products that serve many markets including geophysical exploration, soil investigation, groundwater investigation, and drilling.  “BelirtiTech has deep connections throughout the Middle East. We fully expect that this will lead to additional opportunities for the Company as we expand production and capacity with our OEM partners,” said Timothy Hassett, Cool Technologies’ Chairman and CEO. “We have specifically chosen OEM partners that have an international presence and can provide full supply chain support, including logistics, inventory, warehousing and service.”  This initial purchase order is for six hundred MG80, MG125 and MG200 Mobile Generation systems. The MG systems will be integrated into the end customer’s choice of vehicles. The systems output commercial grade power, both single and three phase, standby and prime, across a variety of voltages. With an MG system, users no longer a need to tow a generator. They can plug right into the truck and output up to 200 kilovolt amps of electric power. The in-chassis generator enables users to tow additional equipment and reach sites that might be inaccessible while towing a trailered generator.  Management expects that the financing negotiations with banks, customers and other entities will enable the Company to begin production of the systems within the 3rd quarter of 2019, and to generate revenues from the sales by the end of the year. The Company currently has inventory in place to start the initial first article production build.  The purchase order also includes an additional MG80 installed in a Ford F-450 with the 2,500 gallon per day Mobile Water Desalinization option included.  About Cool Technologies, Inc.  Cool Technologies is an intellectual property and product development company commercializing patented thermal dispersion technology across multiple platforms. The Company has additional patents-pending for various OEM applications of its proprietary heat removal technologies. Tested and validated by two third parties, ESSCO Pumps and Nidec Corporation, the Company’s cooling system eliminates the need for costly and maintenance heavy cooling systems while increasing power output of motors, generators, pumps, fans, compressors, batteries and bearings.
