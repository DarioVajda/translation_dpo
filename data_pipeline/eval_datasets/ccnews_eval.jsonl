Latino fears in the wake of Prop. 187, which sought to keep the undocumented immigrant out of public schools, hospital emergency rooms and seemingly any place its authors could imagine, led to citizenship applications and then voter registration by more than 2.5 million Hispanics over the next three years. They caused a political revolution in California, which morphed from a swing state equally likely to elect Republicans or Democrats into one of the most staunchly Democratic states in the Union. Only one Republican has been elected to statewide office in the last 20 years, the almost non-partisan former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who won out in the 2003 recall of ex-Gov. Gray Davis. Now Asian immigrants are feeling fearful because of President Trump’s ban on entry to this country by residents of several Muslim-majority countries and his attempts to restrict the number of political and humanitarian refugees allowed in, plus a drive to deport Vietnamese refugees with any kind of crime on their record, no matter how old or minor. Asians also remember the Japanese internment during World War II, in which 120,000 Japanese-Americans were held in remote camps for several years. “You hope things like that can’t happen again, but they really can,” said one green card holder from Thailand. “So I will become a citizen.” Like her, thousands of Asians in California, from countries as diverse as China, the Philippines and India, see citizenship as the best protection from a potential future expulsion. If they become citizens in anything like the proportions of Latinos who felt similarly in California after passage of Prop. 187, they could spur vast political changes well beyond this state’s borders. In fact, if both they and citizenship-eligible Latino immigrants ever register in large numbers, they could turn several once-solid Republican states into battlegrounds or cause them to lean Democratic. And Asians here are applying, although there are impediments Latinos did not face in the late 1990s. Example: Of the 220,000 immigrants in Orange County now eligible for naturalization, nearly 30 percent are Asian. Of them, about 4,500 applied for naturalization through the first three quarters of 2017. If that trend continues statewide for the remainder of Trump’s current term, more than 150,000 Asians will be added to California’s voting rolls. Because they’re registering largely for the same reasons as Latinos once did, they probably won’t change this state’s political composition. But what about other states? Taking Texas as an example, more than 680,000 Asians are now eligible for citizenship but have not applied. That could make for big change in a state that in November almost gave a Democrats their first statewide victory in more than 20 years. Yes, the $725 naturalization application fee is a roadblock for many. So is the required blizzard of paperwork. But Texas saw more than 20,000 citizenship applications from Asians last year. If Latinos, many even more apprehensive about Trump’s policies than Asians, register in Texas in similar percentages – and they have not yet – they could combine with Asians to turn Texas Democratic. For that state contains more than 3 million Hispanics who have not sought naturalization despite being eligible. For sure, the numbers indicate fear among both Latinos and Asians has not reached the same levels it did among California Hispanics after Prop. 187. But what happens when and if Trump begins serious work on his long-advertised border wall? And what if he attempts mass deportations of illegal immigrants, as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions advocated during his days in the Senate? For sure, hate crimes against immigrants of all kinds increased during Trump’s presidential campaign and his first year in office. If that trend accelerates, it may spur the kind of fears that pushed Latinos to get naturalized here. Isaac Newton’s third law of motion tells us that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Just as former President Obama’s policies produced the backlash that elected Trump, so Trump’s policies may already have begun producing an even stronger national backlash against him and his party.", "published_date": "2018-12-31", "title": "Thomas D.

In 2019, we can make more progress together.  For me, that starts with recommitting to strategies that will combat the opioid epidemic, which has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of teenagers and young adults. Evidence-based prevention education and robust mental health and substance use treatment save lives, and it’s time to get all young people get the services and support they need.  The prevention education program my office launched with the GE Foundation is now available to every middle school in Massachusetts, but that’s just one important step. We’re continuing our lawsuit against Purdue Pharma to make sure our next generation can grow up safe and healthy. And we’re taking on the e-cigarette industry, which is following the Big Tobacco playbook by targeting young people in our schools.  This year, I’m also going to continue our efforts to combat climate change and advance the clean energy revolution in Massachusetts. Young people have reminded us again and again — and even gone to court to show us — that their future and the future of this planet is at stake. Whether it’s working for more efficient cars or cleaner power plants, we’ll be there in 2019.  Finally, since the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., last February, young people all across the country have organized in unprecedented numbers for common sense gun safety reforms. No student should have to interrupt math class for an active shooter drill or feel unsafe walking home from class. I’m inspired by their leadership and promise them that in Massachusetts we’ll keep defending our strong gun laws and partnering with students, survivors of violence, and law enforcement on the reforms we need.

{"requested_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwagner/2018/12/31/as-a-new-year-begins-the-bucks-have-the-nbas-best-record/", "plain_text": "Regardless of what happens during the New Years' Eve slate of games on the National Basketball Association, the Milwaukee Bucks will begin 2019 with the league's best record.  Sure, there's still way too much basketball remaining before anyone can even think of pulling the crown of the Golden State Warriors' collective heads and absolutely, an uneven number of games played and percentage points have helped the Bucks to this accomplishment, but there's no denying that Milwaukee is in the midst of a special season and regardless of the circumstance, the accomplishment is a point of pride for those in the locker room.  \"It means a lot,\" forward Giannis Antetokounmpo said of Milwaukee's success so far. \"This is my first time playing on a team that's No. 1. This is a first for me and I'm pretty sure it is for those guys, as well.\"  \"But at the same time ... we're not satisfied.\"  They've complied some pretty impressive wins along the way, opening the season with seven in a row -- including a 124-109 rout of then-undefeated Toronto -- to open the season. They went into Golden State and crushed the Warriors, 134-111, in early November then pummeled Portland by 43 just a few weeks later.    In all, the Bucks have won 17 games by at least 10 points, six by at least 20, three by at least 30 and one by at least 40. Their 8.9-points per game differential ranks first in the league, one of several categories Milwaukee leads this season.   To be fair, there have been a handful of stinkers in Milwaukee's 10 losses, most notably a 116-114 home loss to lowly Phoenix on Nov. 23 and more recently, a 94-87 stumble at Miami in which the Bucks scored all of eight points in the opening quarter.  But it's in those losses that the Bucks' real progress and evolution is most visible. More specifically, it's after those losses, as each of the 10 was followed by a victory. A year ago, the Bucks dropped consecutive games on nine separate occasions and were 22-14 in games following losses.  Giannis Antetokounmpo chalks Milwaukee's ability to bounce back as another sign of progress under Mike Budenholzer, who was hired over the summer to take over a team whose development had stagnated under the guidance of Jason Kidd.  \"I was watching clips of me from previous years ... looking for ways to get better and what I'm doing differently now,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"What stuck in my head was no matter what I was doing in the game, at the end, we were losing.  \"That kind of hurt me. I was like 'man, why are we losing?'. It kind of hurt because this year, we're winning. When you lose, it's a bad feeling. I don't like that bad feeling and as a team we don't like that bad feeling. That's why we don't lose twice in a row; whenever we lose, we just try to play better as a team and get back on track. That's really what a winning team does. When you lose, you can let your emotions take over and start playing bad and bad ... but we just try to get back on track, playing as a team and get better.\"  When asked how the Bucks have been able to do that, Antetokounmpo paused for a moment then, in a fashion those who have followed him and the Bucks closely over the last few years, came up with the perfect Giannis-esque analogy.  \"When you start drinking Coca-Cola, you don't like drinking generic cola; you don't want to go back,\" said Antetokounmpo -- who for the record has yet to land a soft drink endorsement. \"I think that's it. When you start winning, you don't like going back to losing.\"  It that seems overly simplistic, it's not. Eric Bledsoe noted that not only have the Bucks not lost back-to-back games all year, they also haven't lost to the same opponent twice, something he chalks up to an improved level of focus.  \"The focus is there and you can tell,\" Bledsoe said. \"We're having fun and we're relaxed so if we stay like that, everything will be fine.  \"We're going to lose games That's the nature of the game. But we can't get down on ourselves; there's always another game. We can sulk over losing or why we lost, we just have to keep moving forward and keep bringing the great energy we've been brining. As long as we do that, everything will take care of itself.\"  Whatever the reason for the improvement, Budenholzer isn't complaining. Having led good teams himself, and as a longtime assistant under Gregg Popovich in San Antonio, he's seen plenty of good -- even great teams -- and one of their hallmarks has been an ability to contain their losses.  \"Those are the high-character, the really highly-competitive teams ... when they've lost a game, they don't let it happen again,\" Budenholzer said. \"When you see one of those teams on your schedule, you don't want to be the team that plays them after they've lost.  \"I don't know that we're there yet but it's certainly a quality we want to have in us.\" I’ve spent the better part of the last two decades covering sports in Wisconsin for a variety of print, broadcast and online outlets. I’ve been on the Brewers and Bucks beats regularly since 2003 and for the last seven years, I’ve been a Milwaukee correspondent for The Sport...

{"requested_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/arts/pete-davidson-return-standup.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "plain_text": "MEDFORD, Mass. — The comedian Pete Davidson returned to the stage Monday night, two weeks after an Instagram post raised concerns that he was having suicidal thoughts, and showed that his preferred coping mechanism was still intact: laughter. Delivering a rough and raucous stand-up set, Mr. Davidson, 25, a “Saturday Night Live” cast member, also sought to move past his ill-fated engagement to the pop star Ariana Grande. He staged two sold-out shows, one in Boston and one in the neighboring suburb of Medford, in what were his first public performances since the Instagram post two weeks ago in which he stated that he really didn’t “want to be on this earth anymore.” The post prompted the New York Police Department to dispatch an officer to the Manhattan studios of “S.N.L.” for a wellness check, and Mr. Davidson did not appear in any sketches on that week’s show, the last of the year. (Mr. Davidson is expected to return to “S.N.L.” in January, according to a person familiar with the show’s plans who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.) The performance in Boston was called “Pete Davidson and Friends,” and the title was apt. Mr. Davidson made clear that he had been getting by with a little help from them — and the uproarious applause of thousands of exuberant fans on Monday night probably didn’t hurt. Mr. Davidson, wearing an oversize hooded jacket and sweatpants, ambled to the microphone with a beer in hand after four fellow comics, all close friends, delivered crisp sets. Mr. Davidson’s set started slow and discursive — he suggested that in addition to his usual “flagrant” marijuana smoking, he had ingested psychedelic mushrooms earlier in the day — but he steadily found his stride. After covering several of his comedic staples, including his penchant for marijuana, Mr. Davidson turned to a subject that the audience clearly had on its mind: his breakup with Ms. Grande. “When you get dumped,” Mr. Davidson said, pausing as the audience began to cheer. “I’ll stop if you’re going to be stupid.” Mr. Davidson then offered an intimate glimpse into what life has been like for a kid from Staten Island, with friends he described as “goons,” to be engaged to and then dumped by one of the most famous pop stars in the world. Mr. Davidson told of how his mother, a school nurse, was taunted by a student singing Ms. Grande’s song “thank u, next,” which was inspired in part by the breakup. When the school’s dean heard this, Mr. Davidson said, the student was summoned to his office and made to sing in front of four administrators — “retired cops with mustaches.” His post breakup experience, Mr. Davidson said, “showed me how ugly people can get but also how cool.” The performance marked a return to form. In December, Mr. Davidson, who has been candid about his struggles with mental illness, alluded to intense online bullying in the wake of the breakup. On Dec. 15, he posted: “I’m doing my best to stay here for you but I actually don’t know how much longer I can last. All I’ve ever tried to do was help people. Just remember I told you so.” His Instagram account was subsequently deleted. After Mr. Davidson’s performance in Medford on Monday, audience members said they were pleased to see him back on his feet — and to view another side of him. “I think we can be a little bit more on Pete’s side,” said Megan Samec, 22, referring to the split with Ms. Grande. “We’re going to root for you in this case.” Jack Beauchamp, 23, pointed out that the relationship with Ms. Grande accounted for only part of Mr. Davidson’s material. “That was maybe a fraction of the show,” he said. “Everyone knows him as the ‘S.N.L.’ guy. This was really him trying to show who he was as a comic.”", "published_date": "2019-01-01", "title": "Pete Davidson Back on Stage for First Time Since Suicide Scare", "tags": "Comedy and Humor;Davidson, Pete (1993- );Saturday Night Live (TV Program);Mental Health and Disorders", "categories": "Arts", "author": "Ted Siefer", "sitename": "NYTimes", "image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/01/arts/01davidson1/01davidson1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9865009784698486, "responded_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/arts/pete-davidson-return-standup.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "publisher": "nytimes.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101042830-00057.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-01T06:07:31+00:00"}

They will also be presented with a flag and a copy of the preamble of the UN Charter to keep.  It is part of the Global Ireland strategy that is being launched by Tanaiste Simon Coveney.  The Foreign Minister is also unveiling details of seven new embassies that will open this year to help Irish citizens abroad. Mr Coveney said: “This is about getting young people interested in Ireland’s global interests.  “We’ve tested the appetite for this in schools by the way and it is extraordinary how young people respond to speaking to a peacekeeper about their experiences in the Lebanon, or in Mali, or wherever they’ve been based.  “And obviously talking to a diplomat as well about what Ireland does outside the confines of this island.”  New consular missions have opened in Canada, New Zealand and Liberia in recent months.  The continuing programme will see the rollout of seven more over the next year in India, Colombia, Chile, Jordan, Wales, the US and Germany.  Mr Coveney added: “While cognizant of the immense challenges our country faces with Brexit, it is critical we plan for our future and embrace the enormous opportunities for Ireland all over the world.  “Huge work is already under way and we will build new partnerships with countries where we do not have official representation and deepen our existing partnerships by opening new embassies and strengthening our current network.  “We will strengthen the way Ireland’s embassies and our key economic, trade, and scientific Agencies work together to deliver ‘Global Ireland’.”  How to follow the Irish Mirror on social media  You can like our main Facebook page here.

Pune: Thousands of people have visited the ‘Jay Stambh’, a war memorial, in Maharashtra’s Koregaon Bhima village on January 1 to mark the 201st anniversary of the 1818 battle between the British and the Peshwas. The administration has stepped up security to avoid the repeat of last year’s violence that broke out between Dalits and right-wing groups and marred the bicentennial celebration.  According to reports, at least 20,000 police personnel, including 5,000 police personnel, 1,200 Home Guards and 12 companies of the Rapid Action Force and the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) have been deployed in and around the war memorial.  Besides large-scale police deployment, 500 CCTV cameras, 11 drone cameras and 40 video cameras have also been put in place to monitor the area.  Maharashtra police has also denied permission to a number of religious leaders and groups for visiting the village and externed 64 people and booked 1,211 people under preventive action.  Those who have been prohibited from visiting Koregaon Bhima and the surrounding area, 40 km from Pune, include right-wing Hindu leader Milind Ekbote and members of the left-leaning cultural group Kabir Kala Manch (KKM).  According to District collector Ram, seven to ten lakh people are expected to visit the war memorial today.  On Monday, Dalit leader and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad reiterated his plan to visit the victory pillar even if the government uses force to deter him.  Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of Dalit icon BR Ambedkar, also visited the memorial today.  Amidst heavy security, an event was organised at midnight to commemorate 201 years of the battle. Thousands of visitors paid their tribute at the memorial and a special 'puja' was also organised during the night.  Dalits, who look upon the defeat of Peshwa's army as a symbol of their emancipation, visit the Jay Stambh (victory pillar) at the site on January 1 every year.

In a replay of last year's final, defending champion Kyrgios unleashed 44 aces to progress to the second round with a 7-6, 5-7, 7-6 victory over two hours and eight minutes on Pat Rafter Arena. The world number 35 spent part of the off-season in hospital recovering from a spider bite and the rest of the time staying as far away from a tennis court as possible. Earlier in the week, he suggested he might come up with 30 unforced errors and may just take the year off if he jagged the Australian Open title. He conceded he was rusty, particularly from the baseline, but hardly looked like a player that wasn't interested in hanging around for the rest of the week. In a tense, exceedingly tight affair, Kyrgios kept his calm and rode his elite serve towards a second round meeting with Frenchman Jeremy Chardy. \"Just considering how much I hit during the off season and to still get through is pretty impressive. I mean, my serve is always something that I know that I can go back on, and today it came through again,\" Kyrgios said. \"I knew I wasn't going to play great, but obviously, again, my serve got through. Hopefully my level of tennis improves a little bit though.\" If Kyrgios sought to play down expectations ahead of defending the title he won here last year, then the rise of fellow Australians has been able to help his cause. For the first time in a while, Kyrgios is no longer the only storyline worth writing about in the Australian men's draw. The rise and rise of Alex De Minaur, who enters the home summer as Australia's highest ranked male player, has not only pleased Kyrgios as a friend but served to shift some of the spotlight - and in turn, pressure - to another athlete. John Millman's heroics against Roger Federer at the US Open was one of the best feel-good stories of 2018. He's a hometown hero in his native Brisbane and already booked his spot in the second round with victory on the opening night. All three are ranked in the 30s (De Minaur 31, Kyrgios 35 and Millman 38) and while Kyrgios has the added expectation of being the defending champion, all three have been expected to fire in front of their home fans. Kyrgios has welcomed the company closer to the top of the ATP charts but still feels he's the main attraction over coming weeks. \"I mean, I don't know if the spotlight is off of me. I was practicing the other day, I had 13 cameras on my court; had a spider bite, that seemed to be the biggest story over the Aussie summer,\" said Kyrgios, who perhaps hasn't flicked through to the cricket pages. \"So let's don't act as if attention is not on me. But, yeah, obviously it does help having guys like that winning matches. I don't know if the spotlight has shifted at all.\"", "published_date": "2019-01-01", "title": "Spiders and Ryan Harrison can't stop Nick Kyrgios in 2019 opener", "tags": "", "categories": "Tennis", "author": "Phil Lutton", "sitename": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "image_url": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3724969982451279,$multiply_1,$ratio_1.776846,$width_1059,$x_307,$y_285/t_crop_custom/w_800/t_sharpen,q_auto,f_auto/063b22fbde18e3b47ba3c0a32c60c643e8eeeaa8", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9836105108261108, "responded_url": "https://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/spiders-and-ryan-harrison-can-t-stop-nick-kyrgios-in-2019-opener-20190101-p50p4p.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_feed", "publisher": "smh.com.au", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101042830-00057.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-01T09:07:28+00:00"}

He has been training with West Ham and there is an option to extend his stay beyond the end of the season.  “I am very pleased to welcome Samir to West Ham United,” Pellegrini said on whufc.com. “He is a player I obviously know well from our time together at Manchester City and I am happy to be working with him again.  “He has been working very hard here in recent weeks to build up his fitness and condition after a long period without playing, and he is now very determined to return to his best.”  Nasri is a two-time Premier League winner, having won the trophy with City in 2011-12 and 2013-14, the latter season under Pellegrini.  “Coming back to the most competitive league in the world, with a team full of ambition with a manager that I know, it’s the best job in the world and I’m really excited about it,” Nasri said.", "published_date": "2019-01-01", "title": "Samir Nasri completes move to West Ham as doping ban ends", "tags": "samir nasri, nasri, doping ban, nasri ban, west ham, football news, football transfer, indian express", "categories": "", "author": "AP", "sitename": "The Indian Express", "image_url": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/01/samir-nasri-759.jpg?w=759", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9800636172294617, "responded_url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/english-premier-league/samir-nasri-completes-move-to-west-ham-as-doping-ban-ends-5518415/", "publisher": "indianexpress.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101042830-00057.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-01T09:27:07+00:00"}

{"requested_url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/why-the-pentagon-bought-romania-a-cheap-and-cheerful-hatchback-1.1189277", "plain_text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nobody at the Pentagon can quite figure out why U.S. taxpayers bought a Dacia Sandero Stepway 2 for the Romanian defense ministry, but it’s apparently one of those things allies do to smooth relations. It’s a mystery because the Dacia isn’t a fighter jet, a missile system or a tank. It’s a small hatchback, described by one auto reviewer as “cheap and cheerful.” Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who departed his job with the arrival of the new year, approved the U.S. Navy spending $2.9 million from a fund for “extraordinary expenses” to pay local contractors for construction of a perimeter road around a base in Romania that houses the U.S.’s top ground-based missile defense site in Europe -- and to foot the bill for the car along the way. ‘International Relations’ “I believe that the payment will avoid harm to international relations between the U.S. and Romania as well as adverse public opinion,” Mattis wrote defense lawmakers in October to inform them that the previously undisclosed expenditure would be made on Nov. 19. Former Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord said in an email that it’s “unusual, regardless of funding source, I believe, to use U.S. funds to buy a vehicle for a host nation on host nation soil, as opposed to the more understandable case where we might buy a vehicle to support a coalition partner in a theater of operations like Afghanistan.” The payment to Romania’s Ministry of National Defense covered funds that Navy personnel with U.S. Naval Forces-Europe-Africa headquarters in Naples, Italy, erroneously obligated in 2016 and 2017 without proper authority. Payment was stopped before those funds were transferred. The Romanian payment is little more than a rounding error for a department responsible for the lion’s share of the $716 billion national security budget that Congress approved for this fiscal year. Yet it demonstrates the sometimes small and mundane steps that Mattis has taken to strengthen bonds with allies, in this case a NATO member that hosts a key U.S. weapons system. In his resignation letter to President Donald Trump, Mattis indicated the president has slighted those relations, writing that “our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships.” Perimeter Road The $2.9 million went primarily for work to design and construct a 12.4-kilometer (7.7-mile) perimeter road at the Deveselu military base in southern Romania. It’s occupied jointly by Navy support personnel and Romanian forces and is the site of the U.S. Aegis Ashore Missile Defense installation intended to intercept Iranian missiles fired at Europe. Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon referred comment to the Navy. Captain John Perkins, a spokesman for the command in Naples, said in an email that officials last year asked the navy secretary to approve the funds using the service’s “emergency and extraordinary expense authority as the appropriate means to make this payment” because “the perimeter road will help Romanian forces provide better external security” for the base. Mattis said in his letter that contractors in Romania “who are executing the project have pursued legal action for payment against the Romanian Ministry of Defense.” To contact the reporter on this story: Tony Capaccio in Washington at acapaccio@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Larry Liebert, Joshua Gallu ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.", "published_date": "2019-01-01", "title": "Why the Pentagon Bought Romania a ‘Cheap and Cheerful’ Hatchback - BNN Bloomberg", "tags": "Company News;Investing", "categories": "Bloomberg", "author": "Bloomberg News", "sitename": "BNN", "image_url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9526325464248657, "responded_url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/why-the-pentagon-bought-romania-a-cheap-and-cheerful-hatchback-1.1189277", "publisher": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101042830-00057.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-01T09:48:54+00:00"}

This will take the total number of territorial police stations in Delhi to 178 and police districts to 15. Amulya Patnaik, Delhi Police commissioner, said the new district, to be known as ‘Outer North’ district, will help keep a better check on the city’s borders near Rohini. The new ‘Outer North’ district has been formed by carving out of the existing Rohini, North-West and Outer districts. The police stations under the jurisdiction of the Outer North district are Narela, Narela Industrial Area, Alipur, Samai Pur Badli, Bawana, Shahbad Dairy, Swaroop Nagar and Bhalswa Dairy. These will be under four sub-divisions. “Some of those areas are along the border. A DCP-level supervision of those border areas will be more effective in curbing crimes,” said Patnaik. The new police stations are spread across the capital. In the southern part of Delhi, Tigri and Maidan Garhi will start functioning under the south district while Shaheen Bagh and Kalindi Kunj will come up in south-east district. In east district, the new police stations have been named Patparganj Industrial Area and Shakarpur. In north-east district, the new stations are Shastri Park and Dayalpur. There already was a police station named Shakarpur in east Delhi. That has now be renamed as Laxmi Nagar, said a statement issued by Delhi Police on Tuesday. The other new police stations to start functioning from Tuesday are Prem Nagar and Budh Vihar in Rohini district, Mohan Garden in Dwarka district, Raj Park in Outer District, Narela Industrial Area in Outer North district, Wazirabad in North district and Kishangarh in South-West district. The police chief said the need for new police stations was felt as some stations were finding it difficult to handle the workload and curb crimes. “Certain areas of Delhi were very big, jurisdiction-wise. With the creation of the new police stations, the visibility and presence of the police will be better,” said Patnaik. Patnaik said 7,500 new recruits are expected to pass out in a month and ease the burden on the force. On an average, 674 cases have been registered every day in the national capital till November 30 this year, figures by the Delhi Police show.

They’re at home with the kids.\" We know this model too well – it enables men to have flourishing careers while not worrying about their \"caring responsibilities”, as former prime minister John Howard once put it, which inevitably fall to women. There are many families in which this works, save for the 46,000 people who divorced in 2016, according to the Bureau of Statistics. Those people, that is the women, will likely find themselves severely shortchanged. To follow Banks' advice, “I believe all women should ... ensure their financial independence\". And yet, I still hear young women commenting that life would be so much easier if they married a rich man. Here are five reasons why women need a better plan: Independence means choice Money can’t buy you happiness, but it can buy you choices. Financial independence means you can choose to leave an unhappy relationship, or an unsafe one. Without it, you could find yourself among the alarmingly rising number of over-55 women seeking support for homelessness. But it’s not all consequences, there are benefits too. Financial independence means you can choose the right job and feel secure enough to say \"no\" when it doesn’t suit you. You can buy or rent the right house, in the suburb that’s right for you. Want to stop work and study? Sure! It’ll just take some of those savings you’ve tucked away to get you there. Love doesn't always last As much as we’d like them to, relationships don’t last forever, so good planning goes a long way. In 2016, the second-largest peak for divorce was in the 40-49 age group, after many women have children. The time out from the workforce to have those babies comes with a financial sting. The 2017 HILDA survey found Australian women retired with an average super balance of $230,907, just half that of men. While this is also due to the gender pay gap, it’s compounded by years out of the workforce. And the money doesn't stretch far. In fact, it’ll leave you struggling on $600 a week including the age pension, only a mere $160 above the poverty line. Worse still, one in three women retired with nothing (yes, you read right). No super at all, according to a 2016 Senate report that tactfully stated “a husband is not a retirement plan”. Indeed, they aren't. The workforce gap dents more than your resume Imagine yourself as a hiring manager sifting through the resumes that come across your desk. When you compare resumes with gaping holes side by side with those of people who have been in the job market consistently, the latter usually wins out, especially without quotas or a supportive leadership team to back your decision to step away from work. As a candidate, it's not just your resume that takes the brunt of the burden, because the longer you spend out of the workforce, the harder it is to get back in. There is also pressure from employers to keep up your skills, and that can also dent your confidence and therefore the ability to land the right role and negotiate the best pay. There’s no gender pay gap with investments While there’s a gender pay gap with almost everything, pay, super, and of course a \"pink tax\" on female consumer goods – investments don’t discriminate. You’ll be paid the same returns whether you’re a woman or a man. And anyone can do it. Whether you choose to buy some stocks yourself, or use a financial adviser – you can attain equal access to financial investments. After all, the ultimate goal of financial independence is to have passive income, and building an investment portfolio is a smart way to do it. Interdependence Imagine being in a relationship where someone has all the power over you. It’s a situation we’d never recommend to our daughters, yet it’s one so many women find themselves in. Money is power. And when you don’t have your own savings or accounts, asking your partner for money for something as small as getting your hair done can quickly turn into, “Can I get my hair done?” and feeling the need to justify it.

The six short works are selected from independent stages in Montreal or the Canadian festival circuit, and presented under one roof from Jan. 8 to 20. Eda Holmes, artistic director of the Centaur, said she can't wait to show audiences what the festival has in store. With shows running between 45 to 75 minutes long, and tickets ranging between $13 and $16 — festival-goers are encouraged to take in a double-feature, and see a couple of shows a night. This year, the festival features four homegrown productions and two Toronto imports, one of which was nominated for the Centaur's Best English Production Award at the Montreal Fringe Festival. That show, Crime After Crime, is the brainchild of the beloved Sex T-Rex sketch comedy troupe, who have earned stellar reviews the last few years they've been at Montreal Fringe. Their latest production serves as a parody of police procedural series, film noir and classic heist movies. \"Their show is really fun and eccentric and great,\" said Holmes. Another show that garnered a lot of buzz during its initial run at the Mainline Theatre in August is Sapientia, a play written by history's first recorded female playwright. Hroswitha of Gandersheim wrote a play in the Middle Ages about three allegorical virgins who are put to death. \"It's all about three sisters ... who are going to be sacrificed for their Christianity,\" said Holmes. \"And they're all played by teacups.\" Sapientia, produced by local theatre company Scapegoat Carnivale, uses everyday objects like tea cups and an espresso machine to retell this story. \"They take classic texts and do incredible, modern contemporary things with them,\" said Holmes. The show won the Montreal English Theatre Award (META) for Outstanding Independent Production in 2018. Body So Fluorescent is a one-woman show, co-created and starring Amanda Cordner, about a black woman who imagines what her life would be like as a white gay man. \"All the pieces in Wildside this year deal with transformation in one form or another,\" said Holmes. \"She goes through this kind of club trance world into becoming this other person and experiencing the world through their eyes.\" The play, which runs 60 minutes, picked up a number of awards at the Summerworks Festival in Toronto, including Outstanding Play; Outstanding Performance; Outstanding Direction; and \"Best of the Fest.\" Another one-woman show features Montreal performer Cat Kidd who has crafted a show called Hyena Subpoena that plays with the relations between humans and animals. \"It's a kind of poetry slam approach to the different stories, different characters that are inspired by animals that she researched on a trip to Africa,\" said Holmes. \"She's just a beautiful performer, really incredible.\" The Gentle Art of Punishment is a multi-disciplinary piece that combines dance, music and text. Holmes said the piece was created as a collaboration by a group of young emerging female artists in Montreal, called Daughter Product. \"[The show] is truly a feminist look at our lives in the world right now, and what it means to be a woman in the world right now. The final offering of Wildside is, perhaps, one of the most surprising. \"They do the entire play of Macbeth in less than an hour, with no words,\" explained Holmes. \"It's a wonderfully inventive piece with music and performances that are just amazing.\" The play, called Macbeth Muet, is a text-less adaptation of Shakespeare's classic play. It was co-created and directed by Jon Lachlan Stewart, of La Fille du Laitier mobile theatre company. \"The story of Macbeth, in my opinion, you can boil down every scene into a physical action and that becomes very interesting and poetic.\" said Stewart. The play, which has toured through Europe and the United States, doesn't require text or speech to communicate its core message and themes. \"When we perform in France, people don't know the story. People even in Quebec people don't grow up reading Shakespeare,\" he said. \"But the piece is universal in a deep way.\" The Wildside Festival runs from Jan. 8 to 20.

At least six efforts passed at the end of November sought to draw attention to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and a separate resolution passed in December renewed condemnation of the U.S.'s unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The resolutions passed this year further voice support for long-stalled efforts to achieve a two-state solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict while separately condemning Israel's continued occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights. A U.S.-led effort to condemn Hamas, which it described as a \"terrorist organization,\" failed to gain sufficient traction within the General Assembly.

{"requested_url": "https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/egypt-mulls-constitution-change-1.61199697", "plain_text": "Cairo - Supporters of Egyptian President Abdul Fattah Al Sissi are calling for constitutional changes that would allow him to stay in power once his second term ends in 2022. Backers of the former military chief, re-elected in March with over 97 per cent of the vote, want parliament to discuss repealing an article limiting presidents to two consecutive four-year terms. In an editorial published on Sunday, the pro-government state-run daily newspaper Al Akhbar voiced hope that 2019 would see “the start of a belated political reform” to secure Al Sissi’s future in power. The column by the newspaper’s director Yasser Rizk said this would “preserve all the people’s gains in terms of security, stability and economic recovery” since Al Sissi came to power five years ago, He said the change could be approved by late summer 2019. Al Sissi, who led the army’s overthrow of Islamist president Mohammad Mursi in 2013 following mass protests against his rule, won his first term as president the following year. Al Sissi has overseen a military campaign against Daesh-linked militants in the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is slowly recovering from a deep economic crisis that has seen the value of its currency plummet and state subsidies slashed. In November 2017, even before he was re-elected, Al Sissi told American news network CNBC he would not seek a third term in office. But after his victory in the March 2018 polls, the question has gradually returned to public debate. Mohammad Fuad, and MP with the Wafd party close to the government, told AFP that “the whole of Egypt was talking about (Rizk’s) article last night”. “This issue has been under discussion everywhere in Egypt, not just in parliament, for some time,” he said, adding that a potential parliamentary debate on the issue had not been initiated by the government. In the current context of Egyptian politics, there was little surprise that the debate was taking place, Fuad said. “People have been expecting a constitutional amendment on extending presidential terms, because every time the debate turns to the end of (Al Sissi’s) second term, the question is: who is the alternative?

The GO described 2019 as a year characterised by weirdness that must be confronted with strange prayers. “2019 is a year characterised with weirdness and anyone who wants to confront a strange year must pray strange prayers. “When you pray such prayers and anyone doesn’t like it, don’t worry, continue as long as you are getting results,” he said.

Town made the worst possible start when conceding after just 61 seconds as Reece Brown capitalised on hesitant defending to set up George Williams for an easy tap-in. But the visitors responded positively and warranted their equaliser when it came four minutes into the second-half through Sam Foley’s well-placed header from Jordan Turnbull’s cross. Either side could have won it in the remaining time as Matt Crooks and Sam Hoskins almost put the Cobblers ahead but, like in the reverse fixture, a late goal decided it with Theo Archibald firing home in injury-time. But Curle, by and large, was happy with what he witnessed from his team, particularly after half-time, saying: “I thought we dominated possession in the second-half and we had the territorial advantage. “We dealt with the majority of their attacks and I thought we won the battles in midfield, but again we just needed that break. “I thought it was going to come from the cross for Sam Hoskins’ chance and that would have been a perfect day’s work.” Curle rung the changes for Town’s fourth game in 11 days, making five in all from the 2-2 draw with MK Dons on Saturday. He added: “We set up with a slightly different formation and different personnel but I thought we looked fresh and we looked bright. “Take the first two or three minutes out of it when we got caught with the goal, we settled into a rhythm, we stopped them from playing, we got close to them and we caused them problems on the break with the willingness to get into the box. “I still say we need more quality in the final third area and we can manipulate the ball and work the ball better because sometimes in the first-half we had opportunities to break, but overall it a very positive game.”", "published_date": "2019-01-01", "title": "Plenty of positives in defeat for Cobblers boss Curle", "tags": "", "categories": "Sport", "author": "James Heneghan", "sitename": "Daventry Express", "image_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/http://editorial.jpress.co.uk/mastheads/MHDE-masthead-share-img.png", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.980289876461029, "responded_url": "https://www.daventryexpress.co.uk/sport/football/plenty-of-positives-in-defeat-for-cobblers-boss-curle-1-8754736", "publisher": "daventryexpress.co.uk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101183148-00060.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-01T19:15:04+00:00"}

The Davis lawsuit stems from a June 2015 incident, when Davis hired an employee — the most qualified candidate — who had an apparent physical disability. Foundation CEO Ben Blalock apparently took issue with the hiring. Davis filed a discrimination complaint, and six months later, Davis was laid off as part of a Foundation reorganization, which followed a university-wide hiring freeze initiated by former UW President Dick McGinity amid Wyoming’s economic downturn. Davis claimed the reorganization was an illegal subterfuge for her firing. The lawsuit included UW, the Foundation and Blalock as defendants.", "published_date": "2019-01-01", "title": "UW finalizes retaliation settlement", "tags": "local_news", "categories": "", "author": "DANIEL BENDTSEN dbendtsen com", "sitename": "Laramie Boomerang", "image_url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/laramieboomerang.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/6a/76a879f4-52cb-59bc-8021-1241229a4507/5c2a974298cb4.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C547", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9844327569007874, "responded_url": "https://www.laramieboomerang.com/news/local_news/uw-finalizes-retaliation-settlement/article_b2c497ae-e614-51d4-946c-6b547e2367f0.html", "publisher": "laramieboomerang.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101143313-00059.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-01T15:26:13+00:00"}
{"requested_url": "https://www.mcall.com/opinion/national/mc-opi-what-vice-movie-gets-wrong-about-dick-cheney-20181231-story.html", "plain_text": "During a memorable scene early in Adam McKay's new film, “Vice,” a biopic about Dick Cheney, the protagonist stands outside the stark government office of Donald Rumsfeld, for whom he has just gone to work. They are at the Office of Economic Opportunity, the first in a string of jobs Rumsfeld held in the Nixon and Ford administrations in which he appointed Cheney as his top assistant. The young Cheney asks his boss what he believes in. Rumsfeld just laughs uproariously, making clear that the answer is nothing — and, as he watches Rumsfeld go back into his office, Cheney laughs heartily along with him. The message: Our antihero is all about acquiring power, by whatever means necessary. The ideas for which power might be used are, well, irrelevant. It’s a disastrous misreading of the former vice president. By disregarding his views and ideology (and several important historical moments that helped form them), “Vice” suggests that Cheney’s legacy is a soulless quest for power, rather than the advancement of fallacious beliefs that seriously damaged our nation: his unilateral approach to foreign policy, his preference for military force over diplomacy, his considerable overestimation of American strength and his desire to reshape the Middle East.  In “Vice,” Cheney’s push to increase the power of the executive branch seems to come from nowhere — and looks like just a power grab. That’s because the film omits several epochal events that formed his convictions, such as the Vietnam War. Cheney was serving as President Gerald Ford’s deputy chief of staff and then chief of staff when, in reaction to Vietnam, Congress passed a series of laws limiting the power of the executive branch in foreign policy. The film also skips the Iran-Contra affair, which prompted Cheney, as a leading Republican congressman, to set down his fullest statement of executive power. Cheney directed the Republican minority report on the scandal, which denounced “aggrandizing” intrusions by Congress into foreign policy, saying, “The boundless view of Congressional power began to take hold in the 1970s, in the wake of the Vietnam War.” Most amazingly, there’s barely a few seconds’ mention of Cheney’s role as defense secretary during the Persian Gulf War — perhaps because it might have complicated the movie’s one-dimensional portrait. In that period, after the United States flattened Iraq’s military on the way to Baghdad, the public perceptions of Cheney were largely positive.  He and then-Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell rode in a ticker-tape parade through the streets of New York, a laurel previously accorded to Charles Lindbergh, Dwight Eisenhower, Douglas MacArthur and the Apollo astronauts. In a story in The New York Times, Maureen Dowd, then a reporter, portrayed Cheney as a possible presidential candidate. Yet, while “Vice” passes over the Persian Gulf conflict, it helps explain the origins of some of Cheney’s convictions and where they went astray. The American military triumph in Iraq came just after the fall of the Berlin Wall and just before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The United States was suddenly the world’s unchallenged superpower. How should it use its new, unrivaled power? Should it seek to perpetuate the status quo, or should it try to upend the existing order in favor of new arrangements — such as, for example, a Middle East more favorable to the United States (and to Israel)? Should America give the same weight to its allies as it had during the Cold War? Cheney’s answers to these questions — a unilateral view of American power — were distilled in what was originally called the Defense Planning Guidance of 1992 (issued under Cheney’s own name as he was leaving office). That document argues, contrary to the movie’s suggestion, that Cheney was far more interested in increasing America’s power in the world and in preventing any challenges to it than in simply augmenting his own bureaucratic influence.  “Vice” is so invested in turning Cheney into the source of everything bad from the George W. Bush administration that it ascribes to him even more than the considerable clout he really had. McKay’s Cheney seems to be the force behind Bush’s tax cuts, even though the president had promised them in his campaign long before Cheney joined the ticket. (The vice president cast the deciding vote in the Senate but wasn’t the lead architect.) The film version of Cheney also comes up with the idea to have Powell, then secretary of state, make the case for the Iraq war at the United Nations; this was actually Bush’s idea. Since the movie doesn’t deal with Cheney’s views, it doesn’t show what happened on those occasions when they collided with reality. It doesn’t show the way he minimized the obstacles to the use of force or to other assertions of American power. When interviewer Tim Russert asked him on “Meet the Press” on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq if he thought Americans were prepared for a “long, costly and bloody” war, Cheney replied, “Well, I don’t think it’s likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe that we will be greeted as liberators.” He said more than once that the Iraqi insurgency that followed the American invasion was in its “last throes,” when it wasn’t. Stripping Cheney of ideology makes him look vaguely like a forerunner of President Trump. It suggests that the same forces — ignorant voters, sinister manipulators — were at work. “Vice” includes fleeting shots of Mike Pence and Jeff Sessions, who were at best marginal to Cheney’s career. It may well be that, in the entertainment industry, all conservatives seem alike. But Cheney was an uber-hawk, while Trump is a pseudo-populist, and they are not the same. Trump has spent the past couple of weeks pulling American troops from Syria, a decision that runs directly contrary to Cheney’s core beliefs: As vice president, he consistently avowed a strong U.S. military presence in the Middle East. Later, he lambasted President Barack Obama for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq. And Trump wants desperately to curtail the flow of people into our country. Immigration wasn’t a major issue for Cheney, but to the extent he talked about it, he was largely supportive. Along with Bush, Cheney pushed unsuccessfully for legislation that would have opened a way to legal status for more than 10 million immigrants. Three years ago, Cheney upbraided Trump for trying to bar Muslims from the United States. “This whole notion that somehow we can just say no more Muslims, just ban a whole religion, goes against everything we stand for,” Cheney told interviewer Hugh Hewitt. Cheney was also a free trader, where Trump is decidedly not. In the end, the Cheney of “Vice” comes across as a cartoon Darth Vader, and a peculiar one at that. Past depictions of Cheney-as-Vader usually showed him leading the way toward American domination of the Middle East — or of the whole world. The new Cheney-Vader of “Vice” cares about nothing but his own dominion. He has no beliefs. In this way “Vice” misses the most important aspect of the real-life Dick Cheney: He was wrong.

Paul LePage pardoned a former Republican state lawmaker for a 35-year-old felony-level drug trafficking conviction, a move that could affect an ongoing investigation into whether that same lawmaker illegally hunted with firearms.  Former state Rep. Jeffrey Pierce of Dresden said he requested clemency for the conviction and that he was notified by LePage’s office that the Governor had signed the pardon late last week.  Pierce did not agree to a recorded interview, but he reiterated previous comments in which he described the conviction as ancient history and the Maine Democratic Party’s move to publicize his past during his unsuccessful reelection bid as ‘dirty politics.’  Pierce also acknowledged that he had hunted with firearms since his conviction, but said he did not realize that he was violating state and federal laws, which prohibit anyone convicted of a felony-level crime from possessing firearms.  The firearms violation is the subject of an investigation by the Maine Warden Service, a probe that is still open, according to Maine Warden Service spokesman John MacDonald.  Under state law, a pardon does not expunge a criminal record, but makes it confidential in most instances.  The governor’s office did not respond to emails or a phone message seeking comment.  Pierce was among a core group of House Republicans who were loyal to LePage during his two terms as governor.  LePage’s final day in office is Wednesday. He will be succeeded by Democratic Gov.-elect Janet Mills.  Pierce was convicted of felony-level drug trafficking in 1983 after selling cocaine and marijuana to an undercover police officer. He has other misdemeanor offenses for the years between 1980 and 2006.  State and federal laws bar convicted felons from possessing firearms. It is also unlawful for a felon to obtain a firearms hunting permit and applications expressly ask people apply for licenses to state whether they have been convicted of a crime.  LePage has taken a tough approach and drug traffickers in particular. He supported tougher sentences for drug traffickers and pushed for more law enforcement resources to combat the Maine opioid crisis.  His position has caused controversy, first for joking during a radio interview that convicted traffickers should be executed by the guillotine, and later for falsely suggesting that the majority of people arrested for drug trafficking are black or Hispanic.  Pierce says he has long since moved on from his checkered past. He told Maine Public Radio that he was upset when Democrats publicized his criminal record during the campaign.  Pierce lost his reelection bid to Allison Hepler. He said he plans to release a full statement about his pardon sometime on New Year’s Day.

Together we'll continue bringing the change that will set us on a path for enduring success.  Four years ago, I stood here before you and we faced a very different Rhode Island than we do today. The foundation of our economy had eroded. Our unemployment rate was among the highest in the nation. Our roads, bridges and schools were crumbling, and we didn't even have a plan to fix them. We felt vulnerable as we saw the people we love lose their jobs and homes and struggle to make ends meet.  It was like my dad always used to say, our leaders didn't act and Rhode Islanders got left behind. In my first few months as Governor, I can't tell you how many times somebody asked me: \"Do you really think we can turn this economy around?\"  I asked all of you then to join me in committing yourselves to Rhode Island, and to think about what you could do to support our state's comeback. And so, today, I begin with a thank you. Thanks to so many of you-from every corner of our state. We rolled up our sleeves and faced our challenges.  Together, we believed that we could ignite an economic comeback. Together, we believed it was possible to change the way we did things. Together, we believed that with dedication and perseverance Rhode Island could once again stand tall, stand proud, and stand strong.  Over four short years, we have made the choices that spurred our economy to grow by leaps and bounds. We've changed the way we do economic development, infrastructure investing, and job training. As a result, we've been able to put tens of thousands of people back to work and ensure that they can provide for their families and take pride in the work they do. We've created job training opportunities for the young adult at the start of her career and the middle-aged dad looking for a way out of his low-paying job. We've launched a once-in-a-generation investment to make sure that all children will go to schools that are warm, safe, and dry-schools that any parent would be proud to send their kids to. And we've made a promise to all of our young adults that they can attend community college tuition-free.  There is no question we have stopped our decline and this new approach is working.  Now, let's commit ourselves to sustaining the comeback until every Rhode Islander is included, and to making choices that will position our state for success for the long haul.  Our work is not done until we lift up those who are struggling the most. Our work is not done until we end the opioid crisis and ensure that those in recovery are included in our economic comeback. Our work's not done until we make sure every Rhode Islander willing to work hard can get a good job. Our work's not done until women and men have the same economic opportunities and can thrive in workplaces free from harassment.  And, let's take a moment to recognize the record numbers of women who have run for office and are taking on positions of leadership in all walks of life here in Rhode Island and around the country. We're all counting on you to stay at the table long enough to make real change.  For four years we've fought hard to make Rhode Island a place where people have confidence that they can make a good life for themselves and their families. As we continue our journey to ensure that our economic comeback touches every Rhode Islander, let's be mindful and realistic about the challenges that lie before us.  Our country is more divided than ever. This is true partly because economic inequality is greater than at any other time in the last century. Too many people face a reality that no matter how hard they work, they just can't get ahead. Many seek to divide us further with hateful words and actions often borne out of fear and resentment. Too often, we don't even take time to talk to each other and understand points of view that are different from our own.  This division has left many of us scared for the future of our country, for the world our kids will grow up in, for the \"us-versus-them\" mentality that sadly thrives in today's political climate.  With the stakes so high, it's time for us to adhere to Rhode Island's founding principles of inclusion, equality and tolerance. We believe that all people deserve to be treated with respect and dignity no matter your race, religion, gender, ethnicity, who you love or where you come from. Let's find the courage to bring to the table perspectives that have been missing. Often the best and brightest minds have been overlooked or ignored. We need their voices at the highest levels-in the judiciary, in board rooms, in government and in public safety. Their contributions will make our decisions better.  Our other great challenge is to accelerate our economic progress at a time of unprecedented, rapid changes in our global economy. And, to do it in a way that includes everyone. Expanding opportunity for all can only make our economy more resilient in the years to come.  To every Rhode Islander out there who is still struggling and doesn't feel included in our recovery, I want you to know that we won't stop until we've reached you.  We won't stop until our students are set up to achieve their dreams from pre-K through high school and beyond. A high school diploma can no longer be the endpoint of our education system. Kindergarten can no longer be the starting point. We have to prioritize investing in our children during their formative years. From Pre-K to high school and whatever comes next, it's our obligation to set them up on a path for success.  We won't stop until every Rhode Islander has a shot at a good paying job. Our world is changing so quickly. This change requires all of us to be lifelong learners. No matter who you are, where you come from or what point you're at in your career, you deserve access to job training, an apprenticeship, and education that will help you get ahead in whatever field you choose.  We won't stop until higher education is affordable and accessible to all Rhode Islanders. If you are willing to work hard, a college education should be within reach: It should be within reach for a teenager from Central Falls, a single mom from Warwick who wants to return to school, and anyone else in our state. Working together, we've already set our state on a strong path. But now it's time to make the dream a reality for every Rhode Islander. I cannot think of any priority more urgent to ensuring our economic resiliency in the years ahead.  We won't stop until we double down on lasting commitments to protect our environment. Let's be proud that we are the Ocean State. Let's remain committed to securing renewable energy and protecting our green spaces to ensure our state's natural beauty can be enjoyed for generations to come.  We won't stop until every Rhode Islander has the peace of mind to know that their healthcare will be there when they need it most. No one should ever have to choose between paying for health care and paying the rent. Health care is under attack all across this country. But here in Rhode Island we know the Affordable Care Act is saving lives, and we know it's the reason thousands of Rhode Islanders finally have the peace of mind they deserve. Today, let's resolve in the face of these attacks to protect health care in Rhode Island.  And we won't stop until we have common sense gun laws. It is not enough to send our thoughts and prayers each time another act of gun violence takes away a life full of promise. Since I've been Governor, I have lowered the flags at the State House 13 times in four years for 223 lives lost in mass shootings. It is time to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Our children's future and their lives depend on it.  No matter the rhetoric in Washington, or the divisiveness we see on TV, no matter the attempts to use fear to breed anger, Rhode Islanders of all races, faiths, and backgrounds can unite and rise above our differences so that our progress will endure.  After all, this is Rhode Island. Let's let our size be our strength.  Here, we're connected to our neighbors. We really do know our children's teachers and coaches. Our lives are linked from generation to generation. We know how to come together to make Rhode Island a state we're proud to call home.  And here we're delivering results that keep the American Dream alive and well. We're making the promise of economic opportunity a reality through our actions. We may disagree. But in the end, we get things done.  The cure to divisiveness is action. So, let's show everyone what Rhode Island can do. Above all, we anchor ourselves to hope. Hope makes us resilient. Hope cannot be easily taken away. And hope guides us toward lasting progress.  As I stand here looking out on our Capital City I'm filled with optimism because I've seen what we can accomplish together in just four short years, and I know that even more is possible. I look out at you today, and I see so many Rhode Islanders who are eager to keep pushing our state forward, who are excited for our progress but know we have so much more to do.  So, let's commit to showing our family, our friends, our neighbors, and our children that when we work together we are at our very best.  Ask yourself now: How will you root for Rhode Island? How will you help build a bright and enduring future for our children? How will you help put aside the things that separate us and make our state better?  When we recognize that our futures are connected... When we commit to leaving no one behind... When we deliver on the promise of economic opportunity for all, that's success. Together, we will overcome fear and make Rhode Island a beacon of hope for America.  Thank you. God Bless You, and God Bless Rhode Island.", "published_date": "2019-01-01", "title": "Full text of Governor Raimondo's speech", "tags": "", "categories": "News", "author": null, "sitename": "providencejournal.com", "image_url": "https://www.providencejournal.com/Global/images/head/nameplate/fb/providence-journal_logo-j_icon.png", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9704139232635498, "responded_url": "https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190101/full-text-of-governor-raimondos-speech", "publisher": "providencejournal.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101183148-00060.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-01T19:41:28+00:00"}

The large U.S. railroad operators are overhauling operating plans to streamline the movement of locomotives and railcars across their networks, emulating the turnaround plan implemented during the past two years at CSX Corp., which operates a rail network in the Eastern U.S. To encourage customers to go along, railroads are imposing fees when customers take too long to unload railcars, don't have their facilities ready to pick up shipments and take other actions that could cause slowdowns on the rail network. The Surface Transportation Board, which oversees freight rail service and rates in the U.S., is examining the practice. Chairwoman Ann Begeman said that while the body understands the need to improve service, it questions the fairness of a system in which shippers can get hit with fees but railroads aren't penalized when their service is subpar. \"I just want to make sure they're commercially fair to the shippers they're serving,\" Ms. Begeman said at a recent industry conference. The railroads say they do offer credits to shippers when they are late to pick up railcars. But the STB plans to track the fees more closely. Ms. Begeman has requested that all of the large railroad operators provide quarterly reports on how much they've tallied from the fees. The STB has followed the spread of so-called precision scheduled railroading since Chief Executive Hunter Harrison began implementing the strategy at CSX before he died in 2017. The abrupt changes to the Jacksonville, Fla.-based railroad operator -- including layoffs, closed facilities and idled equipment -- initially caused gridlock across the network that delayed deliveries and disrupted the operations of some factories. The STB fielded complaints from shippers about service, held regular meetings with railroad executives and convened a hearing in October 2017 about the problems and CSX's response. CSX's service has improved over the past year, as it has moved more product at faster speeds with fewer assets. However, other railways, notably Union Pacific, have struggled with additional volumes and crew shortages that have caused service issues and congestion on parts of their networks. Now they are following CSX with their own plans to improve service. Union Pacific, based in Omaha, Neb., in October began a new operating plan based on precision scheduled railroading. Norfolk Southern, which competes with CSX in the Eastern U.S., in February plans to detail operational changes as well. But as those changes take place, shippers have questioned the fees, which some view as a way to make money rather than improve service. Paul Verst, chief executive of Verst Logistics Inc., a provider of warehousing and transportation based in Walton, Ky., reached out to the STB after Norfolk Southern, which provides rail service to his warehouses, proposed cutting the amount of time to unload cars from 48 to 24 hours before a $150-a-day fee would kick in. Previously, the fee was $100. He saw the new fee structure, which went into effect Jan. 1, as purely a way to generate revenue. Sometimes he may need more time to unload cars because the railroad will drop off more cars than expected, he said. \"What they're asking us now is not fair and reasonable,\" Mr. Verst said. In a letter to the STB, Norfolk Southern CEO James Squires said the new fee structure is intended to encourage quicker unloading of railcars so they can be put back in use and keep the railroad running smoothly. He said Norfolk Southern will increase the credits it will provide customers if the railroad experiences problems. \"We are demonstrating to them our increased confidence in our service product, which should in turn cause them to further improve asset utilization, creating a virtuous cycle,\" Mr. Squires wrote. Other rail shippers say the higher fees are an undue burden, given the problems they have endured, and they are encouraged by the STB taking a closer look. Shippers \"have not yet really seen the benefits to these operational changes but they certainly have suffered the service problems and are seeing new costs being added on,\" said Jeff Sloan, senior director of regulatory and technical affairs for the American Chemistry Council, a trade group. \"It seems awfully one-sided.\" Write to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com", "published_date": "2019-01-01", "title": "Regulator Examines Railroads for Hitting Customers With Late Fees | MarketScreener", "tags": "Norfolk Southern Corporation stock exchange, news, information, press release, by, paul, ziobro, federal, regulators, are, scrutinizing, fees, imposed, by, norfolk, southern, corp,, union, pacific, corp, and, other, railroads, that, are, meant, to, get, their, customers, on, board, with, new | NSC | US6558441084", "categories": "", "author": null, "sitename": "SURPERFORMANCE", "image_url": null, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9777266979217529, "responded_url": "https://www.marketscreener.com/NORFOLK-SOUTHERN-CORPORAT-13802/news/Regulator-Examines-Railroads-for-Hitting-Customers-With-Late-Fees-27811905/?utm_medium=RSS&utm_content=20190101", "publisher": "marketscreener.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101143313-00059.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-01T15:48:04+00:00"}

It is the first of January, which means it is the first day of a brand new year and at the same time, it also the first day of the winter transfer window. Barcelona, just like the other teams, will have their task cut out as they will look to bring in some reinforcements to the Camp Nou with the second half of the season set to get underway in a few days' time. Barcelona are leading LaLiga at the start of 2019, with a three-point gap over Atletico Madrid who are in the second place and an eight-point lead (played an extra game) over their arch-rivals Real Madrid, whoa re fourth in the table. In the first Barcelona transfer roundup of 2019, we take a look at what the Catalan giants are up to in the first day of the transfer window. Frenkie de Jong agrees to join Barcelona According to reports in SportBild, one of the hottest young talents in Football, Frenkie de Jong has agreed to a five-year contract with defending LaLiga champions and the league table-toppers Barcelona. De Jong has been linked with many top European clubs and this could end all the speculations of him being targetted by giants like Bayern Munich.

Macerich, the owner of Scottsdale Fashion Square, announced the mall will be home to Wonderspaces’ first permanent, 16,000-square-foot location opening in early 2019. “The first permanent location for Wonderspaces, with its dynamic roster of curated art installations, is a strong fit for Scottsdale Fashion Square and for Macerich,” said Doug Healey, executive vice president of leasing at Macerich. Wonderspaces debuted in San Diego in 2017 as a pop-up art show, drawing more than 60,000 people in 2017 and over 112,000 people in 2018 over a span of 78 days. In Scottsdale Fashion Square, Wonderspaces plans to present three ticketed shows per year. Jason Shin, co-founder of Wonderspaces, said it chose Scottsdale Fashion Square for its first permanent location because it offers a unique opportunity to make the artwork of their paid partner artists accessible to metro Phoenix. “When looking at different locations, we were looking for spaces that will help make the shows, the artwork accessible to a broad audience,” Shin said, adding that Wonderspaces is for all people, including those who may not identify with art. Shin said they’ve been eyeing the Phoenix area for two years. “The first time we approached the Macerich team was about the space that is now the Apple store, to run the show on a temporary basis,” he said, adding that Wonderspaces is also planning to open permanent spaces in Austin, Philadelphia and Miami. Wonderspaces’ goal is to create a convenient, accessible space where people of all ages can connect with art and with each other. “We were really excited to see that in San Diego that multiple generations, three generations of a family could feel like they could come and connect and have a place that was for them,” Shin said. “And that’s what we’re excited to do in Scottsdale.” At the first show in Scottsdale Fashion Square, Wonderspaces will pull large-scale installations and interactive artworks by artists from around the world from past pop-up shows in San Diego. Past Wonderspaces installations include “Sweet Spot,” comprising 3,700 multicolored nylon chords suspected from a ceiling; “Pulse Portal,” an 18-by-18 foot sculpture made of Plexiglass panels; and “Dinner Party,” a short virtual reality thriller where attendees are seated at a table to witness the first nationally known UFO abduction case in America. “The high-caliber artists and the exceptional setting Wonderspaces is creating to showcase their exciting work will come together as a powerful draw for this sophisticated region and for visitors from around the world,” Healey said. While ticket prices for the Scottsdale shows have not yet been determined at this time, Shin said they are working to bring the ticket prices down. Ticket prices at the pop-up shows in San Diego ranged from $16 to $24. “We’re still working through the planning of it to understand what makes sense here and understanding all of the costs that are going into the construction process and the building of the team,” Shin said. A portion of ticket and merchandise sales will, however, support local causes. “That’s something we’ll always do,” Shin said. “We would very much like to join the arts community here and support the arts community here.” That also includes working with artists local to Scottsdale and Valley-wide. “We very much welcome meeting artists and to work with them to present their work to the audience and to audiences across the country,” Shin said. In addition to seeking local artists, Shin is looking to fill two large roles within the Scottsdale Wonderspaces team. Currently, they’re in need of a general manager and a marketing manager. “[Wonderspaces] is going to succeed or fail based off the quality of the team, and we’re looking for folks to join and lead the efforts in Arizona,” Shin said. Those interested in applying, should visit wonderspaces.com/job-inquiries.

It was an afternoon which wasn’t without its challenges as, amid speculation about manager Aitor Karanka’s position in the build-up, his team had to cope with the loss of defender Michael Hefele early on and also fight their way back from 2-1 down.  You can watch Reds reporter Paul Taylor’s verdict on the Championship clash in our latest Forest video.  Jack Colback had put the hosts ahead in only the sixth minute, and they retained that lead going into the break, though they had also come under pressure from their opponents.  Leeds saw their numbers reduced just before the interval when Kalvin Phillips was sent off for a challenge on Adlene Guedioura.  But the division’s trailblazers showed no sign of letting it affect them as they equalised through Jack Clarke shortly after the restart, then took the lead courtesy of Ezgjan Alioski 10 minutes later.  Forest, though, showed great character and drew level with little more than 20 minutes remaining as Colback bagged his second of the afternoon.  Daryl Murphy went on to crown an excellent individual performance with his first goal since September to make it 3-2.  And substitute Ben Osborn capped a pleasing day all round when he netted a superb effort with 77 minutes gone.  It ended a five-match winless streak for Karanka’s men and lifted them back up to seventh in the table, four points adrift of the play-off spots.

The school district announced renovations to Pocatello High School in Old Town earlier this year.  The district wants to connect the high school’s main two buildings with a two story addition that will include an elevator, additional classrooms and offices and a common area.  But as of Monday morning, 1,543 people have signed a petition on change.org called “Save Pocatello High School”.  The petition says the plan is “not in keeping with or complimentary to the tradition and historical nature of the building, destroys the architectural beauty, and will permanently scar the exterior.”  The petition also says there wasn’t enough time for public comment.  “Ultimately it would just kind of be a continuation of what I see as the degradation of Pocatello High School,” says Steven McCurdy, who created the petition, “First they boarded up the windows in the 70s’, then they added on a doorway to the old gymnasium that was out of character and just ugly and is still an eyesore, all of which has taken away and destroyed the actual beauty of the building.”  Hummel Architects is the firm designing the addition.

An unidentied 25-year-old man was been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, Greater Manchester Police said during a media briefing Tuesday. The attack occurred just before 9 p.m. at the Manchester Victoria railway station \"Last night we experienced a horrific attack on people out to simply enjoy the New Year's Eve celebrations in Manchester,\" Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said. \"My thoughts are with the couple who are still being treated in hospital for their serious injuries and with the brave British Transport Police officer who was also stabbed during the attack.\"  A police sergeant in his 30s was stabbed in the shoulder and released from hospital Tuesday.  Two other two victims were in their 50s -- a woman with injuries to her face and stomach and a man with injuries to his stomach. They are not considered life threatening.  The suspect lived in the Cheetham Hill area of the city and officers were carrying out a search at his address, Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, told reporters. They don't know if he is a British national.  \"There is wide reporting in the press about what the attacker allegedly said during the incident and because of this we want to be clear, we are treating this as a terrorism investigation,\" he said.  But he added they are \"retaining an open mind in relation to the motivation for this attack,\" and there is no proof \"to suggest at this time others are involved.\"  Two knives were recovered at the scene.  The train station returned to to a \"normal pattern,\" according to Metrolink in a Twitter post but advised to expect delays.  BBC 5 live producer Sam Clack was an eye witness to the stabbings.  \"Just been very close to the most terrifying thing,\" Clack tweeted. \"Man stabbed in Manchester Victoria station on tram platform. Feet from me, I was close to jumping on the tracks as attacker had long kitchen knife. Totally shaken. This is seriously messed up.\"  The suspect shouted \"Allah,\" which is God in English, during the attack, along with a slogan criticizing Western governments, he said.  \"It looked like they were having a fight, but the woman was screaming in this blood-curdling way,\" Clack said to the BBC. \"I saw police in high-vis come towards him. He came towards me.  \"I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good, 12-inch blade. It was just fear, pure fear.\"  He said police, who responded quickly, used pepper spray and a Taser to get the man to the ground, \"He was very much resisting arrest,\" Clack said.  Counter terrorism police were leading the investigation.  Fireworks at Albert Square went on as planned despite the incident, according to the Manchester City Council.  \"My thoughts are with those who were injured in the suspected terrorist attack in Manchester last night,\" Prime Minister Theresa May posred on Twitter. \"I thank the emergency services for their courageous response.

Then, his legendary sense of humour kicked in. “Now, I get to eat as much bacon as I want. Cholesterol isn’t even a concern,” he wrote to Bevin. She recalled the exchange following Norton’s death the evening of Dec. 28 at a hospice in Ottawa at the age of 51. “Michael had the most amazing sense of humour of anyone I have ever met in my life,” Bevin said. “Even in his most excruciating moments in life, when his heart was breaking, he would try to find the humour in it and come up with something really wacky and fitting.” Norton was well-known in town as someone who would jump in to assist anyone who needed a helping hand. A self-employed jack of all trades, he did painting and gardening for seniors, found appliances for single moms, donated a portion of proceeds of refundable bottles to Armitage Village Public School’s breakfast program, helped out at the 310 Cope centre and much more, Bevin said. “We indeed lost one of our finest,” she said. One of Norton’s final wishes was that his charity work be continued by the community, with people already having come forward to carry on his efforts when he fell ill. Bevin, co-owner of Your Newfie Sisters home staging and downsizing services, often hired Norton to help take items to the Salvation Army or to fix a senior’s fence or paint a wall before their house went up for sale. A friend to many, Norton was known for his hilarious posts on Facebook. As news of Norton’s death began to spread on Saturday, there was a great outpouring of grief for the man that Bevin described as Newmarket’s “ambassador of friendship, goodwill and humour.” “You were a man of great honour and integrity. Your sense of humour was inspiring and brought sunshine to all who knew you,” Cindy Davey wrote on the Newmarket; What’s Happening Facebook page. “Your fight to survive the horrible disease that plagued you was so brave. You will be loved and missed by me and anyone who had the absolute pleasure of knowing you. Heaven has gained an angel.” Norton had an impact on everyone he met, Heather Studdy said. “You were a light in everyone’s life that met you. It will be a long time before everyone meets up with the kindness and caring you shared each and every day,” she wrote. Norton leaves behind his mother, Dawn, father, Frank, sisters Wendy and Julie, brother, Jay, and his Boston terrier, Chase. Roadhouse and Rose funeral home has offered to hold a celebration of Norton’s life, Details have not yet been finalized. Lisa Queen is a reporter for YorkRegion.com and its sister papers.

A Suffolk County grand jury handed up indictments Dec. 20 charging Edmund Marcheterre, 48, with six counts of unemployment fraud and three counts of larceny of more than $250, according to a news release from Attorney General Maura Healey. It is alleged that Marcheterre underreported wages during 96 weeks of three unemployment claim periods from December 2014 to July 2017 and that he fraudulently collected more than $27,000 in unemployment benefits from the state Department of Unemployment Assistance during this period. Marcheterre is scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 9 in Suffolk Superior Court, according to the Attorney General's Office. Also indicted were: Jose Pacheco, 42, of Fall River, charged with six counts of unemployment fraud and three counts of larceny of more than $250.

Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it’s not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, ‘Don’t tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.’ Huayi Tencent Entertainment is a smaller company with a market capitalization of HK$2.6b, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors. In the chart below below, we can see that institutions own shares in the company. Let’s delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about 419. What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Huayi Tencent Entertainment? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Huayi Tencent Entertainment already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 7.1% of the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Huayi Tencent Entertainment, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. We note that hedge funds don’t have a meaningful investment in Huayi Tencent Entertainment. Our information suggests that there isn’t any analyst coverage of the stock, so it is probably little known. Insider Ownership Of Huayi Tencent Entertainment While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Huayi Tencent Entertainment Company Limited. It has a market capitalization of just HK$2.6b, and insiders have HK$402m worth of shares in their own names. This may suggest that the founders still own a lot of shares. You can click here to see if they have been buying or selling. General Public Ownership The general public, with a 43% stake in the company, will not easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Public Company Ownership Public companies currently own 34% of 419 stock. It’s hard to say for sure, but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it’s worth watching this space for changes in ownership. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

More teams that failed to make the playoffs in 2017 are in this season than there are repeaters. Yep, seven of the 12 qualifiers didn't make it last year, some not coming close. The Chiefs, Saints, Rams, Patriots and defending champion Eagles are back. Houston, which started out 0-3, and Chicago went from worst to first. Amazing? Not quite: In 15 of the past 16 seasons, that's occurred. Baltimore hadn't gotten to the postseason the last three seasons, but squeezed in by winning the AFC North — at the expense of perennial qualifier Pittsburgh, which did an uncharacteristic flop by dropping five of its final six games. Indianapolis hadn't advanced since 2014, either, and took care of that with a 33-17 victory at Tennessee. Seattle, which made a habit of going deep in the playoffs and winning the 2013 championship, got back in as an NFC wild card after a one-year absence. The Chargers already had clinched a spot and will be the fifth seed in the AFC. They return for the first time in five years. And Dallas (10-6) grabbed the NFC East crown. Like Seattle (10-6), the Cowboys were last in the playoffs in 2016. And they meet up on Saturday night in Big D. \"I think what it comes down to is nobody wanted to play in Chicago. We wanted to play in Dallas in a dome,\" said always-frank Seattle receiver Doug Baldwin. The other game Saturday is the AFC South matchup of Indianapolis (10-6) at Houston (11-5). \"The most satisfying thing is to walk in the locker room, look at your teammate and say, 'We did it,' and we did it,\" Colts coach Frank Reich said. \"Those are three of the best words that you can ever say to your teammate. To me, that's really the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\" Reich knows about that pot of gold. He helped collect it as offensive coordinator with the Eagles last season. Those Eagles (9-7 ) finished off a superb late-season run behind — you guessed it — Nick Foles. The backup quarterback turned Super Bowl hero of last season again replaced an injured Carson Wentz and worked some magic. So did Philly's defense in a 24-0 romp at Washington that kept the Eagles in contention. When the visiting Bears (12-4) played their regulars — way to go, coach Matt Nagy — with nothing to gain and knocked off NFC North rival Minnesota (8-7-1), the Eagles earned a trip to ... Where else: Chicago, next Sunday to close out the wild-card round. \"This is what we expected,\" Eagles star safety Malcolm Jenkins said. \"We are where we are expected to be. The journey hasn't been how we drew it up, per se, but this is where we expected to be. I don't think anyone is surprised by the results. \"We have really just put our heads down and went to work this past month. Now, we are in the postseason. Throw out the regular season and everything that's happened before then.\" The Chargers, who had the second-best AFC record yet wound up a wild card because Kansas City held the tiebreaker to win the West, would like to throw out their last meeting with Baltimore. In prime time last week, they lost at home to Baltimore when a win would have put them atop their division. Oh well, now it's off to the Inner Harbor on Sunday and another chance to sink the Ravens. \"It's a heck of a challenge,\" Chargers veteran quarterback Philip Rivers said. \"I don't think there was really a team that wasn't going to be a heck of a challenge. To get to this point, there are only 12 teams in. Again, this first weekend where eight teams are playing and they're all good. \"That's a team that outplayed last week. It'll be a new game, new everything and we'll see who can play the best this time through.\" Sitting by will be the Chiefs and Patriots in the AFC, Saints and Rams in the NFC. They know, as do all four wild-card hosts, that there's no overwhelming favorite in these playoffs. \"We're going to sit back and just watch these games upcoming,\" Rams cornerback Marcus Peters said, \"and we're going to prepare for ourselves to be ready to go.

Hawaii's avocado industry opened in earnest in early December with weekly shipments of about 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms) of avocados to two Seattle-based wholesale produce companies, West Hawaii Today reported this week. Continue Reading Below Shipments of that size, which nearly reach the capacity of the state's only avocado packing facility, are expected to continue through March. \"The potential is unreal,\" said Billy Wakefield, a board member of the Hawaii Avocado Association. \"Ultimately, hundreds of acres could be sent to the mainland very easily.\" The trees on each acre could potentially produce about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms) of avocados each year, Wakefield said. Hawaii avocados were first shipped to Alaska in 1987, and the fruit started get sent to the mainland U.S. without restrictions by 1989, said Mike Scharf, officer in charge for U.S. Department of Agriculture in west Hawaii. The shipments stopped in 1992 over concerns about fruit flies spreading from Hawaii to the continental U.S. Advertisement A final rule was published in the Federal Register allowing the import of Sharwil avocados to 32 states and the District of Columbia in 2013 after years of research to develop a system reducing the risk of fruit flies. USDA inspectors vet all Hawaii farms before certification, monitor their processes to ensure compliance and also check fruit at packing facilities before it's exported. \"They can't get enough fruit in the air to these markets,\" Scharf said. \"It's just going to take a while for it to gear up again.\" Scharf said 12 Hawaii farms have either been certified or are preparing for a USDA visit. ___ Information from: West Hawaii Today, http://www.westhawaiitoday.com", "published_date": "2019-01-01", "title": "Hawaii avocado industry expects growth as exports begin", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Associated Press", "sitename": "Fox Business", "image_url": null, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9654238820075989, "responded_url": "https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/hawaii-avocado-industry-expects-growth-as-exports-begin?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxbusiness%2Flatest+%28Internal+-+Latest+News+-+Text%29", "publisher": "foxbusiness.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101230054-00061.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-01T23:53:41+00:00"}

The second-prize ticket bought at Wrightstown Wine & Liquor on East Main Street was one of six sold nationally that matched five numbers drawn, but not the Mega Ball. The others were sold in California, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Washington. The Washington ticket is worth $2 million because the purchaser paid extra for the Megaplier option.

The city has brought on its first-ever chief innovation officer to prove it. Mayor John Tecklenburg hired Tracy McKee for the new job in late November to modernize and streamline city government processes, particularly through data gathering and technology. McKee was the city's director of geographic information systems for 18 years until January 2017, when she left for a job as the city of Baltimore's chief data officer. She returned to Charleston for the senior-level position that doubles as a special adviser to the mayor. She'll replace former special adviser Josh Martin, who left earlier this year. \"I decided it was a great opportunity for me to come back home,\" she said. McKee brings unique insight gleaned from her experience in Baltimore. That city pioneered the concept of tracking the performance of government agencies through data gathering — such as average time spent responding to citizens' service calls — as a way to spot inefficiencies or oversights. The program, CitiStat, was so successful in improving everything from water quality to the city's murder rates that many other communities around the United States developed their own versions of the performance improvement system. She worked closely with the CitiStat group and wants to help Charleston replicate some of its tactics. It's good timing, too. Novak Consulting Group has recently completed some of its performance assessments of city departments, and McKee will be tasked with carrying out its recommendations. Her experience with CitiStat will likely help her do that, she said. \"We determine, 'What does success look like in this case?' Then, we work backwards, like, 'Okay if this is what success looks like, what are the proxies we can use to track our progress?'\" she said. \"We develop the metrics, then meet regularly to talk about how departments are doing.\" McKee will also help develop a flooding alert system to notify residents when and where flooding is expected.

Pentagon officials believe the high-tech cannon could pave the way for a military advantage defending assets on sea and on land. Photo: U.S. Department of Defense The world was shocked when pictures began circulating early last year of a strange, large gun seemingly bolted to the bows of a Chinese amphibious assault ship. It turned out to be the world’s first naval rail gun. Now it’s been pictured in operation. A hazy image of the oddly-shaped ship with its oversized gun sailing in the open ocean has been released on China’s tightly controlled social media networks.  Long time no see, the railgun test ship is spotted undergoing sea trials these days. pic.twitter.com/WdxXkyYWrF — dafeng cao (@dafengcao) December 29, 2018 It shows the vessel undergoing testing on the open ocean. If true, it means Beijing has beaten the United States — and the world — to getting the next generation weapon into operational testing. CHALLENGING CAPABILITY The Type 072II Yuting-class tank landing ship Haiyangshan has been converted from its previous role to become an experimental testbed. This is likely because its open cargo bay is capable of holding the extensive array of batteries and generators necessary to power the next-generation weapon. While still no warship, the cannon it carries is a fearsome sign of things to come. It does away with the heat, pressure and residue of gunpowder-powered cannons. Instead, it uses intense bursts of energy to build a focused magnetic field capable of flinging out cannon shells at many times the speed of sound. This gives the gun much greater speed, range — and accuracy — than conventional cannons. And it can be armed with guided shells capable of homing in on targets, and dodging defensive systems. DELVE DEEPER: How hypersonic weapons will change the face of war But it comes at a cost. Instead of stacks of highly volatile propellant buried deep in the ship’s magazines, the gun needs massive amounts of on-demand electricity. This requires the generators to produce it, the batteries to hold it, and the capacitors to control it.  Don't need to worry about the power supply, note the three containers on deck, which could be the power station. pic.twitter.com/gTk4AgdvXT — dafeng cao (@dafengcao) January 31, 2018 Which is why the old 119m long amphibious assault ship, once capable of carrying 10 tanks, is being used as a testbed. The United States Navy has done a similar thing. It has fitted a demonstration version of its Laser Weapon System (LaWS) aboard USS Ponce, a former amphibious transport dock ship now converted into a floating base and testbed. While it has been at sea since 2014, the US Navy has so far not been successful in meeting its energy and fittings requirements aboard existing frontline warships. NEW TECHNOLOGY Weapons travelling at hypersonic speeds are the objective of a new arms race. Beijing has also been proclaiming the success of its own hypersonic missile program, stating it gives them the power to drive the United States out of the South China Sea by sinking its aircraft carriers. The electromagnetic rail gun is another incarnation of the advantages of extreme speed. “Railguns use electromagnetic energy to attack targets and are considered an advanced technology that offers greater range and more lethality, while the cost is even cheaper than traditional guns,” the China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation announced in 2015.  The railgun's 3D model made by 模人一架. pic.twitter.com/pNVG2PPwBr — dafeng cao (@dafengcao) 3 February 2018 It achieves this by generating an electromagnetic field between two rails (thus the term rail-gun). A conductive sling, called an armature, catapults a warhead between the rails. Such is the stress of acceleration, speed and friction that even the warheads have to be of completely new design and materials. While they can be ‘dumb’ like traditional unguided cannon shells, they can also be fitted with advanced avionics and sensors to guide them to their target. As a result, the cost of each shot is estimated to be about $75,000 each. But this is still significantly cheaper than a guided missile. PATH OF PROGRESS The first clues to the gun’s existence appeared in late January 2018 when the ship was pictured on the Yangtze River at the Wuchang Shipyard. In March, the state-controlled China Daily news service declared Beijing was “making notable achievements on advanced weapons, including sea tests of electromagnetic railguns”.

In June, a US naval intelligence report claimed the Chinese gun had proven capable of firing shells at a speed of 2.6km per second. It had been able to hit a target some 200km distant with a flight time of only 90 seconds. The report predicted the rail gun would be ‘ready for war’ by 20205. EXPLORE MORE: China’s rapid military evolution The claims sound impressive. But they are yet to be verified. But China and Russia’s determination to lead the world in this new weaponry cannot be denied. The United States — and even Australia — have also been testing and developing hypersonic vehicles. The US Navy has been testing its own rail gun (land based, for the moment) for about a decade. It wants a gun capable of firing up to 10 shots per minute, without the barrel-wear associated with chemical propellants. But there have been problems. Power generation, the size and stability of its electronics and the resilience of its rails have delayed the weapon’s development. Electromagnetic railguns were going to be fitted to the US Navy’s newest class of ultra-expensive, ultra-advanced Zumwalt destroyers. But even the more traditional 155mm Advanced Gun System cannons it has already been fitted with have proven too problematic — and expensive — to shoot. So the navy is considering replacing them with older, cheaper guns. DELVE DEEPER: How hypersonic weapons will change the face of war Only three such ships have been built. They were designed to generate 78 megawatts of electricity to power future weapons such as lasers or railguns. Beijing says it has built its new Type 055 stealth destroyers to be capable of mounting its railguns. “Though the test rail gun is not the final version of the hi-tech weapon, its size does fit the 055 destroyer, which would become an invincible vessel once equipped with electromagnetic weapons,” the People’s Daily Online declared in February.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "China’s world first: Electromagnetic railgun goes to sea", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Jamie Seidel", "sitename": "news.com.au", "image_url": null, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9518765211105347, "responded_url": "https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/chinas-world-first-electromagnetic-railgun-goes-to-sea/news-story/6e31d167e88308f59ec96332ef1e867b?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+newscomauworldnewsndm+%28News.com.au+%7C+World+News%29", "publisher": "news.com.au", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101230054-00061.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T00:27:22+00:00"}

It was a wild ride.  She’ll be ushering in the Year Of The Pig in an upcoming Chinese film which translates to Peppa Pig Celebrates Chinese New Year.  The wholesome movie, set to hit cinemas on 5 February, follows a Mandarin-speaking Peppa as she joins forces with two kids nicknamed Jiaozi and Tangyuan, both of which are foods traditionally eaten during Chinese New Year.  In a highly relatable turn of events, it sees Peppa attempting to get a three year old boy out of bed.  The film comes after Peppa’s been slammed in China for the past year, after she bizarrely became a symbol of rebellion there.  Often sporting yellow wellies, the character even ended up featuring in gang-related rap videos and tattoos.  Professor Steve Tsang from the School of Oriental and African Studies told ITV News: ‘When a lovely character like Peppa is being used by younger people and sometimes not so young people to pursue ideas and articulate ideas that are forbidden in China, then Peppa Pig becomes politically incorrect and she will have to be taken off the screen.’  However, after Peppa was banned overseas, parents began to unite in their hatred for the character.  The user on the popular online forum known as Mallark asked: ‘Any other parents sick to death of Peppa Pig?’  One outraged Reddit user said: ‘I’m a vegetarian, but if someone made Peppa Pig into a bacon sarnie I would eat it out of sheer spite,’ while someone else stated: ‘I’ve been tortured by it for five years now.’  A teacher joined in with the conversation with a shocking revelation: ‘I used to teach primary. A lot of parents seem to want Peppa turned into sausages.’  Despite her haters, the pig seems well on her way to redemption with her new movie.  We love a happy ending.

{"requested_url": "https://www.techradar.com/uk/how-to/how-to-make-your-email-more-secure", "plain_text": "While instant messaging apps are becoming an increasingly popular means of electronic communication, email isn’t going anywhere soon. Approximately 270 billion emails were sent in 2017, and this number is predicted to hit around 320 billion by the year 2021. Despite the fact that in order to access your email account you’re required to supply your username and password (although Yahoo has attempted to increase security by allowing users replacing the conventional password with an app-based account key), email remains one of the least secure means of communication, and has been likened to sending a postcard – basically anyone along the way who’s interested can read the contents of a message. In fact, email accounts have been hacked so many times at this point that scarily, there’s even a website you can check out to see if you appear on a list of compromised accounts. Hacking aside, emails accounts in general are quite the opposite of private. This stems from the fact that an email is not a direct communication, but rather goes via several intermediaries. A single email message gets passed through multiple servers, including the ISPs involved as well as the email client’s, with multiple copies of the message stored at each server, and further copies on both the sender and recipient’s computer; so even when a email is deleted, there are still plenty of copies out there. Finally, according the FindLaw, email accounts are among the easiest to access by both employers and law enforcement agencies – in the US they lose their status as protected communication after 180 days, allowing them to be produced on demand with a simple subpoena. Email is starting to show its age – the first email was sent back in 1971 – and its various security shortcomings are enough to send users to more modern, alternative means of communication. However, with a few adjustments, your email can be more secure. 1. Password protection The first weak point is, of course, the password, and with examples including ‘1’, ‘P@ssw0rd’ and ‘x’ featuring on a list of 10 common passwords it’s no surprise that some accounts are easily breached. Users also fall into the trap of using the same usernames and passwords for multiple accounts, and this can result in one hack being able to breach multiple accounts. We need to step up our game. Be sure to choose longer, and much stronger passwords – utilizing password software that can automatically generate these can help. Also, accept that relying on passwords alone is inherently insecure, and be sure to enable two-factor authentication. This should ideally be done via an app, and not just via SMS to avoid falling victim to SIM card spoofing. As mentioned above, Yahoo gives users the option to drop the password completely, and now provides a one-time-use passwords on demand via its mobile app for enhanced security. 2. General measures Users need to understand that email is simply not a private communication. This goes double for work emails, which belong to your employer, and which can be inspected as they make their way through a company’s network and servers. Be sure to always confirm that a reply is going to a genuine email address, and not to a spam variant. Also make sure to correctly choose between ‘Reply’ and ‘Reply to all’ when responding to a group email. While email is convenient, cross-platform, and used by just about everyone, it’s worth considering if another method of communication might be more secure. Some instant messaging apps have addressed the issue of message privacy – options include TextSecure for Android, and Signal for the iOS camp. However, even with encrypted apps, there can be issues; the popular messaging app, Telegram, which uses 256-bit encryption, was recently taken off Apple’s App Store due to concerns over child pornography distribution, although it was subsequently reinstated. Even Facebook Messenger allows encrypted messages to be sent, and they’re also permanently deleted so as not to leave any trace. 3. Use a VPN Another option to consider is a VPN, which creates an encrypted ‘tunnel’ to another server, where the data is decrypted before being sent on to the internet. However, while the primary reason for a VPN is privacy, and while it may keep your emails secure from your ISP, your email client will still have an unencrypted copy, so it only offers limited security. 4. Email encryption The best strategy to keep your email private is to encrypt it directly – in some cases, the email client you already use may be doing this behind the scenes. Gmail has been offering encryption as the default setting since 2014 for users emailing through Google apps, or on its Chrome browser. However emails aren’t encrypted if another browser is used, or if the recipient has any address other than Gmail, so this method does have its limitations. Then again, Google has become the Big Brother of the internet, and is known for reading user’s messages, all in the name of targeting them with more relevant ads; there’s privacy, and there’s Google’s idea of privacy. Microsoft’s email client, Outlook, also offers an encryption option. Both the sender and the recipient need to exchange digital signatures, which include the certificate and the public key. The digital signature also includes a digital ID, which confirms the authenticity of the sender. However, this doesn’t work on Outlook.com, nor on the Windows Mail app. There are some email services that have been designed to offer encryption. An example of a free one is the open source Tutanota, which offers mobile apps for iOS and Android as well as browser-based email. The downside is that people you send emails to will either need to have an email account on the same platform, or will have to provide a password to decrypt each email. Another privacy strategy is to not actually use a permanent email address, and instead use a disposable one. Email provider MailDrop offers free addresses for exactly this purpose. Users have the choice of either creating their address, or allowing MailDrop to give them a random one – we got startingsibilation@maildrop.cc on a recent visit. There’s no sign-up or password involved, making it ideal for sending an email to an insecure recipient, although not for receiving mail.

{"requested_url": "https://windsorstar.com/sports/football/nfl/detroit-lions/lions-opt-not-to-renew-cooter-as-club-once-again-looks-to-the-future", "plain_text": "Apparently Detroit Lions head coach Matt Patricia did not need that much time to clear his head. A day after saying he would allow the emotion of the season to settle and analyze everything before making any decisions on his assistant coaches, the club announced on Tuesday that offensive co-ordinator Jim Bob Cooter’s contract with the club would not be renewed. “I’ll always make decisions that I think are the best for the football team and this organization that give us the best chance to win,” Patricia said. “I will never accept losing. I think there’s always a way to win and we will always find a way to win. There are no excuses. We all have to do better.” Cooter was one of the few holdovers from Jim Caldwell’s time with the Lions. Caldwell had a winning record in three of his four seasons with the Lions and was fired by the club after back-to-back seasons of 9-7. Patricia came in and went 6-10 and, barring Caldwell’s four years, the Lions have had a losing record in 13 of the last 14 seasons outside of Caldwell. “Obviously, we’re all very disappointed in the way the season ended,” Patricia said. “It’s not how we wanted to be after 16 games, and we have high expectations and we’ll continue those high expectations. We’re trying to build something here at a championship level and we have a lot of work to do.” The Lions will pick eighth overall in April’s NFL Draft for the first time since 1974, but Sunday’s win over Green Bay cost the team a chance to pick in the top five. “I’ll say this, our players never quit,” Patricia said. “They’re tough. They tried hard. They always competed, whether it was a win or lose situation. So, I’m just proud of those guys for that.” Despite the drop in record, Patricia believes the team took strides forward this season. Rookie Kerryon Johnson became the first Detroit running back to rush for over 100 yards in a game since 2013. Receiver Kenny Golladay looks to have the potential to be a consistent big-play threat. Patricia insists the team is committed to quarterback Matthew Stafford, but the club was still 20th in total offence and allowed 41 sacks while questions remain about the offensive line with guard T.J. Lang possibly headed to retirement. “Obviously, it’s disappointing, every year you want to be better,” Stafford said. “There’s no question about that and every year is totally different. You see it year in and year out with teams around the league. You just have to find a way to be a little bit better.” Defensively Ziggy Ansah, who battled injuries all season, is headed to free agency and leader Glover Quin has also been linked to retirement. Despite several injuries, Detroit was, statistically, a top 10 unit and found a new zest with the arrival of defensive tackle Damon Harrison. “We are just scratching the surface of how good we can be,” Lions safety Tavon Wilson said. “This is just a start. Obviously, we didn’t play the way we wanted to play all the time, but we definitely improved throughout the season. So, we are looking forward to next year.” Next year, for the most part, seems to be the annual rally call for the Lions. Time will tell if this year is again simply talk. “I think my commitment to this team, the fans, and obviously the organization is to continue to evaluate and grow and improve this football team,” Patricia said. “I will take a hard look at every aspect of this team in the next month, couple months, before the team gets back and I’ll do everything in my power to improve.”", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Lions opt not to renew Cooter as club once again looks to the future", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Jim Parker; Windsor Star", "sitename": "Windsor Star", "image_url": "https://postmediawindsorstar2.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/29lions.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9780891537666321, "responded_url": "https://windsorstar.com/sports/football/nfl/detroit-lions/lions-opt-not-to-renew-cooter-as-club-once-again-looks-to-the-future", "publisher": "windsorstar.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101230054-00061.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T01:15:09+00:00"}

Mission scientists from NASA and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory have confirmed that the New Horizons spacecraft conducted a flyby of Ultima Thule, a Kuiper Belt object that's a billion miles beyond Pluto.  Celestial bodies and objects Government organizations - US NASA Planets and moons Space and astronomy US federal departments and agencies US government independent agencies Aviation and aerospace industry Business and industry sectors Business, economy and trade Earth Pluto Science Space exploration Space industry Spacecraft and satellites Although the flyby occurred at 12:33 a.m. ET on Tuesday, the spacecraft is so far from Earth that the \"phone-home\" signal didn't reach us until about 10:30 a.m. ET.  Mission scientists were relieved about the success because there was only one chance to get it right as New Horizons screamed past Ultima at 31,500 miles per hour. This incredible feat was possible because thousands of operations on the spacecraft worked in sync.  \"We've just accomplished the most distant flyby,\" mission operations manager Alice Bowman said. \"This science will help us understand the origins of our solar system.\"  New Horizons has also sent back a first look at Ultima Thule -- taken from half a million miles out, so pardon the pixels.  This is the best look scientists have ever had at Ultima. Before, they saw it as only a single pixel.  \"It's a better pixelated blob,\" said Principal Investigator Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.  The image revealed that the object appears to have a bowling pin-like shape, elongated and spinning like a propeller. It's also could be two objects closely orbiting each other, but only more data will show for sure. The object is 20 miles long by 10 miles wide.  Expect never-before-seen high-resolution images and new science to come streaming in Wednesday and over the next few days.  \"The data we have look fantastic, and we're already learning about Ultima from up close,\" Stern said. \"From here out, the data will just get better and better.\"  Brian May, the guitarist for the legendary rock band Queen and an astrophysicist, is also a participating scientist in the New Horizons mission. He's particularly interested in stereo imaging for this leg of the mission. He was also inspired to release a new song celebrating New Horizons on New Year's Day.  \"This mission represents to me the spirit of adventure, discovery and inquiry which is inherent in the human spirit,\" May said during the countdown to the flyby. He wrote a song to honor the mission called \"New Horizons (Ultima Thule Mix).\"  And even the US government shutdown couldn't stop NASA from celebrating such an extraordinary feat.  \"Congratulations to NASA's New Horizons team, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and the Southwest Research Institute for making history yet again. In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said. \"This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.\"  What is Ultima Thule?  The object is so old and pristine that it's essentially like going back in time to the beginning of our solar system.  This flyby is the first exploration of a small Kuiper Belt object up close -- and the most primitive world ever observed by a spacecraft.  The Kuiper Belt is the edge of our solar system, part of the original disk from which the sun and planets formed. The craft is now so far from Earth that it takes six hours and eight minutes to receive a command from Earth.  If New Horizons sounds familiar, it's because this is the spacecraft that conducted a historic flyby of Pluto in 2015, sending back unprecedented images of the dwarf planet and revealing new details about Pluto and its moons.  The New Horizons mission was extended in 2016 to visit this Kuiper Belt object. The mission was launched in 2006 and took a 9½-year journey through space before reaching Pluto.  New Horizons flew three times closer to Ultima than it did by Pluto, coming within 2,200 miles of it and providing a better look at the surface. After the quick flyby, New Horizons will continue on through the Kuiper Belt with other planned observations of more objects, but the mission scientists said this is the highlight.  The object was previously known as 2014 MU69. The name Ultima Thule was chosen through a nickname campaign hosted by the New Horizons team.  Thule was a mythical island on medieval maps, thought to be the northernmost point on Earth. Ultima Thule essentially means \"beyond Thule,\" which suggests something that lies beyond what is known. It's fitting, considering New Horizons' pioneering journey.

{"requested_url": "https://www.nba.com/pelicans/news/elfrid-payton-makes-immediate-impact-win-column-pelicans-return", "plain_text": "Elfrid Payton makes immediate impact in win column for Pelicans in return  With his minute allotment exhausted in the fourth quarter Monday, New Orleans point guard Elfrid Payton walked to his team’s bench, making sure to congratulate every teammate, coach, trainer and staff member on the sideline. Payton finished with individual statistics of nine points, six assists and a steal, but the only number he was genuinely interested in was the one displayed after the buzzer on the Smoothie King Center scoreboard: Pelicans 123, Timberwolves 114.  In his return to action from a six-week injury absence due to a broken finger, Payton reiterated numerous times Monday that his only goal was to help New Orleans (17-21) post a much-needed victory. It’s something the 24-year-old has done exceptionally well during a hard-luck beginning to his tenure with the Pelicans, who are now 6-1 with Payton in uniform, but just 11-20 when he’s unavailable.  Payton is averaging a modest 9.6 points, 4.6 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game in seven appearances – granted, those numbers are skewed low because he’s had two outings cut short by injury – but his teammates already believe the Crescent City native’s impact is undeniable. On Monday, Payton helped the Pelicans win the first quarter 27-22, just the second time in the last 10 games that New Orleans was ahead after the initial 12 minutes.  “Amazing,” forward Julius Randle (33 points, four shy of his career high) said of Payton returning. “He pushes the pace, gets into the ball on defense, just plays with that aggressiveness that we need. It was really good.”  “It helps a lot, especially with the depth,” said forward Darius Miller, who equaled a career high by scoring 21 points. “He’s a great floor general, he gets guys in (the right) places. Him being back is going to help a ton.”  New Orleans was playing without five-time All-Star Anthony Davis (illness) on Monday, but posted its first victory over Minnesota in the last six meetings due to a balanced offensive attack. With Payton back at the controls of the offense for 24 minutes, Jrue Holiday returned to his more comfortable role, playing off the ball and attacking the Timberwolves’ defense from more optimum areas of the floor. Holiday dropped in 26 points and went 2/3 from three-point range, part of NOLA’s second-best shooting performance from the arc this season (14/25, 56.0 percent).  “The way he gets into the paint and attracts defenders, I pretty much just have to stay in his vision,” said Holiday, who was set up perfectly by Payton on two open jumpers. “To be able to do that, run in front of him, EP is pushing the pace. We ran more than normal today. It was good to have him back.”  At shootaround Monday morning, Payton spoke about his excitement to help New Orleans return to the intriguing potential it displayed during a 4-0 start to the regular season. The Pelicans are undefeated when both Payton and Davis play and have performed extremely well offensively in each of Payton’s five games of logging 20-plus minutes, scoring 131, 149, 116, 117 and 123 points. Asked postgame whether he was pleased with what the Pelicans showed Monday in his first game since Nov. 16, Payton was partly content, but wanted to see more.  “First half, for sure,” Payton said of NOLA building a 63-51 lead. “I’m happy we got the win, but we kind of slowed down a little bit in that third quarter, for whatever reason, and I take part of the blame for that. But I was excited for what it looked like in that first half. I think our pace was good; we just have to sustain it now. One of the toughest things to do in this league is win and be consistent. It’s definitely something we need to work on.”  The Pelicans also must get to work on drastically improving their effectiveness on the road, where they’re just 4-15 this season. However, Payton has not played in an away game since the Oct. 17 season opener in Houston, a blowout Pelicans victory in which he logged a triple-double. Regardless of his individual stat line, Payton’s focus will remain the same as what he described moments after beating the Timberwolves.  “Get a win,” said Payton, who’s trying to reach the NBA playoffs for the first time in his pro career. “Do as much to help as possible. Try to bring intensity on defense. Most importantly, find a way to win.”", "published_date": "2019-01-01", "title": "Elfrid Payton makes immediate impact in win column for Pelicans in return | New Orleans Pelicans", "tags": "", "categories": "news", "author": "Jim Eichenhofer Posted Jan", "sitename": "NBA.com/pelicans", "image_url": null, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9816243648529053, "responded_url": "https://www.nba.com/pelicans/news/elfrid-payton-makes-immediate-impact-win-column-pelicans-return", "publisher": "nba.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101143313-00059.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-01T18:22:17+00:00"}

The government said the decision to close the much-criticised facility was “another milestone in the ramping-down of Australia’s onshore immigration detention network.”  Maribyrnong opened in the middle of the last century, but has recently been the site of hunger strikes and other protests over harsh treatment.  In 2017, the Australian Human Rights Commission — a government body — reported guards at the facility used “more restrictive measures than necessary,” including the excessive use of restraints during escort.  The few remaining inmates have now been transferred to other facilities.  Immigration Minister David Coleman said successful policies had reduced the number of people held at Australia’s immigration detention centres from a peak of 10,000 in 2013 to just over a thousand today.  Around 19 facilities have been shuttered since September 2013 — as the government looks to elections that will take place by the end of May and intense debate over immigration policies.  The ruling Liberal-led coalition has faced fierce public opposition to its harsh immigration policies, including the use of unpopular offshore detention camps. — AFP", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Australia closes controversial detention centre | Malay Mail", "tags": "australia, illegal immigrants, detention centre, maribyrnong", "categories": "World", "author": "Published", "sitename": "Malay Mail", "image_url": "https://media.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2015-08/melbourne_0808a-seo.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9694928526878357, "responded_url": "https://www.malaymail.com/s/1708264/australia-closes-controversial-detention-centre", "publisher": "malaymail.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101230054-00061.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T02:04:09+00:00"}

MDC responded to the accusations, saying its reporting was accurate, but today's results may have fed fuel to the fire. While the company's second half of the year sounds more promising, the stock may continue to wallow as long as the short seller cloud is hovering over it.

{"requested_url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2019/01/01/whicker-the-tentative-farewell-of-ohio-states-urban-meyer/", "plain_text": "PASADENA — Urban Meyer lost the final quarter of his coaching career 20-0. It was OK. He raised both fists when quarterback Dwayne Haskins took a knee. He patiently waited for receivers Parris Campbell and Terry McLaurin to give him one last orange-bucket shower.  His wife Shelley, his two daughters, his son and his son-in-law all joined him on the Rose Bowl sideline. He saluted the band and spelled out O-H-I-O with his arms. He said again that he was done with coaching, and Shelley told people that she certainly hoped that was true.  Meyer is 54, and after Ohio State’s 28-23 victory over Washington, he will become an assistant athletic director in charge of supporting new coach Ryan Day. And he will unintentionally cast a giant horseshoe of a shadow. It’s difficult to imagine that the story ends here. “Normally I’d be calling recruits,” he said, describing if his postgame walk felt any different. “And later I’d be checking off who’s coming back, who’s not coming back, and what we have to do to get ready for next year. “I don’t know what tomorrow is going to feel like. I’ve been thinking about that a little bit lately. I don’t know.” His club showed up Tuesday, as it always does. It led 28-3 at one point, with Haskins’ arm and Mike Weber’s legs ripping apart the Huskies’ zone, and with Jeffrey Okudah and the other defensive backs slapping away Jake Browning’s passes and stifling his receivers. Washington rallied and could have gotten within three if a two-point conversion attempt hadn’t been intercepted. Meyer improved to 12-3 in bowl games. Terry Donahue quit UCLA at 51. Bob Stoops and Bud Wilkinson left Oklahoma at 56 and 47. It’s a business that prompts internal hemorrhaging. Meyer has a cyst on his brain that triggers fierce headaches. “I operated under a sense of fear,” he said Monday night, referring to the hair shirt he felt he was wearing when he began coaching Ohio State, even when he won the College Football Playoff in 2014. “It’s not healthy all the time.” Meyer walked away from Florida with two national titles and a visit to the hospital with chest pains. He wasn’t sure he’d return then, either. At the College Football Playoff two years ago, he laughed as he envisioned what the coroner would say at his autopsy: “He’ll open me up and look in there and say, ‘Aaaah!’ He’ll say, ‘Look, there’s that Michigan State game he lost. There’s that Penn State game.’ He’ll see all that damage they caused. You never recover from it.” But Meyer leaves with an asterisk. His school dealt him a three-game suspension in August. A rogue assistant coach, Zach Smith, was ordered to stay away from his wife Courtney, who claims he beat her. Courtney shared those incidents with Shelley Meyer. Shelley’s husband claimed to know nothing, then corrected himself. It was the same situational ethic that allowed Meyer to push ahead at Florida when 31 of his players were arrested. These episodes will be in the opening paragraphs of his obituary because that’s the way the world works. They feed the perception that a coach’s success is tied to his venality. The losses leave such deep marks on Meyer because they are so rare. Nick Saban’s record is bulletproof, but Meyer’s Buckeyes are the only team to beat Alabama in a College Football Playoff semifinal. He leaves Ohio State with an 86-9 record. He was 55-4 in the Big Ten. He was 7-0 against Michigan. His first team, at Bowling Green, turned a 3-8 record into 9-3 and beat three Power Five teams. He had a 12-0 team at Utah that won the Fiesta Bowl. Ten times, Meyer’s teams have won at least 12 games in a season, and have put together a 20-game winning streak four times. And he is cherished by the monomaniacal Buckeyes fan base because he pretends its demands are actually reasonable. “I told Ryan (Day) at the press conference,” Meyer said. “You have to beat your rival and beat everyone you play. Every player has to be drafted in the first two rounds (twelve have, in the past six years). No off-field issues, and, by the way, the classroom, you’re dealing with 31 ACTs on the average. So, go get ’em, tiger. “But it’s a place of excellence. I’m not saying we’re all miserable when we don’t win everything, but this year we went 13-1 and fell short of the ultimate prize. We’re one of the programs that should be there.” Urban Meyer’s genius for winning should be there, too. The problem with the concept of winning at all costs is that, sometimes, you’re the one who pays.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Whicker: The tentative farewell of Ohio State’s Urban Meyer", "tags": "Mark Whicker;Rose Bowl", "categories": "College Sports", "author": "Mark Whicker", "sitename": "Orange County Register", "image_url": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LDN-L-ROSEBOWL-010-KB632.jpg?w=1024&h=728", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9770150184631348, "responded_url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2019/01/01/whicker-the-tentative-farewell-of-ohio-states-urban-meyer/", "publisher": "ocregister.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102044831-00062.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T05:05:19+00:00"}
{"requested_url": "https://www.whittierdailynews.com/2019/01/01/ohio-state-holds-off-washington-comeback-in-buckeyes-28-23-rose-bowl-win/", "plain_text": "PASADENA — Washington was always going to need a special offensive performance in quarterback Jake Browning’s swan song to beat Ohio State.  But by the time the Huskies found their groove in Tuesday’s Rose Bowl, it was too late.  The Buckeyes beat Washington 28-23 in the programs’ first-ever Rose Bowl meeting, holding off a fourth-quarter charge by the Huskies.  It wasn’t until the second play of the fourth quarter that Washington finally found itself in the red zone, a drive that ended with running back Myles Gaskin taking a direct snap and throwing it to tight end Drew Sample for a 2-yard touchdown.  Gaskin found the end zone himself two drives later on a pitch from Browning, cutting the Ohio State lead to 11 with 6:42 to play.  After Ohio State (13-1) couldn’t pick up a first down on its next two drives, Washington got down to the goal line, in part thanks to two pass interference penalties on the Buckeyes. Browning pitched the ball to Gaskin, who ran to the right and as he was tackled and reached the ball out over the pylon.  The call on the field was a touchdown, and it was upheld after a video review, to the dismay of the Ohio State fans in the crowd of 91,853. The Buckeyes’ lead was down to five with 42 seconds to play.  But Ohio State’s Brendon White intercepted the two-point conversion attempt and the Buckeyes recovered the onside kick to cement the win, with Coach Urban Meyer lifting his arms in celebration as Ohio State secured the ball to wrap up the final game of Meyer’s seven-year tenure.  “I’m a very blessed man,” Meyer said. “I’m blessed because of my family, (but) this team, this year, I love this group as much as any I’ve ever had.” The 54-year-old coach is walking away after going 83-9 at Ohio State with one national championship, three Big Ten titles and this Rose Bowl victory, the Buckeyes’ eighth overall in the Granddaddy of Them All.  Meyer cited his health last month in his decision to step down. A cyst in Meyer’s brain causes severe headaches that are even worse in a high-stress job.  If you told Washington (10-4) before the game that it wouldn’t let Browning get sacked in the first half, it would have sounded like the beginnings of a winning formula against the vaunted Ohio State pass rush. But for how good the protection – and Browning’s occasional Houdini act – was, the rest of the offense didn’t meet that standard.  Ohio State stuck to its plan, which was to hold the Washington run game in check – 42 yards on 12 first-half carries. Without the ground attack, Washington found itself in third-and-long too often.  Even when Washington was able to sustain a drive into Ohio State territory, the Buckeyes always answered the call. Twice cornerback Jeffrey Okudah came up with critical pass breakups, the second a diving swat on fourth down after which Okudah ran across the field wildly waving his arms in celebration.  In the end, Washington’s offensive output just wasn’t going to cut it against the seventh-ranked scoring offense in the country, and an Ohio State team determined to deliver Meyer a win in the final game before his retirement.  The Buckeyes struck first with a 12-yard touchdown pass to LeBron James-favorite Parris Campbell, who found himself all alone in the end zone. It was the first of two first-half red-zone breakdowns for the Huskies. In the second quarter, Ohio State receiver Johnnie Dixon III got free on third-and-8 for a 19-yard touchdown pass.  By the time Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins passed to receiver Rashod Berry for a 1-yard touchdown pass to make the score 21-3 with 14 seconds left before halftime, it felt like Washington had no chance to come back.  At least not with the way the Ohio State defense played on Tuesday night.  Haskins (251 yards passing, three touchdowns) was named the Rose Bowl MVP and Brendon White was named the Defensive MVP.  Browning passed for 313 yards and Gaskin rushed for 121 in the final game of the four-year starters’ landmark careers at Washington, which has lost three straight New Year’s Six bowl games.  The Huskies racked up 266 yards of offense in the fourth, but they had fallen too far behind in their first Rose Bowl game appearance in 18 years.  More to come on this story.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we’ll use ROE to better understand ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN). ManpowerGroup has a ROE of 22%, based on the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each $1 of shareholders’ equity it has, the company made $0.22 in profit. How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders’ Equity Or for ManpowerGroup: 22% = 614.7 ÷ US$2.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2018.) Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders’ equity is a little more complicated. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders’ equity by subtracting the company’s total liabilities from its total assets. What Does ROE Signify? ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The ‘return’ is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies. Does ManpowerGroup Have A Good Return On Equity? One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, ManpowerGroup has a superior ROE than the average (11%) company in the Professional Services industry. That is a good sign. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares. The Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity Most companies need money — from somewhere — to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders’ equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking. Combining ManpowerGroup’s Debt And Its 22% Return On Equity Although ManpowerGroup does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.38 is still low. The fact that it achieved a fairly good ROE with only modest debt suggests the business might be worth putting on your watchlist. Conservative use of debt to boost returns is usually a good move for shareholders, though it does leave the company more exposed to interest rate rises. But It’s Just One Metric Return on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt. But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth — and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company. If you would prefer check out another company — one with potentially superior financials — then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.

Anyone living in the northern hemisphere has a really good chance of seeing this amazing light show.  Here's what you need to know to get the best view of 2019's first amazing meteor shower.  Why is 2019 the best year to see the Quadrantid meteor shower?  Unlike other meteor showers this year the moon is minimal this week as we approach a new moon on January 5.  This means less light reflected that could drown out the meteor shower.  When is the best time to see the Quadrantid meteor shower?  There are signs of this shower from late December until January 10. The peak, however is the third or fourth of January.  The peak this year is around 2am on January 4, meaning you'll have a good chance of seeing shooting stars on the evening of January 3 - the later the better.  What is the Quadrantid meteor shower?  Like the Geminids, the Quadrantids are the product of an Asteroid, rather than a comet. In this case it's 2003 EH1 which is in a solar orbit that takes around 5.5 years to complete.  As 2003 EH1 orbits the Sun it heats and leaves debris in space. When the Earth later passes through these remnants they burn up in the atmosphere with a beautiful light show.  The Quadrantids are particularly interesting as they can appear to be very bright indeed.  How long does the Quadrantid meteor shower last?  Unlike the Geminids, this shower lasts a much shorter period of time. Expect the best view to be in the early hours of January 4. Experts say that the peak will be around 2am.  That means a late night for anyone wanting to see the most impressive part of the shower.  How to watch the Quadrantid meteor shower  You need nothing more than your eyes and some patience. Watch from indoors with the lights off - as long as you can see the constellation Bootes.  These days finding specific star groups isn't hard. Just grab a star map app from your phone's app store and use it to locate the region. Most will let you search for Bootes and will direct you to its location in the sky.  Make sure you do this slightly in advance, because you're going to want your eyes to adjust to the night sky to best see the shower.  If it's not too cold and wet it's worth heading outdoors and lying down to take in as much of the sky as possible.  How many shooting stars will you see in the Quadrantid meteor shower?  Expect around 50-100 shooting stars per hour but remember that if you're in an area with a lot of light radiation (street lamps, large office buildings) then you may only see the brightest.  If possible, escape to the country and you'll be treated to a more spectacular light show.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Quadrantid meteor shower 2019: How to see shooting stars from the UK this week", "tags": "Meteors,Apps,The Moon,Supermoon;Apps;The Moon;Meteors;Supermoon", "categories": "Science", "author": "Ian Morris", "sitename": "Mirror", "image_url": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11704405.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_Geminids-meteor-shower-in-Belarus-Zagorie-13-Dec-2017.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9604335427284241, "responded_url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/quadrantid-meteor-shower-2019-how-13802248", "publisher": "mirror.co.uk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102091151-00063.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T09:59:47+00:00"}

Is this a new rule not to take Anil Ambani's name in the House? Not even AA? Not even BJP member?

My colon cancer was found in 2017, and it returned with a vengeance in 2018. I am going to spend the next year (and the rest of my life) looking at everything that I must be thankful for because there is so much out here to appreciate. But if you haven’t had your colonoscopy or need a new one, DON’T WAIT! Great New Year’s resolution! As director of WALC, I am thankful for the gift of reading because so many folks I know can’t enjoy reading a book and turning the page to find an entirely new world of excitement and wonder right around the corner by flipping a page. As I have written before, my earliest memories of learning to read are vague. I do not remember when I learned to read; I seemed to have just acquired the skill. Since that time, I have taken my literacy for granted, assuming everyone reads with as little effort. All of my family members were avid readers. The houses of relatives and friends were always filled with books. I remember being entranced by the lives of The Boxcar Children and wanted so badly to be Violet so I could make a home for my siblings in a boxcar. I also envisioned myself as a detective following Nancy Drew in all of her mysteriously wonderful escapades looking for clues to solve the next cryptic clue. I couldn’t wait for that rainy summer day when I had an excuse to curl up with my new book in my fort I built out of sheets and chairs. I was lucky and did not have a clue how lucky I was to live in an atmosphere where reading was valued. We know as fact that fourth grade appears to be the watershed year; and if a child is not reading proficiently by this grade, there is a 78 percent chance that he or she will not ever catch up. Literacy is learned. Illiteracy is passed along by parents who cannot read or write. Adults with low-literacy skills cannot be seen as a singular social problem in isolation from children’s literacy. Most “emergent literacy” emphasizes the familial dimensions of early literacy and underscores the connections between child and adult literacy, regarding learning, skill levels, and practices. Statistics from the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) show that: 43 percent of our children fall below grade level in reading; 85 percent of all juveniles who interface with the juvenile court system are functionally illiterate; More than 60 percent of all prison inmates are functionally illiterate; Penal institution records show that inmates have a 16% chance of returning to prison if they receive literacy help, as opposed to 70% who receive no help; and, over 78 percent of inmates in America's prisons cannot read above a fourth grade level. Research continues to show that more often than not children of non-literate adults share the legacy of their parents’ educational, economic, and social limitations. Both parents and children are equally important parts of the learning equation. Low literacy skills are a barrier to effective performance in all of the important arenas of life for adults and their children. That is why it is so important that adult literacy and basic education skills become a national priority that matches our commitment to better schools for our children. Our current national focus on the children’s side of the educational and literacy equation puts enormous pressure on school systems to succeed with children whose parents lack the educational or cultural resources they need to support their children or the school. Balancing the equation requires strategies from our policy-makers, our health, education, labor and welfare system, our prison system, business and industry, and every individual in the community. It is a fact that parents actively working to support their children’s literacy even when their own years of school education are limited are important for early learning. Home literacy practices blended with literacy practices in schools create collaborative literacy practices rooted in a culture or neighborhood. Adult Literacy classes introduce parents to ways of helping children in school and the school curriculum, resulting in greater social benefits. I pray that I will be here this time next year, but we have lived with the nightmare long enough. It is time for us to celebrate living not dying! For everyone, everywhere, literacy is a basic human right.... Literacy is, finally, the road to human progress and the means through which every man, woman and child can realize his or her full potential.” ― Kofi Annan Former Secretary-General of the United Nations.

{"requested_url": "https://news.yahoo.com/impact-healthcare-reit-plc-lon-085439211.html", "plain_text": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we’ll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Impact Healthcare REIT PLC (LON:IHR). Our data shows Impact Healthcare REIT has a return on equity of 6.9% for the last year. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each £1 of shareholders’ equity it has, the company made £0.069 in profit. How Do I Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders’ Equity Or for Impact Healthcare REIT: 6.9% = 13.592001 ÷ UK£196m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2018.) Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. You can calculate shareholders’ equity by subtracting the company’s total liabilities from its total assets. What Does Return On Equity Signify? ROE measures a company’s profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The ‘return’ is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else being equal, a high ROE is better than a low one. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses. Does Impact Healthcare REIT Have A Good ROE? One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Impact Healthcare REIT has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the REITs industry (8.4%). That’s not overly surprising. ROE doesn’t tell us if the share price is low, but it can inform us to the nature of the business. For those looking for a bargain, other factors may be more important. If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them). How Does Debt Impact ROE? Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders’ equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking. Combining Impact Healthcare REIT’s Debt And Its 6.9% Return On Equity Impact Healthcare REIT has a debt to equity ratio of 0.12, which is far from excessive. I’m not impressed with its ROE, but the debt levels are not too high, indicating the business has decent prospects. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders. However, it could reduce the company’s ability to take advantage of future opportunities. In Summary Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I’d generally prefer the one with higher ROE. But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow . Of course Impact Healthcare REIT may not be the best stock to buy.

The Nittany Lions scored 17 points in the fourth quarter, but it wasn’t enough to catch the Wildcats, who capped off their third 10-win season in program history.  How It Happened  After a failed fake punt on Penn State’s opening drive, the Wildcats quickly jumped out to a 3-0 lead thanks to Miles Butler’s 28-yard field goal. On the opposite end of the field, Jake Pinegar missed his 40-yard attempt wide right following Josh Allen’s first of three sacks.  Trace McSorley barely avoided a safety on Penn State’s next series before Lynn Bowden Jr. returned the ensuing punt 58 yards for a touchdown to make it 10-0. KJ Hamler’s 41-yard reception set up a 1-yard Nick Bowers touchdown catch for Penn State’s first points of the game.  Pinegar’s second field goal attempt of the afternoon was blocked to keep it 10-7. Somehow neither team converted a third down in the first half, as the Nittany Lions and Wildcats combined to go 0-for-15 heading into the intermission.  Penn State linebacker Cam Brown was ejected for targeting early in the third quarter before Kentucky scored on a 2-yard Benny Snell Jr. rushing touchdown. The Wildcats extended their lead to 20-7 after another 28-yard field goal from Butler, then Snell became Kentucky’s all-time leading rusher on his 12-yard touchdown up the middle.  McSorley gave the Nittany Lions some life with a 1-yard rushing touchdown, then freshman tight end Pat Freiermuth muscled his way into the end zone for an 18-yard score. Pinegar drilled a 32-yarder to cut the deficit to 27-24 with 4:12 to play. Freshman linebacker Micah Parsons had a game-high 13 tackles in the loss.  Player of the Game  Benny Snell Jr. | Running back  Snell, who’s already declared for the 2019 NFL draft, finished his Kentucky career with 26 carries for 144 yards and two touchdowns.  What’s Next?  The Nittany Lions (9-4) return to State College for spring practice and the traditional national signing day on February 6.  Your ad blocker is on. Please choose an option below.

The 30-year-old, who shot to fame as the runner-up on ITV1’s hit reality TV show The X Factor in 2006, will perform his ‘Back In Full Swing’ show at Viva from 7.45pm on Sunday, January 13. Tickets at the venue, in Church Street in the town centre, range from £24.50 to £29.50 per person. The doors will open at 6pm, and the show will last for around two-and-a-half hours. Ray, from Liverpool, stole the nation’s heart during his X Factor battle with Leona Lewis. Week after week, he impressed with renditions of classics like You’ll Never Walk Alone and My Way. His debut album, Doing It My Way, topped the UK charts and sold more than 300,000 – despite Ray not releasing a single. His appearance will mark his second in the resort in less than a year. Last July, he took the lead role of Don in a production of Summer Holiday at the Opera House. Based on the 1960s film that starred Cliff Richard and The Shadows, it included all the number one hits from the movie, plus additional Cliff Richard classics. Gazette reviewer Nicola Adam at the time said Ray was “altogether perfectly cast for the role – it’s hard to find a singer with range, resonance, and musical abilities equal to Cliff but Ray manages it.” In addition to his performances on stage and on The X Factor, Ray won the fourth series of Dancing On Ice in 2009, and the final ‘All Stars’ series in 2014. A year later, he won the first series of Get Your Act Together. He currently plays Jonny Baxter, a new employee at Esther’s Magic Bean, on Channel Four teen soap Hollyoaks. It marks a return to the small screen for Ray, who played Anthony Murray on now-finished Channel Four soap Brookside, which was set in his hometown, from 2000 to 2003. For that, he won a host of honours, including a British Soap Award for Best Dramatic Performance, and the Inside Soap Awards’ Best Young Actor gong.

People across the UK have taken pictures of the moon and Venus side by side for the last few days.  Less of the planet can be seen, the closer it gets to Earth, but due to it being closer it will appear large in the sky. As it gets closer to Earth it is visible in the evening, then when it passes its closest point and moves away again it is visible in the morning.  Want more news?

On its website, it wrote: \"Due to a worldwide lack of 3D content production, it is no longer viable for Foxtel to maintain a dedicated 3D channel.\" \"Due to the declining availability of 3D Sport and Documentary content, we do not expect to be able to show these types of 3D content via On Demand once the 3D channel is closed down on 27th August 2013.\" But while this may herald the end of 3D broadcast television, Foxtel will still have 3D pay-per-view movie titles available through its On Demand service for those of you who are still holding on to the 3D dream.

{"requested_url": "https://www.canoekayak.com/editors-pick/paddler-resolutions-for-2019/", "plain_text": "Whether you're a weekend warrior, sunset cruiser, or a far-going tripper, there's aspects of our paddling that we'd all like to do more, or less, of in the new year. Here are the five W's any paddler should consider heading into 2019.  WHO: In 2019, who will your next trip partners be? Sometimes there's so much emphasis on places and distance, leisure or suffering, that the personal element is removed. Before a trip is planned, it's good to consider who around you might enjoy your next outing. If you're looking for a portage-laden river trip in northwestern Ontario, maybe your best buddy is due for some suffering. If it's campfires on islands with a sunset view and steaming coffee in the morning, your partner or family might enjoy the escape from the life hustle. For some, a trip on the water might be the best way to bring an old group of friends together. Maybe there needs to be no one at all, and you're due for some solace time on the land. (More on an ode to solo paddling.) WHEN: It might seem obvious, but if you're needing to book time off and lock in dates with friends or yourself, considering a time frame is really important. Depending where you geographically plan to paddle, there's considerations to make. For instance, a trip in the north might be best planned in late summer to avoid bugs and capitalize on the warmest possible lakes. Same applies for the south where a paddle in the early fall might mean longer, cooler nights away from the midsummer sun. Perhaps you're dreaming of a river trip and the question is that of peak water, or low water — because there's no greater burden then showing up to a river that's gone dry for the season, or flooded too high after spring’s melt. If all you're really looking to do in the 2019 paddling season is cruise the sunsets more often, then maybe you'll make a plan on how to access the water as quick as possible when the night is right. (More on inspired expedition planning.) WHERE: There's so many rivers, lakes, and coastlines that our hulls can travel, it's sometimes hard to choose where to spend our time and resources paddling. A few things to consider for the new year are where you've been, what you know, and what your ultimate goal might be. Are you looking to be on freshwater or saltwater? Rivers, lakes, or both? Remote or roadside? Wildlife or pubs? Designated campsites or remote shorelines? One day or one month? For instance, a day-trip down the Black Canyon of the Colorado, outside of Las Vegas, might be the perfect off-season trip with the family. But for others, one month on Lake Superior's north shore, finding secret saunas and the challenges of the worlds largest freshwater lake, might be too alluring. (Read more on extending your paddling trips.) WHAT: Though gear should never be the sole factor when considering a trip, it's important to remember that the gear you own versus the gear you might need could be the difference between your next trip. For a sunset cruiser, a boat and roof racks might be sufficient. A wilderness paddler, on the other hand, might have a heady list of gear requirements, vehicle shuttles, and float planes that are a barrier to their trip. So remember to consider as you dream: What do I need to pull this trip off? (Check out this year’s Expedition 101 series covering gear essentials.) WHY: From non-paddlers, the question of why someone embarks on a paddling trip is often asked. As the year closes out, it might be time to ask yourself this question. Why do paddlers allocate holidays, spend time pouring over maps, and rise early to stay out late? The answer is simple: Paddling is a path to joy and fulfillment in life. After a long day on the water, the sunset feels so rewarding. When the weather outside is beautiful and you've spent all day in the office, a sunset cruise in a favorite waterway creates a certain ambivalence to the trials of daily life. As 2018 comes to close and 2019 begins, spend a minute to rejoice in the journeys had and the moments you've come to cherish. Remember the fog at sunrise, hear the crackling fires, relive those moments spent gliding through beautiful environments our paddles and boats have taken us. Then plan your next trip, because soon, another year will have passed. — Last year, C&K Contributing Photographer David Jackson canoed 2/3 of the way across Canada while photo-documenting the efforts of repeat cross-Canada voyageur Mike Ranta. Then he paddled solo from Lake Superior’s north shore back home to the Ottawa Valley.

{"requested_url": "https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/google-is-primed-to-go-big-at-ces-again/", "plain_text": "Last year at CES, Google set up a three-story Wonka factory of smart home devices. In a massive booth near the Las Vegas Convention Center, the search giant showed off how its Google Assistant could work with everything from washing machines to miniature train sets. There was a giant, voice-controlled gumball machine full of giveaway devices. A big, blue slide spiraled to the ground. Elsewhere at the conference, white-suited Google workers greeted people in booths across the show floor, and the company plastered the words \"Hey Google\" -- one of the trigger phrases for the Google Assistant -- over the Las Vegas Monorail. The message was clear: After years of laying low at the world's largest tech show, Google had finally arrived at CES. The company is primed to go even bigger at this year's show, which starts next week. Before last year's CES, the company had happily stayed on the sidelines and let its manufacturing partners, including Samsung and LG, grab all the attention. Now Google is using the trade show to trumpet its software and hardware, complete with an official stage.  That's because CES has become an important staging ground for the tech giant as it pushes devices to consumers that compete against the likes of Amazon, Apple and Samsung. In the next three years, Google's hardware division -- which includes its Google Home smart speakers, Nest thermostats and Chromecast streaming devices -- could hit $20 billion in revenue, RBC Capital Markets said last month. Google has staked its future outside of its iconic search homepage. CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is going all out on artificial intelligence -- specifically the Google Assistant, a digital helper akin to Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Because the market is still so young, Google is hoping it can attract people to its platforms before they get locked into Amazon's popular Alexa ecosystem. \"This is the Wild West,\" said Brian Solis, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. \"Google has to move aggressively and swiftly.\" Google still has a lot of catching up to do. Amazon's Echo devices still dominate the world of smart speakers, with 73 percent of the market. Google's Home devices come in second with 24 percent, according to a report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, though the research firm notes Google is \"making strides.\" It's why CES is so important, providing the ideal venue for drumming up enthusiasm for its voice assistant. Last year, Google used CES to unveil four new Assistant-enabled video devices made by Sony, Samsung-owned JBL, LG and Lenovo. This year, Google is also expected to showcase devices made by third-party partners that have the Assistant built in. And here's another bit of evidence that Google wants to make an even bigger splash at CES this year: The company's presence at CES this year will be triple the size it was last year, a Google spokesman said. A glance at a map provided by the Consumer Technology Association, which oversees CES, shows Google's booth this year dwarfs the one from last year. Stepping it up Google took several steps to up its hardware game last year. In February, Google brought the smart home device maker Nest back under its purview, after it had spent two years as a semi-independent unit under Google's parent company Alphabet. That allowed Google to integrate the maker of smart thermostats, smoke detectors and security cameras into its overall product line. The company has also been steadily expanding its line of Google Home products. In October, Google released the Home Hub -- a smart display that can show people recipes or videos. They're similar to the smart displays the company showed off last CES with vendors like Lenovo and Sony, except with Google-branded hardware this time. Also that month, Google unveiled the latest version of its flagship phone, the Pixel 3. CNET called it \"the best Android phone of 2018.\" It wasn't always that way. Previously, Google's biggest hardware projects included flops like the Nexus Q streaming device and the controversial Google Glass eyewear. But in 2016, Google hired Rick Osterloh, a former Motorola executive, to lead a new division that took all of Google's disparate hardware projects and created a cohesive line of products. Now the suite of products includes everything from virtual-reality headsets to Wi-Fi routers. For Google, the push at CES isn't just about getting more people to use the Google Assistant, said Avi Greengart, an analyst at GlobalData. It's part of a larger plan in trying to make Google services and devices central to every aspect of people's lives, from driving to work in the morning to preparing dinner at home. \"It's a pretty comprehensive vision,\" he said. \"They're not there yet. But no one is.\"  The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.

Prosecutors wrote they were prepared to pursue charges including minor offenses, felonies or misdemeanors, and implied-malice murder and involuntary manslaughter. California prosecutors are poised to charge the state's largest utility company with an array of crimes, including murder and manslaughter if it is found responsible for starting two recent deadly wildfires. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a new filing that if Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which provides electricity to about 16 million customers, was found to have mismanaged or failed to maintain power lines, it would face a wide range of charges. Prosecutors wrote they were prepared to pursue a wide range of charges, including minor offenses, felonies or misdemeanors, and implied-malice murder and involuntary manslaughter. In a statement responding to the filing, the company said it was dedicated to assessing its systems and looks forward to recovery from the deadly wildfires. \"PG&E's most important responsibility is public and workforce safety. Our focus continues to be on assessing our infrastructure to further enhance safety and helping our customers continue to recover and rebuild,\" a spokesman told the San Francisco Chronicle. The filing is the latest in a long legal battle concerning the company that has been overseen by US District Judge William Alsup who asked last month that the utility company explain whether \"reckless operation or maintenance of PG&E power lines\" sparked any wildfires. The company was found responsible for 17 fires last year, and in 11 instances investigators found agents had failed to comply with guidelines for installing power lines around vegetation, one of the charges mentioned in the new filing. The company has until December 31 to submit its written answers to Alsup's questions.

But, temps are expected to rise into the upper 30s by the afternoon, said Cameron. Cameron said a storm system bringing rain will make its way into the state but Friday afternoon and evening as the clouds thicken.

Lloyd Billingsley • Saturday December 29, 2018 10:06 AM PST • President Trump’s travel ban, which the ACLU called a “Muslim ban,” sparked considerable outrage and Hawaii judge Derrick Watson ruled against it. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the travel ban, which restricts travel to the United States from Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Venezuela. Those skeptical about the benefits of the measure might consider another ban that drew less publicity.  In 2016, the California legislature passed Assembly Bill 1887, which restricted state-funded travel to North Carolina over its law specifying which public bathrooms transgender people could use. Last June, attorney general Xavier Becerra announced a prohibition on state-funded and state-sponsored travel to Oklahoma over its adoption law allowing private agencies to decline placement of children with same-sex parents. California’s travel ban now includes Alabama, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas, states with a total population of 57 million. California college sports teams have been forced to raise money from outside sources for travel to states on the banned list.  No state or federal judge issued a ruling against California’s travel ban, and in October the California Department of Justice canceled a review of the restrictions. During the holiday season, Californians might list any possible benefits of this travel ban beyond virtue signaling by politicians. And just for fun, look for states that restrict travel to California for any reason. Might not take long to make the lists and check them twice.  ***  K.

Therefore, it may contain editorial bias or may in some other way not meet our normal editorial standards. It is provided to our readers as a service from The Western Journal.  WASHINGTON (AP) — Days away from joining the Senate’s Republican majority, Sen.-elect Mitt Romney broadly criticized President Donald Trump’s policies and character and argued that the president “has not risen to the mantle of the office.”  “With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable,” the Utah Republican and 2012 presidential nominee wrote in a Washington Post op-ed posted online Tuesday night. “And it is in this province where the incumbent’s shortfall has been most glaring.”  Romney’s biting public assessment came as Trump and Senate Republicans faced a new governing dynamic. Republicans on Thursday will cede control of the House to Democrats, who were prepared to oppose Trump on a number of policies and promised a slew of investigations into his actions and those of his aides and campaign officials, particularly with regard to Russia’s election meddling.  Advertisement - story continues below  Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, had criticized Trump before — notably, in a March 2016 speech he called Trump a “fraud” and opposed his bid for the GOP nomination — but later he made peace with the president-elect and even expressed interest in joining his administration.  Romney’s rebuke of Trump drew a cutting reply from Brad Parscale, Trump’s campaign manager. In a tweet Tuesday night, Parscale said Romney “lacked the ability to save this nation” and contended that Trump “has saved it.”  “Jealously is a drink best served warm and Romney just proved it,” Parscale wrote. “So sad, I wish everyone had the courage  In the column, Romney offered approval of Trump’s corporate tax policies and efforts to cut regulations, appoint conservative judges and other “policies mainstream Republicans have promoted for years. But policies and appointments are only a part of a presidency.”  Advertisement - story continues below  “To a great degree, a presidency shapes the public character of the nation,” Romney said. He later added: “With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent’s shortfall has been most glaring.”  While saying Trump’s early administration appointments had been encouraging, Romney added that, “on balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.”  In describing a “deep descent” by the Trump presidency in December, Romney cited the departures of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly and what he called the appointment of people of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies, and Trump’s “thoughtless claim that America has long been a ‘sucker’ in world affairs.”  Looking ahead, Romney wrote that he would act as he would with any president from either party in the White House, supporting policies he believes are in the best interest of the country and his state and opposing those that are not. And he said he didn’t intend to comment on every tweet or fault.  “But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,” he said.

The New Year is a great time to make some horticultural resolutions that will benefit any landscape. Let’s look at some tips, techniques and strategies that will make your landscaping experience in Southwest Florida the best in 2019 — we can help! Visit garden centers regularly. You would be surprised how often new materials are brought into a garden center! I go as regularly as possible to make mental notes of what is available and to make some plans for future projects. What are the latest gardening gadgets available? What kind of new shrubs would you like to try? Are the new “packaged for 2019” seeds in as yet? And speaking of seeds, make sure to get on all of the mail order seed catalogs — I have already received several in 2018! Grow more annuals. Annuals offer seasonal color and resilience in planting beds that no other plants can offer. I know that they are “annual” by nature, but a change and refreshing of annual bedding plants is always a task that makes your landscape seasonally pop! Plus, there are some annuals that are especially tolerate our heat and humidity in the summer — portulaca, periwinkle, coleus, etc., and those that thrive in our winter months such as snapdragons, pansies, calendulas, and petunias. Please see here for more details and inspiration — http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/MG/MG31900.pdf — Gardening with Annuals in Florida. Grow more perennials. Hand-in-hand with annuals, perennials are a must for any landscape. Not only do they live year after year, but they also develop into larger plants suitable for division and cuttings for increasing a planting, or for giveaways. From pentas to porterweed and from beach sunflowers to African iris and bulbine, perennials that flower in an out of season add variety and anticipation each year. For more ideas, please see here — http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/MG/MG03500.pdf — Gardening with Perennials in Florida. Test your soil. Our UF/IFAS soil testing services are very accurate. You can either come into our office and get a form and a baggie, or simply download it from the UF/IFAS Soil Lab website here — http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/SS/SS18700.pdf. If downloaded, simply fill out the form, enclose a check for the correct amount, use a zip lock baggie for your sample and your own small cardboard shipping box — you take the sample as per the form instructions and send it off. There is around a two week turn-around time for the results. We also get a copy in case you need help with interpretation. Enrich your soil. Well-prepared soil is essential, and with the “soil” we have been dealt, we need to help it anyway we can! Regular additions of organic matter is needed to maintain productive growth especially in vegetable gardens. Before I plant or replant my vegetable garden, I add copious amounts of compost — what I make and what I buy — to enhance the water-holding ability of the soil and provide small amounts of slow-release nutrients. For more information, please see here — http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/MG/MG45400.pdf — Soils and Fertilizers for Master Gardeners: Soil Organic Matter and Organic Amendments. Even when preparing a new lawn, you have an opportunity to add organic matter before seed or sod is added. For instance, as per this publication — http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/LH/LH01200.pdf — Preparing to Plant a Florida Lawn — “a general guideline is to add organic soil amendments at a rate of 3 to 6 cubic yards of (roughly 15-30 percent by volume), per 1,000 square feet of area. Do not exceed 6.5 cubic yards per 1,000 square fee t (approximately 35 percent by volume) as there may be issues with soil subsidence as the organic amendment decomposes or excessive soil moisture issues. Organic amendments should be tilled or mixed into the top 6 inches of the soil.” One last thought would be to visit our publication website — EDIS — often! You may have noticed that I have already been promoting EDIS publications within this article. EDIS is packed full of horticultural fact sheets (as well as other topics) on practically every subject matter with good, ready-to-use information specifically geared for Florida — please check here — http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/. Are you ready for 2019? Let the Charlotte County Extension Service help you with all of your horticultural educational needs! For more information on all types of gardening topics, please call our Master Gardener volunteers on the Plant Lifeline on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. at 941-764-4340 for gardening help and insight into their role as an extension volunteer.

{"requested_url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/123105/howards-end", "plain_text": "Few modern fictionists have revealed so robust a sense of the elusive and intangible as one finds in this novel of E. M. Forster's. And the main reason, one decides, is that the author of Howards End has realized the importance of relating even the most tentative conclusion about life as firmly as possible to the whole of life. Many adventurers into cryptic borderlands have seemed to detach themselves from other phases of thought and feeling as if unable to bear the touch of a too crass reality. But Forster stands four square to the \"winds and odors of life,\" presenting a rich complex of characters and reactions from which to evolve the more delicate nuances of his theme. \"Only to connect!\" says Margaret Wilcox, looking deep through the prosaic kindliness and competence of her band. Connect what? Why the gulls and the stars and the the wych-elm and the tender cruelties of love itself with the garage, the motors, the nervous stupidity of Dolly and the middle-aged materialism of Henry Wilcox. To connect ricks of food and over-furnished dining-rooms with a hungry clerk who spends money for concrete and walks alone all night in the country. To see abyss and plains mountain peaks cearly enough to recognize the common elements of all. This is of course an ancient task, ancient and and possibly eternal, but in the story of Howards End is essayed with rare insight and originality. Neither as serious as all this sounds. The book is entrancingly human with much of that deep-running humor that bubbles up from the heart of things. The time is about ten years ago when Pan-Germanism and English Imperialism were being discussed discreetly, but in the same breath. The novel is a reprint, having been published at this earlier date and since then long out of print. An evidence of soundness is the fact that one reads it without any feeling of its having been bowled over by the war. The people are alive. The dialogue is apt and revealing. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are wealthy and spirited young women living in London with their younger brother. With only Aunt Juley to visit them and remonstrate occasionally, the sisters lead an independent existence, concerned a bit consciously over Art and Thought, but fearless and unusually clear-eyed. \"Some ladies do without hotels. Arc you aware that Helen and I have walked alone over the Apennines with our luggage on our backs?\" \"I wasn't aware, and, if I can manage it, you will never do such a thing again.\" These two remarks suggest the respective mental attitudes of Margaret and her elderly husband. But if anyone could connect a Henry Wilcox with a subtler and more far-reaching world than he had known would be such a person as Margaret Schlegel. In spite of her impetuosity she has a sustaining simplicity and patience. She is affectionately tolerant except when she denounces Henry in one splendid outburst at his hypocritical judgment of her sister. The same poise which has kept her indulgent of his blindness supports her condemnation and allows her to spare nothing of the bitter truth. The same intellectual steadiness enables her to pull together the broken threads of life at Howards End. In their helter-skelter eagerness she and Helen had reached a plane of the unseen which had transcended the security of the whole Wilcox clan who with all their capability had never really learned to say \"I.\" Dramatic values are expertly managed. The breadth and casualnese of the approach forms a specious background for the poignant climax which holds one to the last page.", "published_date": "2015-11-12", "title": "The Original Book Review of E.M.

Residents visited St. Josephs' Primary School and Georgetown Primary to watch their Christmas performances, while a number of children came in to the House to take part in festive activities with the residents.  Adam Hesselden, registered home manager of Woffington House, said: “All of the performances have been thoroughly enjoyed by our residents, who are getting out more into their community. “Children from our partnership schools are talking positively about their experiences, as are our residents.  “Residents are engaged in a meaningful activity and throughout the year we have noticed them asking: 'When are the children coming to visit again?'.”  The residents were visited by the head boy and head girl from Bryn Bach, who delivered Christmas cards that the schoolchildren had made for residents.  The 'mini police' also visited from Waunfawr Primary, as well as the Cadets, who joined residents in creating Yule Logs and making more cards to sell at Woffington House’s Christmas Fair.  Glanhowy Primary and St. Josephs pupils came in and sung carols for the residents, while residents also visited St Albans RC High School for a morning of carols, mince pies and bingo.

Maybe it was the absence of Deandre Baker, Georgia’s award-winning corner, who opted to miss the Sugar Bowl before the NFL Draft. Maybe it was the absence of D’Andre Walker, a late scratch for the fifth-ranked Bulldogs (11-3) who Kirby Smart said he would use “situationally” in the days leading up to the game. Or Jordan Davis, Georgia’s freshman defensive lineman with 25 tackles on the year.  Whatever it was, it didn’t matter. Because no. 15 Texas (10-3) came out looking like a team with something to prove, while the Bulldogs barely mustered a whimper in a game that, for what seemed like the first time in ages, their fans were not in the majority.

Act now!  #ReadLocal  In the end, it was Sam Ehlinger lighting up the stat book. Not Jake Fromm, after a career-best performance against Alabama a month earlier. The Longhorns’ Super Bowl was, in fact, the Bulldogs’ Independence Bowl. It showed, as the 28-21 final wasn’t nearly indicative of just how dominant the Longhorns were on a dark, foggy night in the French Quarter.  “They played more physical than us, and it showed to me that they wanted it more than we did,” Bulldogs head coach Kirby Smart said. “And you’ve got to give them credit for that. ... (Ehlinger) really hurt us. We missed tackles and didn’t finish on him defensively. And then we weren’t really able to run the ball like we like to consistently, and give Texas credit (for that).”  Ehlinger, the Longhorns’ dual-threat quarterback dealing with his own injury, showed little sign of pain. Any doubt he’d be hindered was gone after the game’s opening drive, which he capped with a two-yard touchdown scramble. It was 17-0 faster than the Redcoat Band could make it to its seats, thanks to another Ehlinger scramble — this from nine yards out — and a Cameron Dicker field goal.  The 20-7 halftime score, really, didn’t do Texas enough credit. Because it could have been much, much worse.  Fromm’s interception on the Bulldogs’ opening second-half drive proved that. He actually had a man streaking open behind the Longhorn secondary, but threw off his foot and right into the hands of P.J. Locke III. And it didn’t get much better from there.  “Our No. 1 goal coming to New Orleans to participate in the Sugar Bowl was to win the game,” Texas head coach Tom Herman said. “We weren’t just happy being here. We were going to win the game, and we were going to do everything that it took to win it.”  A nightmare start  It took less than 15 minutes for the Bulldogs to find themselves in a 17-0 hole.  The Longhorns drove 75 yards in just 10 plays on their opening possession, then six yards (after Swift’s fumble) on their next. Then 12 yards for a touchdown, after Jake Camarda’s knee hit the ground before he got the punt off.  A two-score game at halftime, ultimately, meant little for a Bulldogs team that couldn’t score points nor keep the Longhorns from scoring. Ehlinger iced the game in the fourth quarter, scoring a quarterback sneak from a yard out and following with a back-shoulder throw to Collin Johnson for the two-point conversion.  For Georgia, the exact opposite:  Sluggish offense  The Bourbon Street hangover was all too real for Georgia’s offense.  The Bulldogs entered New Year’s Day averaging just over 39 points per game, but mustered just seven in the game’s first three quarters and 14 for the game. Those Tom Herman comments before the game that sent UGA fans into a frenzy — that Georgia’s run game was not “anything too formidable” — were certainly backed up by his team’s defense.  The Bulldogs finished with less than 100 rushing yards, including two Swift fumbles. Fromm didn’t fare much better.  “We pride ourselves in our own physicality,” Herman said. “At this point in our program, that is how we’re going to win games. That is always how we are going to win games.”  Fromm’s fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman felt like a consolation score, despite bringing the Bulldogs back within two scores.  Ehlinger shines in the House of Brees  Facing fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line, everyone in Mercedes-Benz Superdome knew what would happen.  Out of the shotgun, Sam Ehlinger took the snap and bolted forward, lowering his shoulder as he crossed the line of scrimmage. Had his knee hit the ground a split-second earlier, the Bulldogs would’ve taken over. Instead, it was Ehlinger and the Longhorns that could celebrate the game-clinching score.  The Bulldogs knew it was coming in that situation, but they couldn’t stop it. Same goes for most of the night, really.  “He’s a good quarterback,” said Bulldogs defensive end Jonathan Ledbetter. “Can’t take that away from him. He threw touchdowns, and he’s good running. He’s a running back that can throw the ball. We didn’t contain. We didn’t have a level pass rush most of the time. And we didn’t get him on the ground. When you don’t do that, he makes plays.”  Ehlinger tore the Bulldogs defense apart, throwing for 144 yards and running for another 64. His three touchdowns all came on the ground, and his favorite target, Lil’Jordan Humphrey, hauled in five balls for 45 yards.  Similar to the likes of LSU’s Joe Burrow and Alabama’s Jalen Hurts, Ehlinger opened the field up with his legs, and slammed the door shut on Georgia’s season.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Longhorns play like team with something to prove, take home win against UGA in Sugar Bowl", "tags": "sugar bowl, score, final, georgia, longhorn, uga, texas, bulldogs, loss, Sam Ehlinger", "categories": "", "author": "Josh Mixon", "sitename": "The Telegraph", "image_url": "https://www.macon.com/latest-news/202g2l/picture223813040/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/AP19002134328676.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9744388461112976, "responded_url": "https://www.macon.com/sports/college/university-of-georgia/bulldogs-beat/article223812925.html", "publisher": "macon.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102044831-00062.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T08:00:09+00:00"}

Photo: The Phnom Penh Post Angkor Archaeological Park continues to generate the bulk of tourism revenue for the country from its ticket sales, despite a hike in admission fee last year, as foreigners marvel at the iconic temple. Local authorities managing the temple complex forecast the figures could touch $117 million by year-end, with about 2.6 million foreigners visiting the Angkor Wat, located in Siem Reap. The temple complex remains the top tourist dollar earner compared to two other famous world heritage sites - Preah Vihear Temple located in Preah Vihear province and the Sambor Prei Kuk Archaeological Site in Kampong Thom province. 'There was a seven per cent growth in tourist arrivals this year and visitors from 193 countries visited the temple and 43 per cent of the total tourists are from China. 'Foreigners still come to see the temple heritage and during peak periods the place is packed. It is even hard to book hotel rooms,' Angkor Enterprise Executive Director Ly Se told The Post. In February last year, authorities raised the admission fees for foreign visitors to the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) world heritage complex to $37 for a single day entry, $62 for a three-day ticket and $72 for a week-long visit. Previously, the fees were $20, $40 and $60 respectively. While tourist dollars continue to flow, policymakers are working on strategies to woo more foreigners as regional tourism is becoming competitive and neighbouring countries such as Thailand, and emerging Indonesia and the Philippines are aggressively promoting their own tourism products to earn tourism revenue. Tourist arrivals at the iconic temple showed a sign of dip this year, to about seven per cent growth, compared to 12 per cent growth last year. Until December 20 this year, 2.55 million arrivals were recorded. 'It is very difficult for us to maintain a double-digit growth every year, people are coming to visit the temple and its unlike going shopping in places like Singapore or Malaysia. We need to expect new arrivals and have to build more infrastructure,' he added.

While they won't break any performance records, they'll see you right for \"everyday computing\" and \"casual gaming\", Samsung says. You can pick up the Notebook 3 with a 14-inch or 15.6-inch screen, while the Notebook 5 sticks with just a 15.6-inch screen. That's with a 720p resolution on the small display and a 1080p on the larger one (the 15.6-inch Notebook 3 lets you choose). Under the hood you've got your choice of 8th or 7th generation Intel processors – you can go right up to an Intel i7 with discrete Nvidia MX110 or Nvidia MX150 graphics, so it is possible to trick these laptops out to a fairly advanced spec if you want to. As yet the RAM and storage options haven't been announced. Room for your fingers Design-wise, Samsung has gone for a familiar, simple but stylish approach. You do get a full-sized keyboard, complete with number pad, on these laptops – so they'd suit someone who has to chew through spreadsheets, type lengthy documents, or do anything else that requires a lot of keyboard work. If you don't need the latest and greatest specs – particularly in terms of screen resolution – then these laptops should do the job for you. As yet we don't have any details on price though, so it's hard to weigh them up against their rivals.

{"requested_url": "https://calgarysun.com/sports/hockey/st-albert-raiders-rally-to-win-macs-tournament-over-lethbridge-hurricanes", "plain_text": "This year’s Mac’s champions feel as if the spirits of five Humboldt Broncos killed in April’s horrific bus crash helped lift them to the tourney triumph. Yes, it has been an emotional year for the St. Albert Raiders. But victory in the 41st Mac’s AAA Midget Hockey Tournament helped ease a touch of that pain Tuesday evening at the Saddledome. “I’m pretty sure we had some extra help,” said Raiders head coach Jack Redlick of former Raiders-turned-Broncos Darcy Haugan, Jaxon Joseph, Logan Hunter, Stephen Wack and Conner Luken. “When you play together, you’re brothers, right? And we can talk about the Raider family — those players grew up with these boys and the extended Raider alumni. I think it’s for the entire organization. “Did it fuel the fire at times here? Sure. You look at our late goals and our comeback victories throughout this tournament.” The most critical comeback came Tuesday in the championship finale against the Lethbridge Hurricanes. Down two goals with about 25 minutes remaining, the Raiders rallied to tie it and win it — on a rebound goal courtesy of tournament MVP Brady Nicholas — 4-3 over the Hurricanes for their first title take at the Mac’s. “The boys needed a spark, and I was just right place, right time,” Nicholas said. “It was a great drive to the net by Erik Boers, and I was just there to put it in. “It’s always in the back of your head,” continued Nicholas, when asked if the Raiders were nervous about the two-goal deficit. “But you don’t have time to worry in these short-term competitions. It’s about harnessing all that energy from the crowd and your teammates, trying to stay positive and battling back.” Hurricanes star Zack Stringer opened the scoring in the first period, firing a high shot blocker side over Raiders goalie Evan Fradette. But moments later on a power play, Brad Adams scored with a backhand in tight on a rebound off a point-shot for the Raiders to tie the affair. However, Tristen Kimmen notched a power-play goal for the Hurricanes with 2.8 seconds left in the period. At 11:13 of the second period, the ‘Canes extended their lead to 3-1 on captain Tayler Miller’s goal, as he, too, scored on the power play. But from there, though, all the scoring belonged to the Raiders. Kye Buchanan netted his second goal of the game, finding a loose puck in close and putting it home to cut into the deficit and make it a one-goal contest through 40 minutes. Tyson Greenway opened the third-period scoring with a goal at the side of the net to make it 3-3 with 11:21 remaining. And then with three minutes left came the winner by Nicholas, lifting a rebound over the outstretched body of ‘Canes goalie Brayden Peters. “Proud dad moment,” Redlick said. “The adversity these guys have gone through. It’s a pretty (thick-skinned) group — very, very proud of them.” The Raiders were full measure for rallies when needed throughout the week, getting game-winning goals late from captain Boers in Games 1 and 2 of the round robin. Then came phantom help in a must-win against the Calgary Buffaloes in Sunday’s final round-robin game, as with 49 seconds left in a tie game, the puck — on a dump-in around the boards — somehow took a crazy bounce out front, eluding the Buffs goalie for an easy tap-in game-winner by Buchanan. From there, they knocked off Edmonton’s Gregg Distributors Canadians 3-2 in a quarter-final early Monday before doubling up the New York Jr. Islanders 6-3 in one semifinal, with Eric Perneel getting two goals in the victory to send them to the championship. Meanwhile, ‘Canes captain Miller scored the only goal of Monday’s 1-0 semi win over the previously unbeaten Saskatoon Blazers. The Hurricanes also shut out the Red Deer Optimist Chiefs in their quarterfinal game, winning 3-0 early Monday. “We were fatigued, for sure,” said Hurricanes head coach Doug Paisley. “St. Albert kept coming. They’ve got a good, heavy team, though. I think they wore us down. For whatever reason in the third, they just seemed to have a little bit more gas in the tank than we did and found a way to get back in the game and get it done. “Really proud of our group — really happy with what we accomplished,” Paisley added. “The last time we won this was 28 years ago, so it would’ve been cool to win it. We were close, but kudos to St. Albert. We talked a lot about Logan Boulet in our room and what he meant to this team when he was here — that was kind of hovering around us a lot. So there was lots of motivation. But they had lots to play for with guys on the Humboldt bus, too.” LOOSE PUCKS Fradette took home the Tony Sharples Memorial Award for top goaltender of the tourney. The top defenceman of the week is the Canadians’ Zachary Douglas. The leading scorer of the tourney was Saskatoon Blazers’ forward Josh Nagy, with nine points. The plus-minus award went to Cariboo Cougars’ Jacob Gendron, with a plus-5 statistic. The most sportsmanlike player is Logan Kurki of the Vancouver Chiefs. The most sportsmanlike team is the Swift Current Legionnaires. The tournament’s most outstanding coach is Blazers bench boss Scott Scissons … The tourney’s first-team all-stars were named as: G Fradette (Raiders); D Douglas (Canadians); D Cade Mason (Red Deer Chiefs); F Josh Nagy (Saskatoon Blazers); F Stringer (Hurricanes) and F Brett Hyland (Canadians) … The second all-star squad is comprised of: G Matt Schoer (Islanders); D Carson Haynes (Hurricanes); D Adam McNutt (Contacts); F Brett Meerman (Red Deer Chiefs); F Cole Nagy (Saskatoon Blazers) and F Griffen Fraser (Hurricanes) … This year’s Mac’s tournament scholarship recipients are: Dominik Cesarz, of the Canadians; Lynden Grandberg, of the Calgary Northstars; Sebastian Eger, of the Regina Pat Canadians; Matthew Vogelaar, of the Hurricanes; and Daniel Keys, of the Fort Saskatchewan Boston Pizza Rangers. With the assistance of the Sutter Foundation and other Mac’s supporters, the eight $1,500 scholarships for post-secondary education were awarded based on academic excellence, community involvement and volunteer activities, role-model characteristics, attitude and a demonstration for future career planning.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "St. Albert Raiders rally to win Mac’s tournament over Lethbridge Hurricanes", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Todd Saelhof More", "sitename": "Calgary Sun", "image_url": "https://postmediacalgarysun.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/Al-Photo-266.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9550970196723938, "responded_url": "https://calgarysun.com/sports/hockey/st-albert-raiders-rally-to-win-macs-tournament-over-lethbridge-hurricanes", "publisher": "calgarysun.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190101230054-00061.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T04:41:43+00:00"}

The neutral country plans to buy three Blackhawks made by Lockheed Martin unit Sikorsky Aircraft, bringing the size of its fleet of that aircraft to 12, it said in a statement. “The standard international squadron size of 12 helicopters will thus be reached and the ability to intervene significantly increased,” the government’s statement said. While Austria does send a small number of soldiers abroad for peacekeeping and other operations, the focus of its armed forces is largely on national disaster relief. “The armed forces are often called on to help in natural-disaster cases such as flooding in the summer or avalanches in winter,” Kurz said in the statement. “With this investment package we want to provide the military with technical equipment and ensure that in cases of natural disasters it can provide support to the emergency and rescue services with the best equipment,” he added. Austria also intends to buy smaller helicopters to replace 50-year-old aircraft that it will soon have to retire but it has yet to choose a model, it added. A deal with a foreign government rather than a purchase directly from a manufacturer is the preferred option for those helicopters, the statement said, without specifying how many would be bought. Austrian media including newspaper Der Standard and state broadcaster ORF put that number at 12, adding that the plan for the Blackhawks was also to buy them from another government. The Bell 429, made by a unit of Textron, the AW109, made by a unit of Italy’s Leonardo, and the H145M made by Airbus are all in the running, they reported. At least one extra training helicopter is also part of the planned purchases, they added. A spokesman for the Defence Ministry, which has been put in charge of making the purchases, declined to comment.

The Gwinnett County Police Department confirmed the tragic incident, which occurred on Dec. 31.  Investigators said Devin Hodges was handling a handgun in front of three other teens inside a cramped “makeshift shed” in Lawrenceville, a suburb of Atlanta.  As he was displaying the weapon, it fired accidentally.  The bullet struck his friend, 17-year-old Chad Carless.  Hodges and the two other unidentified teens started running from the scene, but Hodges stopped himself, according to police, to call 911.  Carless died before police arrived, the statement explains.  • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Ms. McCallion has pointed out that there have been no inflationary tagged increases to the Supporting People (SP) programme over the past ten years. This, she said, has meant a 25 per cent loss in income for the programme, which is geared towards enabling vulnerable people to live independently in the community. Upon taking on the new role as head of the Derry headquartered housing association late last year Ms. McCallion told the ‘Journal’ she feared the full roll-out of Universal Credit (UC) over the next four years in Derry would affect a significant proportion of tenants. Now, in the winter edition, of Apex’s internal newsletter, she has warned insufficient support for the SP programme is another major concern exercising housing support service providers. “The other reality we are acutely concerned about is the delivery of the SP strategy,” she stated. “In recent years funding has been stretched with no inflationary increases paid in 10 years. This equates to a 25 per cent loss in income in real terms. “If services to the vulnerable are not available, many of those people could end up in crisis. “The unpalatable reality is that if the SP ‘component’ is not adequately financed, the impact may well be passed onto primary, hospital and emergency care services provided by Health and Social Care. We believe that crisis intervention is needed now.” Supporting People is the policy and funding framework for housing support services.

But it wasn’t until earlier this week (and after a small push from Facebook) that Google actually got the go-ahead it needed to deploy its tech in the real world. According to Reuters, the FCC granted Google a waiver on Monday that allows Project Soli sensors to use frequencies between 57 and 64 Ghz, which are higher than what is typically allowed in normal gadgets, but still in line with limits dictated by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. The FCC specified that Soli sensors can even be used aboard airplanes, just so long as users and device makers comply with the FAA’s standard rules regarding the use of portable electronics. Originally thought up by students at St. Andrews University, the goal behind Project Soli was to replace things like physical switches or on-screen buttons with virtual controls that use radar sensors to detect subtle hand movements—so instead of pressing a rocker switch to lower the volume on your device, you could just rub your fingers together as if you were playing the world’s smallest violin. This tactic offers some advantages over traditional touchscreen controls, because, since you can already tell when your hands or fingers touch something, there’s no need to add additional haptic feedback or vibrating motors to reassure folks that the device is working. Additionally, Soli can recognize the difference between your hands and objects made out of metal, plastic, or other materials, so it’s not limited just to basic gestures. Earlier, as Google sought approval for its radar-based tech, Facebook reportedly butted in with fears that Soli devices could interfere with the operation of other gadgets. However, after some back and forth, the two tech giants seemed to reach an agreement, and in September, they presented the FCC with a joint statement saying that even though Google’s radars use higher than normal power levels, Soli sensors should not cause problems for other devices. Advertisement Sadly, even though the FCC has granted approval for Google to move ahead with Project Soli, it’ll probably be quite some time before we could see radar sensors installed on a Pixel or Chromebook. That said, Soli might just be the last piece of the puzzle we need to make devices like the Lenovo Yoga Book C930—which features a virtual keyboard instead of a physical keys—actually succeed.

The 63,150 Model 3s Tesla handed over to customers in the fourth quarter trailed the roughly 63,700 average analyst estimate. The company announced a US$2,000 price cut on each of its vehicles to help make up for U.S. buyers now being eligible for only a US$3,750 federal tax credit for the next six months, half what they were getting previously. Tesla shares fell as much as 9.7 per cent to US$300.52 as of 9:36 a.m. Wednesday in New York. The stock advanced 6.9 per cent last year while most other automakers slumped. Whereas Tesla began 2018 with production being the big challenge, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is starting this year with worries about how much of a market is left for pricier versions of the Model 3. The company said more than three quarters of Model 3 orders in the last three months of the year were from new customers, rather than reservation holders, suggesting many consumers are still waiting to buy versions of the sedan at the long-promised US$35,000 sticker price. “This was a good quarter in terms of production ramp and strong underlying demand, but Tesla came up shy of bull expectations and this will be the focus of the street,” Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in an email. “We also believe the $2,000 price cut to help subsidize the lower EV tax credit is a move that was not fully expected.” It will be a few more weeks before Tesla confirms whether it was profitable for a second consecutive quarter, but the company’s ability to sustain a high level of production — it built 61,394 Model 3s and 86,555 vehicles total in the last three months — will go a long way toward that goal. Musk now plans to turn attention to filling Model 3 orders in Europe and China starting in February, which could help offset some of the potential drop in U.S. demand linked to the shrinking tax credit.

Osaka was speaking after recovering from losing the first set of her Brisbane International quarter-final to Latvia’s Anastasija Sevastova on Thursday. The world number five overhauled Sevastova to win 3-6, 6-0, 6-4 and reach the semi-finals of the season-opening tournament. “I feel like right now I’m really confident in myself, and I feel like the off-season training that I’ve been doing is really paying off,” she said. “And I’m not sure if I would have had the same feeling six months ago. Six months ago I hadn’t won the US Open.” Osaka’s stunning victory over Serena Williams at New York’s Flushing Meadows in September sent her profile into the stratosphere, although her breakthrough win was partially overshadowed by Williams’ furious tirade against the umpire. Osaka dropped her opening service game in Brisbane on Thursday, and that was enough to surrender the first set to Sevastova. But Osaka came storming back to win the second with the loss of just five points. Osaka then broke Sevastova’s serve to start the deciding set and was able to hold the advantage, sealing victory with her 11th ace of the match. The 21-year-old has enormous power but said she was tested by Sevastova, who favours angles and deception over brute force, and who defeated her twice last year. “I just really wanted to play this match knowing that I would have long rallies and knowing that she would be hitting tricky shots,” Osaka said. “So for me, this match was really important because I think that I can handle power players pretty well, but for me it is always harder to hit against people like her, because I don’t really know what’s coming next. “So I think that this match was a good confidence booster.” Osaka will now play either Lesia Tsurenko or Anett Kontaveit in the semi-finals and with the shock loss of defending champion Elina Svitolina on Wednesday, she is now the firm favourite for the title. “My main goal is to show consistency and I’m really happy with this tournament so far,” she said. “I (made) the semis or higher in my last four tournaments, so I think that’s something that I’m going to keep trying to do.”", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "I’m really confident of myself in tough matches after US Open victory: Naomi Osaka", "tags": "Sports, Tennis, US Open, Brisbane International, Naomi Osaka, Anastasija Sevastova, Australian Open;Sports, Tennis, US Open, Brisbane International, Naomi Osaka, Anastasija Sevastova, Australian Open;Sports;Tennis;US Open;Brisbane International;Naomi Osaka;Anastasija Sevastova;Australian Open", "categories": "Sports, Tennis, US Open, Brisbane International, Naomi Osaka, Anastasija Sevastova, Australian Open", "author": "AFP", "sitename": "Scroll.in", "image_url": "https://s01.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/103748-vchuksmqld-1540268100.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9816202521324158, "responded_url": "https://scroll.in/field/908069/im-really-confident-of-myself-in-tough-matches-after-us-open-victory-naomi-osaka", "publisher": "scroll.in", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103113843-00071.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T11:46:13+00:00"}

We also celebrate the highs and lows of an extraordinary sporting year for Leitrim with winners on a national and international stages and some truly inspiring performances and in this article, we look back on an eventful year with Leitrim Senior team captain Donal Wrynn. PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR  Coming back after 10 months rehabbing your third cruciate ligament injury takes a lot of character. I think Emlyn Mulligan’s achievements in doing so deserve a huge amount of credit. He completed his recovery with a powerful performance in New York and chipped in with six points in our Qualifier win over Louth.  HIGHLIGHT OF THE YEAR  Winning the Intermediate championship with my club Fenagh St. Caillin’s after a replay. We had been knocking on the door the last few years so it was great for us to get over the line this year.  BEST OCCASION  Leitrim v New York last May. We just about managed to get out of there with the win thanks to Noel Plunkett’s last minute winner but I'm sure from a spectators point of view it was fairly entertaining. It's a great occasion going over there representing Leitrim.  TEAM OF THE YEAR  You would have to give that to the Carrick Hurlers. A groundbreaking achievement for a Leitrim club to win a Connacht Hurling championship.  LOWLIGHT OF THE YEAR  Leitrim's poor start to Division 4 in 2018. Due largely to injuries and player availability we had a very poor start to the campaign. To see real progress for the senior team we need to get out of Division 4. Losing our first three games killed that ambition at an early stage.  WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO IN 2019?  Leitrim's League campaign in Division 4, 2019. A huge number of the panel were under 23 in 2018. I think the four championship games including the nail biting trip to New York will stand to Leitrim in the new year.  Also, for the first time in a long time we have managed to avoid the favourites in the first three rounds so if we can get points on the board early we have a real chance of getting promotion.  ONE TO WATCH IN 2019?  I could name more than a few but for me it would have to be my own club man Ryan O'Rourke. He scored 2-9 in the intermediate championship final replay this year. I think you can expect to see many performances like this from Ryan for both club and county in 2019.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "New York game was an amazing experience for Donal", "tags": "Leitrim GAA", "categories": "National Sports", "author": "Leitrim Sport", "sitename": "Leitrim Observer", "image_url": "https://www.leitrimobserver.ie/resizer/600/315/true/1546439375572.jpeg--new_york_game_was_an_amazing_experience_for_donal.jpeg?1546439380000", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9615069031715393, "responded_url": "https://www.leitrimobserver.ie/news/national-sports/355687/leitrim-senior-football-captain-donal-wrynn.html", "publisher": "leitrimobserver.ie", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102150606-00065.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T15:16:17+00:00"}

Monterey Peninsula Country Club (Dunes course) Seth Raynor (1924) / Tom Fazio, Tim Jackson & David Kahn (2015) The Dunes Course, long been in the shadow of its big brother Shore Course (ranked No. 56) was originally routed by Seth Raynor, who died before construction. It was completed by Robert Hunter, a partner to Alister MacKenzie (who did not participate in the work). In the 1990s, Rees Jones remodeled the course and reshaped holes to mimic the Raynor look. When Tom Fazio was brought in to make the Dunes as appealing to members as the gorgeous Shore Course, he and former associates Tim Jackson and David Kahn opted to give the Dunes a MacKenzie look. Sandscapes now frame most holes, fairways now zigzag around jagged bunkers and nearly all the greens are now diagonal to lines of play. The Dunes Course now lives up to its name. 100 Greatest History: First appearance on 100 Greatest. Ranked on Second 100 Greatest in 2013-2014 (189th) and 2015-2016 (194th). Previous ranking: Not ranked. Panelist comments, Monterey Peninsula Country Club (Dunes): \"A Seth Raynor outing on the dramatic landforms of the Monterey Peninsula is enough of a draw. The Dunes course’s unique architectural features and interesting inland holes, combined with its dunes-dominated ocean holes and recent renovations, make this one of the best courses in what’s one of the best stretches of golf in the United States.\" \"One of the most special clubs in the world with two outstanding courses and outstanding amenities. I’d be happy sitting at the halfway house at the Dunes course all day, basking in the glory of the Pacific Ocean views and this outstanding golf setting.\" \"The Jackson-Kahn team have been able to achieve something that is an important piece of Seth Raynor’s philosophy: large, undulating, fun putting surfaces with possible ground-game approach options. The Dunes courses’s Bentgrass greens are large, with interesting slopes—some unlike any you’ve ever seen before.\" \"Carved out of dramatic sand dunes re-exposed tremendously in recent renovation, significantly improving aesthetics and bringing bluffs into play. Kudos for reducing the amount of irrigated turf and creating firmer and drier turf conditions.\" \"It is interesting to see how two courses, the Shore and the Dunes, which share the same land, can give two very different feels based on the choices of the architect. Tom Fazio and Tim Jackson have done a terrific job in bringing back the \"Wow factor\" to the Dunes Course. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Dunes course is ranked higher than the Shore course some time soon.\" Photos: Courtesy of Jon Cavalier", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Monterey Peninsula Country Club (Dunes) - Golf Digest", "tags": "story,monterey_peninsula_country_club,hugh wilson,u.s. open,Merion Golf Club (East),merion g.c.,top 100 us golf courses,americas 100 greatest golf courses,americas 100 greatest,courses,Pennsylvania,2017_sponsor_porsche,100greatest,course reviews,course photos", "categories": "Golf Courses", "author": "Share this story Facebook Twitter LinkedIn", "sitename": "Golf Digest", "image_url": "https://media.golfdigest.com/photos/5c2b913d7369027d014d81f2/master/pass/79%20-%20Monterey%20Peninsula%20CC%20Dunes%20-%2012%20-%20Jon%20Cavalier.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9405145049095154, "responded_url": "https://www.golfdigest.com/story/monterey-peninsula-country-club", "publisher": "golfdigest.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103113843-00071.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T11:50:37+00:00"}

{"requested_url": "https://www.sunherald.com/sports/college/article223778650.html", "plain_text": "On January 2, 1984, 9-year-old Manny Diaz would never have believed his 44-year-old self would be in the position he is in now.  “Thirty-five years to the day,’’ the new University of Miami coach said Wednesday in his introductory news conference, “that the University of Miami won its first national championship against Nebraska. And for the 9-year-old kid up past his bedtime, watching Kenny Calhoun bat that ball down and watch the Canes storm the field, the fact that I’m here standing in front of you now as the head coach at [UM], if you need any more evidence that is a God story, that’s it.  “And then when you combine the let’s just say unusual events of this past weekend, certainly I believe God’s hand was in this.  “I surely want to acknowledge my family, starting with my wife Stephanie, who has been with me every step of the way in this crazy ride, and just when you think the ride is crazy and you think you had all the crazy you can handle, crazy has a way of saying ‘Watch this.’’’  Premium content for only $0.99  For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.  #ReadLocal  Now, 35 years later, Diaz, the former UM defensive coordinator, is intent on getting the Hurricanes (7-6, 4-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) back to the promised land, which, in this day and age, is known as the College Football Playoff.  Diaz, born and raised in Miami and the son of former longtime mayor Manny Diaz Sr., was officially hired on Sunday, just 10 hours after former coach Mark Richt announced his retirement.  By Monday night, Diaz had fired the entire offensive staff, noting Wednesday how painful it was.  By Wednesday, the Mann Auditorium in the Schwartz Center for Athletic Excellence was filled with various coaches, administrators, boosters and the media — as well as Miami mayor Francis Suarez and Diaz’s family, including his father and grandmother — listening to Diaz’s vision as well as some remorse.  “Those are good men,’’ he said of the coaches he fired. “They’re good coaches and to be honest they were friends. And it is unfair to suggest that any one of them or all of them collectively were the problem. That’s the way it will look. The fan base in coaching wants blood. When it happens they all cheer. That’s not the way it works. If it was always one thing it would always be easy to fix. But at the same time there has to be accountability.” Diaz made it evident that Richt’s pro-style offense, which ranks 112th in passing offense, 104th in total offense and 65th in scoring, would be overhauled with a new offensive staff that he plans to have in place by Jan. 10 — the date the dead period for recruiting ends. He said he has three finalists.  Some of the names that have been reported as candidates include former North Carolina coach Larry Fedora. Former Houston coach Major Applewhite, as first reported by The Athletic, is another candidate.  “The word ‘spread’ has been dragged around to the point where it’s so spread out I don’t even know, as a defensive coordinator, what the word ‘spread’ means anymore because there’s so many different styles of spread offense,” Diaz said, “but what I will tell you is the word I want to be is cutting edge. The word I want to be is modern. The idea that I want to be is an offense that creates problems for the defense, that puts defense in conflict, that presents issues before the snap, during the snap, that forces mistakes.” When asked to explain “what happened’’ this past season, Diaz cited three main negatives: field position, turnovers on offense and the quarterback.  “We got destroyed in terms of field position,’’ Diaz said. “I think I mentioned we were bottom five in the country in average starting field position for the other team and you can even look at the Wisconsin game as a microcosm of the entire year. You just can’t win a game when the other team plays on a 58-yard field. It’s just math. It’s science. This is all analytics driven.’’ As for turnovers, only two Power 5 teams — Cal and Rutgers — turned the ball over more than Miami, which had 26 giveaways. UM ranked 117th nationally out of 129 teams in turnovers lost.  Diaz indicated the quarterbacks, with a combined 14 interceptions, were a big part of the reason UM couldn’t sustain drives.  “The 800-pound gorilla in the room is that you’ve got to play better quarterback,’’ Diaz said. “We have to get the guys on our campus to play a lot better. We’ve got to put them, as much as we can, in the best position for them to succeed. Or we’ve got to find another guy.’’  Diaz said the defensive staff will remain intact. He specifically lauded defensive line coach Jess Simpson, linebackers coach Jonathan Patke, cornerbacks coach Mike Rumph and safeties coach Ephraim Banda. Diaz did not, however, commit to continuing to use Patke and Banda as co-defensive coordinators. Miami will make one more assistant coaching hire on the defensive side of the ball, at which point Diaz said he will sort out the roles for the staff.  Diaz openly apologized to Temple University, where he was announced as head coach on Dec. 13, and to its players.  “When I woke up Sunday morning, as [UM athletic director] Blake [James] mentioned,’’ Diaz said , “I was putting together a staff to lead Temple to a championship... I had every confidence in Mark Richt that he was going to bounce back from this past season... I apologize for not being with you and not being able to execute the vision I laid out.’’  Manny Diaz Sr., sitting in the front row with Diaz’s grandmother, said it was “a really, really proud moment.’’ His son is the first Cuban-American head football coach at UM.  “The family can stay together,’’ the former mayor said. “That’s important too in life.’’", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Thirty-five years after little boy sees Miami win its first title, he becomes its coach", "tags": "Manny Diaz, Miami Hurricanes, coach, football, Hurricanes, Canes, Miami, press conference, head coach, Mark Richt", "categories": "", "author": "Susan Miller Degnan", "sitename": "The Sun Herald", "image_url": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/n5zi81/picture223823210/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MANNYDIAZPRESSERaepf", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9816429018974304, "responded_url": "https://www.sunherald.com/sports/college/article223778650.html", "publisher": "sunherald.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T20:58:26+00:00"}

AR filed an application two weeks ago dragging the minister of industrialisation and trade and the government to court over failure to implement the regulation of the Rent Ordinance 13 of 1977, as amended.  A statement issued by AR last week said the Minister of Industrialisation, Trade and SME Development, Tjekero Tweya, and  the government undertook and agreed not to oppose the application and relief sought therein. The lawyer representing the AR in the matter, Francois Bangamwabo of FB Law Chambers confirmed to New Era that the government does not want to oppose their application and they are willing to establish a rent control board as well appointment members of the board. He stated that this is a draft and not a final settlement offer and they are waiting for the signatures of all parties.  Bangamwabo added that there is a law in place which has to be implemented and that law is binding. He said it has not been repealed or declared unconstitutional by a court of law. Tweya couldn’t be reached for comment and did not answer Whatsapp messages sent to him.  The statement further read that AR agreed to give the respondent up to November 16 to establish a rent control board and appoint members in the agreed municipalities and regions.  “Since we don’t trust the government, having made commitments in the past that turned out to be lies and used manipulative tactics, we will not withdraw our case immediately. This settlement will only be effective when made an order of court because we cannot trust a government whose interest is to protect foreigners and allow the renting population, that is chasing one million to keep suffering while they enjoy the wealth of our country with the whites and foreigners,” reads the statement. \r\nMeetings were held with government, including President Hage Geingob, where promises were made but to date the ministry of trade which is the implementing agency for the establishment of the rental control board and its members, has done nothing about it. Before referring the reporter to their lawyer, AR member Job Amupanda said they reason they went to court is because the government is not trustworthy and don’t stick to their agreements. “We had an agreement with State House. We had two agreements…they keep saying they are going to implement. They call us to nominate members to serve on the board but they didn’t do anything. They don’t take us seriously,” remarked Amupanda.

Late last month, the group announced the ratification of a new three-year trade agreement, effectively immediately and covering the current and next two seasons. The deal, negotiated peacefully, includes 2-percent annual increases in minimum weekly compensation, a higher level of seniority pay for long-term members, and annual increases to retirement, life insurance, and long-term disability benefits. In return, the musicians, members of Local 4 of the American Federation of Musicians, agreed to contribute more each year to healthcare premium costs and to take part in a future healthcare plan review. “Everyone involved feels we reached an outcome that will make it possible for the Cleveland Orchestra to further build on the great momentum that was achieved with the centennial celebrations of the last year,” said orchestra president and chief executive Andre Gremillet. “This momentum will help with continued development of future audiences, increased impact of our education and community programs, and the artistic excellence that inspires and moves audiences in Ohio and all over the world.” The musicians echoed those sentiments, praising not only the substance of the agreement but also the manner in which it was reached, and their supporters in Cleveland and around the world. “Negotiations were cordial and civil, and the parties were able to constructively address a number of issues,” said bassoonist Jonathan Sherwin, chairman of the orchestra committee. “[T]he musicians want to thank our patrons, trustees, and donors…[W]e look forward to what the next century will bring for the Cleveland Orchestra.”", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Cleveland Orchestra announces new three-year trade agreement", "tags": "", "categories": "Life and Culture", "author": "Zachary Lewis; The Plain Dealer", "sitename": "cleveland.com", "image_url": "https://i.cleveland.com/resizer/3cOX3zqD9jjNMzmtKFwAGYuN9CU=/620x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal/public/ZXCJOTRGXBE4TIO26J3SI3AXFU.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.965613603591919, "responded_url": "https://www.cleveland.com/arts/2019/01/cleveland-orchestra-announces-new-three-year-trade-agreement.html", "publisher": "cleveland.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102174131-00066.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T18:20:45+00:00"}

We are concerned by Governor Larry Hogan’s non-binding agreement with the Department of the Interior to exchange 2,481 acres in South Mountain State Battlefield for 512 acres at Oxon Cove Park in Prince George’s County, where a stadium for the Washington Redskins is proposed to be built (“Proposed Redskins site does not go unused, despite what Hogan says,” Dec. 12). The acreage in western Maryland that would be given to the National Park Service is currently preserved battlefield land belonging to the state as South Mountain State Battlefield. The battlefield already is doing an excellent job of preserving, caring for and interpreting the site. There are three newly renovated museum and visitor centers in the park that are staffed seasonally by the state, interpretive trails and regularly scheduled living history programs. If the park services takes over the site, state employees will lose their jobs. The park service already has a maintenance backlog in the millions of dollars that has existed for decades. How can the park service take on the additional acreage and the property management responsibilities that would come with the acquisition of South Mountain State Battlefield without significant additional funding? Where will the additional funding to incorporate, manage, maintain, police and interpret the new area come from? The Central Maryland Heritage League is concerned that should the park be given to the park service, South Mountain Battlefield will be mothballed because of lack of funding, leaving the story of the battle, which resulted in more than 5,000 casualties, untold. All the state and private funding and untold hours of effort that went into making the park what it is today will also be lost.  Maryland already has two football stadiums. We do not need another new stadium to be built on what is now undeveloped green space in Prince Georges County. Oxon Cove is a green oasis and farm museum in an area already bursting with development. It is a limited resource that should be preserved and enjoyed by citizens. Leave the Redskins at FedEx Field and South Mountain State Battlefield in the hands of the state, which has managed it well all these years. Let the park service continue to provide a green oasis at Oxon Cove and not add to already thin resources. Gov. Hogan needs to let this one go. The status quo is what is best for all concerned.

{"requested_url": "https://fox13now.com/2015/01/16/help-my-teens-watching-porn-online/", "plain_text": "Help! My teen’s watching porn online  By: Kelly Wallace, CNN’s digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life.  What happened to Maddie, a mom of two boys, one afternoon has no doubt happened to countless other parents across the country.  Maddie’s computer was out of juice, so she hopped on her 15-year-old son’s laptop. She looked at the history of something she was working on and then, bam. There were links to 40 porn sites with topics too racy for me to print.  “I was freaking out,” said Maddie, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy and her son’s.  She immediately did something she has never done before during her nearly two decades as a parent: called her husband out of an extremely important client meeting.  “I thought, ‘Oh, my God, we need to talk about this,’ ” Maddie said. “There’s nothing I can’t handle with the kids. … This I cannot handle,” she added, remembering how she felt at the time.  “It’s not like Playboy, which your father had hanging around, where you could just see naked women.”  Teen online porn: The numbers  Just how many teens are watching porn online? It seems hard to pinpoint since there aren’t a ton of data, experts say, because it’s tough for researchers to get access to teens when it comes to studies about sexuality.  In one study widely cited in the media, 42% of Internet users ages 10 to 17 said they viewed porn online in the past 12 months.  But 66% of those who said they saw porn online said they weren’t looking for it and saw it accidentally, according to the 2007 study by the University of New Hampshire and published in Pediatrics.  Elizabeth Schroeder, a sexuality education expert who works with parents, teens, schools and organizations, says her first message to parents is that there’s nothing wrong with their children because they sought out porn.  “It’s natural. It’s normal. I hate to say it, but it’s likely to happen with nearly every kid. It’s not just the boys’ story,” said Schroeder, former executive director of Answer, a national sex education organization based at Rutgers University.  Hormones are raging as puberty hits, plus there’s just the curiosity factor, she added.  “The discussion of porn and the acknowledgment that porn exists is so a part of mainstream media right now that it’s impossible to not know about it.”  What’s the impact?  Schroeder says that once parents ask her why their teen would be watching online porn, their next question is typically, “What’s the impact of watching it?”  We don’t really know because there aren’t many U.S.-based data, Schroeder says.  “There isn’t a true causation of ‘I saw this in porn, and therefore I’m going to do it,’ ” she added. “Are there examples of that? Absolutely. Just like examples of kids who saw this violence on TV and … acted on it, but there are so many kids who see the same kind of violence or porn and don’t act on it that we can’t really say there’s a causation.”  In a survey conducted by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy in 2010 in conjunction with Seventeen magazine, 13% of young men ages 15 to 22 said porn influenced their decisions about sex (PDF) — the same number who cited sex education as influencing their decisions.  Cindy Gallop, founder and chief executive officer of the sex education site Make Love Not Porn, which does contain adult content, believes there is a definite connection between the hardcore online porn young men are watching and their sexual behaviors. The 54-year-old has experienced it personally. She dates men in their 20s, she said.  “I realized … that what I was experiencing was a result of two things converging, which is today’s total freedom of access to hardcore porn online meeting our society’s equally total reluctance to talk openly and honestly about sex,” she said.  Talking about sex  Gallop, who gave a 2009 TED talk that has been seen more than a million times and does include some verbal adult content, has dedicated herself to trying to help people of all ages talk about sex “openly, honestly, publicly … and privately in their intimate relationships.”  “Today, very few parents ever bring themselves to talk to their children about sex,” she said.  And very often, parents have no clue about the kinds of things their kids are actually seeing online.  “I say to them, ‘if you want to understand what’s going on here, you need to go online and see what they’re seeing,’ ” said Schroeder, the sexuality education expert.  “And what I say to them is, ‘look at the ads, because sometimes the ads are way more disturbing and distressing than what they’re seeing.’ ”  There is parental control software and pornography-blocking technology, which some parents are relying on to prevent accidental exposure to online porn and prohibiting their children from accessing it intentionally, but even the backers of this technology say it’s not foolproof.  “Technology tools cannot solve the issues alone,” said Clayton Ostler, director of technology for Net Nanny, software that analyzes the content of every page and blocks pornography or other inappropriate content.  “These tools are designed to be part of an overall solution that involves parenting and open conversations about why pornography is not acceptable for your teen.”  Having the talk  Maddie’s husband eventually had a conversation with their 15-year-old during a casual walk and told him there was nothing wrong with wanting to look at porn at his age.  “It’s just that it’s so different now than it was for me … my dad leaving Penthouse on the coffee table in case I was interested,” he said, according to Maddie. “You want to be careful that you are not just wildly clicking around, because there’s scary stuff.”  When parents confront their teens about their online porn viewing habits, it’s crucial not to be accusatory, said Schroeder.  “It’s really important to say, ‘Lot of kids do this. You are not in trouble, but I want to talk with you,’ ” she said.  “I think it’s OK to sit down with a child and say, ‘I’m guessing that since you went on here you have some questions about sexuality. Is there anything you want to ask me?’ ”  If the child doesn’t want to talk about that, which is entirely likely, Schroeder says, parents can leave out a book or a magazine such as Sex, etc., which is made for teens and by teens.  One of the most crucial things that kids need to hear from parents is why they are freaking out about their online porn watching in the first place.  “Here’s what I’m concerned about, and let me tell you why,” Schroeder says parents can say. “The images you are seeing do not represent real life. They’re not made for your age group. However, here’s what there is, so it’s not cutting you off completely.”  Maddie says she still worries a little bit about what her son might watch, but she continues to keep tabs on him by checking his history, which he doesn’t erase.  “There are parents like us who believe that it’s natural for them to be curious but with parameters and caution.”  What do you think is the best way to talk to teens about online porn?

{"requested_url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-hottest-destinations-to-travel-to-in-2019-2019-01-02", "plain_text": "Travel is trending.  On Wednesday, travel search engine KAYAK released its list of the top trending destinations — those places where flight searches have jumped the most year-over-year. And on the list, you’ll find everything from culinary and cultural capitals to gorgeous beachfront hotspots.  Among the big trends KAYAK is seeing: two cities in Mexico landed in the top 5, likely thanks to increased tourism efforts and a growing number of cultural festivals and celebrations, a spokesperson for KAYAK tells Marketwatch. And the Caribbean is making a comeback, following a rough hurricane season. Indeed, The Bahamas snagged the No. 4 spot on the list, with other spots like Turks and Caicos, Aruba and Jamaica also seeing an uptick in interest.  Unfortunately, you’ll likely pay a bit more for travel this year: According to the Global Business Travel Association, flight prices in 2019 will rise 2.6% and hotels 3.7%. Still there are plenty of ways to save if you hope to visit some of these incredible destinations.  Here are the top trending destinations, according to KAYAK  Mexico City, up 73% year-over-year  With its vibrant mix of culture, art, history, fashion and food — it’s got the second-highest number of museums in the world, behind Paris, more than 40,000 restaurants, and was named the Design Capital of the World this year — it’s easy to see why people are dying to visit Mexico City. Plus, it’s affordable: Median roundtrip airfare from the U.S. is very reasonable, ranging from a low of $278 in February to a high of $439 in December, and median hotel rates range from $115 per night in June to $147 in February.  Bali, up 65% year-over-year  Bali is the first and only spot ever to make it on KAYAK’s top trending destinations list three years in a row — and no wonder. Known as the Island of the Gods, Bali boasts world-class beaches with both sugar-white and black sand, spectacular palaces and temples and verdant jungles. Flights from the U.S. aren’t cheap — ranging from about $693 in November to more than $1,100 in June, July and December — but median hotel prices in all months come in at under $200 a night.  Ho Chi Minh City, up 49%  This big, bustling city in Vietnam is an enchanting mix of new and old: high-rise buildings and ancient temples, hot restaurants and traditional markets. Roundtrip flights range from just under $700 to upwards of $1,000, but hotels are very reasonable, hovering at around $100 to $120 a night. Many use Ho Chi Minh City as a jumping off point for exploring the rest of Vietnam, whether it’s a bike trip through the countryside or a lazy trip to the beach.  The Bahamas, up 45%  Though flights can be pricey — ranging from roughly $400 to $500 round-trip — those sugar-sand beaches, crystal blue waters and activities like snorkeling and deep-sea fishing have long made the Bahamas a hotspot for tourists. It’s trending once again as the Caribbean recovers from a rough tourist season. But in addition to a pricey flight, expect to pay somewhere between $300 to upwards of $500 a night for a hotel room.  Guadalajara, up 43%  Hip art galleries, modern architecture, unique cultural experiences and world-class cuisine and tequila are just some of the many draws to this large city in Mexico. Affordability is another: You can often get there for under $300 roundtrip, and hotels in most months are under $300 a night.  Other spots making the top 10 (in this order) include Lisbon, Paris, Rome, Maui and Munich. Hawaii’s increasing popularity may be due to the addition of more flight routes from the East Coast. These European cities may be benefiting from a similar trend, as new flight routes and low cost carriers are driving down prices and making these spots more accessible. Lisbon in particular “has seen a flurry of new flight routes added within the last year from major cities including Washington D.C., Chicago and Boston to name a few,” a spokesperson for KAYAK told MarketWatch.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "5 hottest destinations to travel to in 2019", "tags": "Column: Upgrade, Doctype: 103, Template: Normal, MW-Industry: Entertainment and Leisure, MW-Industry: Travel, Subsection: Travel, Industry: Leisure/Arts, Subject: Travel;leisure, arts, travel, united states", "categories": "", "author": "Catey Hill", "sitename": "MarketWatch", "image_url": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB094_bali_ZG_20190101142750.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9469495415687561, "responded_url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-hottest-destinations-to-travel-to-in-2019-2019-01-02", "publisher": "marketwatch.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102174131-00066.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T18:25:42+00:00"}

It was the first time that women aged between 10 and 50 entered the site in the southern state of Kerala since India's Supreme Court overturned a ban in September.  Here follows some background on the temple and the landmark verdict.  - Gold-plated -  The gold-plated Sabarimala Sree Dharma Sastha Temple complex sits atop a 3,000-foot (915-metre) hill in a forested tiger reserve.  It contains a shrine to Lord Ayyappa, believed to have been the Earth-born son of two of Hinduism's three main gods, Vishnu (in his female avatar) and Shiva.  Legend has it that Ayyappa was found abandoned as a baby. A king of the Pandalam dynasty, which is still active in temple operations, found and raised him.  At 12 Ayyappa revealed his divinity when he emerged from the forest riding a tigress. The boy fired an arrow which landed at the site where the temple now stands.  - No sex or shaving -  Those wishing to visit undergo a 41-day period of introspection and detachment known as vratha abstaining from sex, meat, intoxicants and even shaving.  Only those who have observed the vratha and carry the irrumude, a symbolic offering, can enter the main courtyard up 18 divine golden steps of Sabarimala temple  After this period many devotees, wearing ritual bead necklaces, walk barefoot for dozens of kilometres including, and especially, the final steep climb.  Only those who have observed the vratha and carry the irrumude, a symbolic offering, can enter the main courtyard up 18 divine golden steps.  The sacred offerings, tied in a cloth usually carried on the head or shoulders, include coconuts, rose water, rice and pepper.  - Marriage proposal -  Legend says that the goddess Malikapurathamma asked Ayyappa to marry her. He said he would only do so if first-time devotees decide not to visit him -- which has never happened.  Worshippers celebrate a festival each year when a procession of the goddess is taken to a spot close to the temple three times -- and she is forced to wait.  The reason for Ayyappa's refusal is because of his celibacy -- one of the arguments against allowing women of menstruating age to enter.  The ban lifted by the Supreme Court also rested on the belief -- not exclusive to Hinduism -- that menstruating women are impure.  Women can however access most other Hindu temples in India. Their entry at Sabarimala was taboo for generations and formalised by the Kerala High Court in 1991.  - Legal wranglings -  The Supreme Court order is opposed by supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).  It was one of a string of recent decisions to have eaten away at some of India's traditions, including outlawing bans on gay sex and adultery last year.  The BJP is not in power in Kerala. Instead the state is run by a coalition of left-wing parties which have said they will enforce the court ruling.  But efforts by women to enter the temple in recent months have been angrily rebuffed by Hindu devotees, with police having to step in to escort the women away to safety.  In October, devotees clashed with police who arrested more than 2,000 people.  On Tuesday, tens of thousands of women formed a human chain across Kerala to back the demand for access to the temple. Media reports said some were heckled by right-wing activists.  On November 13 the Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to its decision from January 22, but said that until then its September ruling stood.

Library users no longer have to pay fines for overdue books as part of plans to double the number of library visitors over the next five years.  The abolition of fines, which will also see all existing fines cancelled, is one strand of a plan aimed at giving members more opportunities to study, use wifi, hold meetings, and to use free “hot-desking” facilities to work remotely from offices.  Under the plan, nearly 200 of the State’s 330 public libraries will open for longer, while the public will be able to take and return books when the libraries are unmanned using scanners.  The plan, which will be backed by nearly € 5 million in funding, aims to double library membership from 750,000 to 1.5 million within the next five years.  There are also wider plans to upgrade dozens of libraries, develop digital learning centres in all suitable libraries and position libraries as a community hub.  Dublin City Council said on Thursday people whose membership has been suspended over unpaid fines can have it reinstated by calling to the library, and there will be no fines to pay.  Brendan Teeling, acting Dublin City librarian, said research showed that library fines act as a barrier to membership.  “Libraries are an invaluable resource for all in the community and we want to remove any barriers that might prevent people making full use of them,” he said.  “That is why we are eliminating fines and other charges. Libraries are welcoming spaces where all members of the community can access knowledge, ideas and information, and where people can reflect, connect and learn.  “Research has shown that people view fines as a barrier to membership and usage of libraries. In addition, fines disproportionately affect those on lower incomes and can create a negative association with library use for children.  “There is evidence that library services which have removed fines see an increase in usage following their removal and we very much hope that will be reflected now in our library services.  “We invite everyone to visit their local library during January and see for themselves all that is on offer there, completely free. We can promise that a resolution to use your library more is one you will find very easy to keep throughout the year.”", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Library fines abolished in plan to double membership", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Colin Gleeson", "sitename": "The Irish Times", "image_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.3746307&origw=1440", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9655126929283142, "responded_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/library-fines-abolished-in-plan-to-double-membership-1.3746308?localLinksEnabled=false", "publisher": "irishtimes.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T21:08:36+00:00"}

The group was formed in late 1988 by lead singer Ross Rice, and in 1990 they released a self-titled LP on Columbia Records. Their single \"Me and Elvis\" was a hit in the US, reaching #32 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The band did a club tour of the US, plus a residency in New England, before closing with a SRO show at The Lone Star Roadhouse in New York City. When the subsequent release of the second single was cancelled, the departure of the band from Columbia was inevitable. After moving to Nashville, the group broke with Columbia and recorded demos while searching for a new label. After two more years of touring, mostly in the Southeast US, with an unreleased second record, the band called it quits in 1992. To honor their Memphis roots and fans, Human Radio played a farewell show at The South End in Memphis, the bar where they got their start. Rice went on to record a solo album called Umpteen in 1997.

Forty-two percent of entrepreneurs over 50 started a business to pursue their passion. At the same time, the rate of entrepreneurs ages 20-34 has declined. From Snapchat to Facebook, millennials appear to dominate most startups, but this might be more of an illusion and a media-driven narrative than reality. In a Kauffman Index report, which measures business productivity in the U.S., older generations are actually more dominant in the startup space. According to the Kauffman Index of Startup Activity, more and more people ages 55-64 are becoming entrepreneurs. In fact, the percentage of entrepreneurs ages 20-34 has declined since 1996. In 1996, 34.3 percent of the population of new entrepreneurs was between 20-34. But that number has since dropped to less than 25 percent in 2016. The report also found that the percentage of new entrepreneurs ages 55-64 has risen over a decade, increasing from 14.8 percent in 1996 to 25.5 percent in 2016. The Kauffman Index used three factors to determine entrepreneurial activity: the rate of new entrepreneurs, the opportunity share of new entrepreneurs and startup density. See which state is home to the best city for entrepreneurs. Although many millennials might want to forgo the traditional 9-to-5 job and pursue a career they truly love, so do those over 50. Instead of setting their sights on early retirement, many people are looking to start their own business. In a 2018 survey from Guidant Financial and reported by AllBusiness.com, researchers found that 42 percent of older entrepreneurs started a business to pursue their passion, 36 percent did so to cash in on an opportunity and 22 percent started a business because they wanted to leave corporate America. In addition, 76 percent of business owners over 50 who were surveyed rated their happiness level a score of 8 or above on a scale of 1 to 10. And although launching a startup might sound like a young person’s game, there are more benefits to being an older business owner than you might think — experience, for instance. According to Quartz, this asset can make older entrepreneurs more valuable than millennials, because with it comes knowledge and the ability to eliminate unnecessary errors.

The fourth-seeded Tigers knocked off top-seeded and eighth-rated Lincoln Pius X 51-46 in the opening semifinal at Southeast. The Tigers flipped the script after losing to the Thunderbolts (6-3) by 22 in the second game of the season. “When we got beat by 20-some, a lot of times people wouldn’t want to … but we did want to try to play them again,” Fremont coach Kelly Flynn said. “We know we got to play again (in regular season) now too, so the pressure will now be back on us.” Fremont had better success shooting the ball (the Tigers missed their first 16 three-pointers in the first meeting against Pius X) and defending Pius X’s front court. The Bolts’ Kloee Sander and Alexis Markowski combined for 50 points in the first meeting. They still created some trouble Wednesday, but Fremont, playing a defender on each side of Markowski, held the duo to 26 points. Freshman Taylor McCabe scored a game-high 17 points for the Tigers, who got two big threes in the fourth quarter from junior Emma Shepard, including one to break a 44-44 tie midway through the quarter. McCabe followed with a layup to push the lead to five. Pius X coach Ryan Psota said the difference was the Tigers’ junior point guard. “The difference today I thought was (Sydney) Golladay,” he said. “Her ability to get penetration today versus the first the game was a big difference because she could spot up the other kids for shots.” Fremont (8-2) has won eight of nine games, and that included going 3-1 in the Nike Tournament of Champions in Phoenix. Flynn said that tournament helped prepare the Tigers for the HAC bracket. “We had to play four days in a row (in Phoenix) so we had to use some of our bench,” Flynn said. “We played 11 today and if Mya (Larson) would have been there we would have played all 12. We did talk about that pressure we got to face there. Winning a couple of those games down the stretch, so those kind of games really help when you get in a tight situation.” The Tigers will now play Lincoln Southwest. The Class A No. 9 Silver Hawks worked their way out of an eight-point deficit, tightened the screws on defense and defeated Kearney 44-37. The Silver Hawks finished the game on a 24-9 run. “This group of kids over the last three years has been really good in close games,” Southwest coach Jeff Rump said. “In the end, they found a way to sort of dig themselves out of a hole, stay close, play tough defense and make shots when they’ve needed to. That’s kind of been their trademark.” Kearney (5-5) threw several defensive looks at the Silver Hawks, worked the game into its pace and took a 28-20 lead late in the third quarter on a three-pointer from Elle Dalhgren. Southwest (8-2) adjusted. “We finally went out to our five-out offense, just to get some movement,” Rump said. Hannah Kelle and Skylar Pieper hit corner threes on back-to-back Southwest possessions. That opened things up for senior Jaden Ferguson, who scored 14 of her 18 points in the fourth quarter. “She’s just a tough matchup for everybody right now,” Rump said of Ferguson, who scored 31 points against Lincoln East in the quarterfinals. Junior Adison Wood led Kearney, which was coming off a win against No. 6 Lincoln Northeast, with 17 points. The date and time of the championship game will be determined later after weather forced a delay in the tournament.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Tigers avenge loss to Pius in HAC semifinals", "tags": "fremont high girls basketball, kelly flynn, taylor mccabe, fremont, sport, basketball, silver, jaden ferguson, hawk, jeff rump, tiger;fremont high girls basketball, kelly flynn, taylor mccabe, fremont, sport, basketball, silver, jaden ferguson, hawk, jeff rump, tiger", "categories": "", "author": "CLARK GRELL Lee Newspapers; Brent Wasenius", "sitename": "Fremont Tribune", "image_url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/fremonttribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/a4/da4cb53d-8f51-51b3-b125-e97e000d6cf4/5c2d7cd2c8dea.image.jpg?crop=648%2C365%2C0%2C175&resize=648%2C365&order=crop%2Cresize", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9751223921775818, "responded_url": "https://fremonttribune.com/sports/high-school/tigers-avenge-loss-to-pius-in-hac-semifinals/article_992042d2-7444-503c-837e-5f429f0c2c64.html", "publisher": "fremonttribune.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103044256-00069.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T04:51:56+00:00"}

The two Korah Collegiate and Vocational School students make up Lone Wolf Robotics, an independent team that’s headed to Ontario VRC Provincial Championship in late February. Bariciak and Giroux qualified for the provincial event after taking capturing the excellence award at Northern Ontario VEX Robotics Competition at Sault College in mid-December. The teammates are robotic competition veterans. This is Bariciak’s third year with Lone Wolf Robotics and fifth year overall. Giroux became involved in Grade 4 when teacher Kim Barnes introduced robotics “as a cool other activity to do other than sports.” Now in Grade 9, this is Giroux’s first year with Lone Wolf Robotics. The families of the two students are friends, prompting Bariciak to recruit the holder of the 31st annual Rotary Science Fair Algoma’s best in fair entry. “He’d be the perfect candidate for the team,” the Grade 11 student told The Sault Star. “He is very driven and inspired to work on the team.” Team captain Bariciak also handles programming and robot driving. Giroux helps with the design notebook, detailing structural and programming changes to their robot named Dyson. “He’s just doing a little bit of everything,” said Bariciak. Lone Wolf Robotics has traditionally boasted a roster of three members. Several former members have moved on including Bariciak’s older brother, Terry. The second-year engineering student at University of Waterloo mentors the independent team at tournaments. Tiana Bressan earned a President’s Scholarship from University of Guelph. The award is worth $42,000. She’s studying biomedical engineering. “The commitment to the team really narrows the number of people that you can have,” said Bariciak. She and Giroux average two to three hours daily “and more on the weekends.” During the Christmas break, the pair is putting in full days – a minimum of eight hours daily – complety redesigning Dyson to prepare for the provincial tournament in late February. Lone Wolf Robotics started preparing for this year’s slate of competitions in June – two months earlier than usual. The “very early start to the season” was done with a very clear objective. “This is definitely the most complicated and elaborate game that VEX has seen for the high school level,” said Bariciak. “We knew that we wanted to take an early start in order to have a well-developed bot by the first few competitions.” The team is now working with its third robot of the 2018-2019 season. Dyson is crafted from alumninum and can fit into an 18-inch cube box. The goal for Bariciak and Giroux at the upcoming provincial meet is to qualify for 2019 Vex World Chamionship in Louisville, Ky. The event runs April 24 to May 1 and features about 600 high school teams. Both students have competed at the international event before. Lone Wolf Robotics placed third in its 94-team division in 2017. The environment is “really fun” but also “very stressful,” said Giroux. “It’s really the pinnacle of all the work that you’ve done over throughout the year.” “It’s really a cool experience because you’ve never experienced being with that many teams all at once,” said Bariciak. She wants to compete in the dome, a large stage at Kentucky Exposition Center, for round-robin play of division winners leading to the champion’s crowning. “It’s just crazy with the music and the lights,” said Bariciak. “The atmosphere is like a rock concert. It’s stressful. It’s stressful just to watch.” With “a lot of pressure,” especially on drivers, that’s just “another reason to prepare more,” she adds. Bariciak and Giroux started mentoring three other robotics teams at Korah in early September. The approximately 12 students are in Grades 9, 10 and 12. The pair meet with their fellow students for about 30 minutes most days during lunch break. Bariciak and Giroux offer guidance on constructing “a structurally sound robot,” assist with programming and teach students “the basics” of transferring code used during practices to program instructions for competitions. “There’s really no set of instructions or manual that helps junior teams,” said Bariciak. “We really find that it helps keep them inspired and keep them in the program having a mentor to look up to when they need some assistance.” Bariciak wants to study mechatronics, a field of engineering that includes robotics, electronics and computers, while Giroux plans to focus on engineering and computer science before studying business.

Then the face reddened. The lips began to tingle and the eyes even started to run, just a little bit. The tongue, by now, was on fire and even long after the white flag was raised, the hands began to shake. Such were what I am now coining as the six stages of the 'ze zaal', something of a specialty at Prithi Raj curry house at the heart of Sheffield's trendy Ecclesall Road. It was, amongst friends, the stuff of legends. One even heard a story about some poor soul trying it and having to de-robe, right there in the restaurant, as the heat became too much. Billed on the menu with a 'extremely hot and flavoursome' warning, ze zaal is chicken or lamb cooked with slices of wild west Indian naga in a garlic and ginger sauce. Our waiter warns us that it's around ten times hotter than a phaal, the previous benchmark for a curry that has the potential to blow your head off, and asks a couple of times if we're sure about trying it; something that, I admit, does register as a potential red flag. Full disclosure; I didn't try it. My palette is, for the want of a better word, more delicate than that and, in I'm of the old-fashioned view that food is better when you can taste it, rather than it trying to kill you. But that would make a pretty boring review (what's new, I hear you ask?) so fortunately, I have some curry experts to call on - one of whom apparently gets a masochistic kick out of trying to find the hottest food possible and then conquer it. The guy used to bring ghost pepper sauce out with him to put on his burger, which is the kind of level we're dealing with, and the ze zaal was the natural next step. Out of morbid curiosity more than anything, I had a try. By 'had a try' I mean put the tiniest, most miniscule speck on the end of a naan bread and prayed. The first ten seconds or so, not that bad. Then it hits you. Credit to him, he finished perhaps a quarter of it before giving in. Apparently many others try it but almost everyone fails to finish it; apart from, we're told, one woman in her 40s who orders it regularly and polishes it off with no issues. Probably after a hard day at work fire-breathing or something. Luckily for those of us without mouths made from school-gym asbestos, Prithi Raj is more than just an outlet for those who want to destroy their tastebuds with fire, curry and naan and do, actually, offer a range of curries actually fit and recommended for human consumption. Housed in a narrow corridor of Ecclesall Road, formerly Ayesha’s, Prithi Raj was wholly pleasurable. The place is small without feeling cramped - establishments of this size have a horrible habit of packing tables in, so you end up sharing rice with the party to your left as well as your right - and although a wooden bar could easily make the place look like an 1980s cruise ship, it works here, amongst the wooden floors and glass partitions dividing diners for a feeling of comfort and intimacy. We did wonder aloud, though, whether the glass was by accident or design; one panel is at the bottom of the stairs where waiters bring down food from the kitchen above, and one missed step would spell trouble for the patrons sitting there. Especially if it was ze zaal. But so far, so good. My better half tests the waiter by asking for a recommendation - throwing in something of a curveball by asking for a creamy or tomato-y madras-style dish - and is pleased with the outcome, a shobuz masala with crushed chilli, peppers, garlic and coriander in a hot and spicy sauce. Ever keen to impress her, I redressed the balance with a trusty tikka masala, excellently creamy with a distinctive seasoning to the chicken. The shobuz was given the thumbs-up, for fans of hot curries who are seeking an alternative to madras, and the flavoursome sauce packed a serious kick. For an alternative to the alternative, try the Raj sizzler - chicken and lamb tikka, tandoori chicken, seekh kebab and jumbo king prawn, with a naan bread for good measure. Impeccably presented, the lamb and prawns were easy-going and succulent but the highlight was possibly the chicken chaat starter, with its slight hint of spice and impressive-looking cloud of pastry. The mixed kebab is a staple of every curry place, but only if it’s done well. I racked my brains to remember a better one and failed. And I couldn't even blame the zaal for my temporary memory loss. The bill, for six, came in at a reasonable £153.20 including drinks and the consensus was that this place is well worth a go. Whether you can face the zaal or not.

Kerala’s top elected official, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, told reporters that under the Supreme Court order, police were bound to safeguard worshippers.  “Earlier, women were not able to enter the temple due to certain hurdles. They were able to enter the shrine today,” Mr Vijayan said.  Opposition party activists protest (RS Iyer/AP)  Protests broke out in several places in the state after the women entered the temple, and police fired tear gas to disperse at least one of them.  On Tuesday, millions of women formed a human chain more than 600 kilometres (375 miles) long from Kasargod in the northern part of the state to Thiruvananthapuram, the southernmost city and the state capital, to support gender equality.  The Communist Party of India (Marxist), the ruling party in Kerala, said about 5.5 million women participated in the protest, called by the state government.

{"requested_url": "https://wtop.com/asia/2019/01/critics-bangladesh-vote-opens-door-for-an-aggressive-hasina/", "plain_text": "DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — While Sheikh Hasina is set to begin her third consecutive term as Bangladesh’s prime minister following a landslide election victory, critics say having such an overwhelming majority in parliament could create space for her to become even more authoritarian.  The Hasina-led coalition won 288 seats in the 300-seat parliament in Sunday’s election, amid allegations by the opposition that the voting was rigged. Hasina rejected the accusations at a briefing with foreign journalists a day after the vote.  The new Cabinet is expected to be sworn in by Jan. 10, but members of the opposition alliance, which won only seven seats, said they would not take the oath. In response, the ruling party’s general secretary said by-elections would be held for those seats. This would result in a parliament with virtually no opposition. Over her last 10 years as prime minister, Hasina took up many development projects, from power generation to the building of a seaport, but her record of maintaining human rights was widely criticized by activists and international rights groups. Some of those critics now say her new government could be even more iron-handed and aggressive.  More than a dozen people were killed in election-related violence Sunday, and the election campaign was dogged by allegations of the arrests and jailing of thousands of Hasina’s opponents.  Dozens of activists took to the streets of Dhaka on Tuesday to protest the alleged gang rape by Hasina supporters of a mother of four who had voted for the opposition.  The opposition had blamed Hasina’s government for arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances of dissenters, while the jailing of a renowned photographer on charges of spreading propaganda against the government sparked criticism at home and abroad. The enactment of a digital security law ahead of the election was criticized by journalists and rights groups who said it would choke free speech and media freedom.  The opposition accused the security agencies and the police of intimidation and threats to prevent them from campaigning ahead of the elections, and there were allegations that the Election Commission and other departments overlooked the complaints.  “Sheikh Hasina’s government during its previous term displayed an increasingly authoritarian streak, deeming all legitimate criticism to be anti-state,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch. “The ruling Awami League’s student and youth groups had free rein to bully and intimidate, while civil society faced pressure to self-censor.”  “It was particularly unfortunate that senior officials refused to address concerns of victims, including families of disappeared persons,” Ganguly said.  She doubted that the next government would be more tolerant.  “We remain concerned that a government that has allowed impunity for serious violations like extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances will persist with little tolerance for dissent and constructive criticism,” Ganguly said.  Hasina trumpeted her development agenda to woo voters and said people voted her to power again for the development bonanza. She took up some big projects, including a bridge more than 5 kilometers (3 miles) long, a nuclear power plant and metro rail system for Dhaka, the capital.  But an analyst said it was not a legitimate argument.  “When you say that we’ll give you development but you have to sacrifice your rights, you have to sacrifice your voice,” said Asif Nazrul, a law professor at Dhaka University and a government critic. “Because if you look at the constitution of India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, nowhere is it written that we are going to give you development but forget your political and civil rights.”  Still, Hasina enjoys a lot of support, especially from religious minorities in the Muslim-majority nation who say she has safeguarded their rights.  At the Dhakeshwari Temple in Dhaka, Hindus poured in on Tuesday to pray and get a glimpse of the Goddess Durga, something they say was not possible under previous governments.  “She has definitely unleashed and freed us minorities,” Jayanti Sharma, a Hindu devotee who was visiting from a nearby town, said of Hasina.  While parliament could be without a practical opposition, no major opposition leaders even exist in the country to pose a serious threat to Hasina.  Her archrival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, the leader of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, is in jail. A court deemed Zia ineligible to run for office because she was sentenced to more than two years in prison after being convicted of corruption. Her supporters say the charges were politically motivated.  In Zia’s absence, opposition parties formed a coalition led by Kamal Hossain, an 82-year-old former member of Hasina’s Awami League who served as foreign minister under Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh’s founding leader.  Hossain is a leader of his small party, Gono Forum, which does not have much popular support. Hasina and Zia, on the other hand, have much larger support bases and attract hundreds of thousands of supporters to their rallies.  On Monday, during a briefing with foreign journalists and election observers, Hasina came down heavily on the opposition. In a wide-ranging discussion, she refused a suggestion that she offer her political foes an olive branch.  “The opposition you see, who are they? The main party, BNP, it was established by a military dictator (Zia’s husband, Ziaur Rahman) who introduced martial law in this country. There were no constitutional rights for the people,” Hasina said.  She dismissed questions about the fairness of the election.  “I feel that it was a very peaceful election,” Hasina said. “Some incidents took place, some of our Awami League party workers were killed by the opposition. I’m very sorry for that, but I always appreciate our law enforcement agencies, also our people who were working hard to have this election in a peaceful manner.”  But there have been allegations of widespread irregularities with the election.  On Sunday, The Associated Press received more than 50 calls from people across the country who identified themselves as opposition supporters complaining of intimidation and threats, and of being forced to vote in front of ruling party men inside polling booths.  Those complaints could not be verified independently.  ___  Associated Press videojournalist Al-emrun Garjon contributed to this report.  Copyright © 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

With India set to play Australia on Thursday for the fourth Test in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, skipper Virat Kohli was seen hitting the nets hard at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) and to everyone's excitement, the batting heavyweight received some help from the other side of the border. Salman Irshad and Haris Rauf - the Pakistani fast bowlers who are currently busy playing club cricket in Australia, helped Indian batsmen, including Kohli in the net session. The pace duo sweated it out to make sure their neighbors prepare well before they take the field tomorrow. The background After getting a 2-1 lead in series, India are looking forward to giving a win the series against the hosts in the final Test at the SCG. Earlier in the day, the tourists announced their 13-man squad, which included a few surprises as Ishant Sharma was dropped and Ravi Ashwin, whose fitness is under the scanner, was given a go. Meanwhile, Kohli's men came out for the pre-match practice session in the afternoon to get things going. The heart of the matter Kohli, who owns a formidable record against arch-rivals Pakistan, is one of the most-loved Indian stars all over the world. Budding cricketers of every cricket playing nation dream to bowl to the batting legend, and today, two of the upcoming prodigies from Pakistan got this opportunity. Both Salman and Haris are an exciting bunch of players and they have displayed much of that in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) while playing for Lahore Qalandars. The pace duo seemed extremely thrilled in nets while bowling to Kohli. Here is the video clip of the session where both of them were seen bowling to Indian batsmen: What's next?

Like a developing photographic image, the textures and colors of bark come into view in the increasingly stark winter landscape.  Paper birch isn't the only tree with bark worth looking at.  COLORFUL BARK  Take a look at the spectrum of colors in bark. There are reds ranging from the fire-engine red of the shrubby redosier dogwood to the coppery reddish-brown of the Nanking cherry to the dulled red-brown of Cryptomeria. Individual trees of river birch each have their own bark hue, some cinnamon-brown, others reddish-brown or grayish-brown. If you think pale gray is a boring color for bark, look at the bark of a hundred-year-old beech: The trunk and limbs seem alive enough to start moving.  The bark of some trees is decoratively dabbled with colors. Sycamore is one of the most familiar of such trees, but lacebark pine and stewartia also are worth planting for their bark alone. The pine's bark is richly mottled in browns and greens. Stewartia has a gray bark daubed with cinnamon and dark olive-green.  TEXTURE TOO  Let's not be so wowed by these colors that we overlook barks' textures. Fine, papery peelings curl away from the bark of the paperbark maple and the above-mentioned river birch as their trunks expand in girth. Except for an occasional interruption of warty lenticels, the bark of Nanking cherry shines as if it has been buffed daily with a shoe-shine cloth. The reddish-brown of cryptomeria bark is intensified in warmth as it peels away in long, soft shreds.  The gray bark of the European beech is fine enough to appear uniformly smooth, but rough enough so there is no gloss. It looks like elephant hide, an effect enhanced by the folds and creases at its limb \"joints.\"  OR TEXTURE ALONE  With some trees and shrubs, the barks' textures are a show in themselves. Long, vertical strips of shagbark hickory bark remain attached to the trunks at their middles, their upper and lower ends curling away to create a shaggy trunk from top to bottom. The little blocks of the bark of persimmon and flowering dogwood give the trunks the texture of alligator hide.  American hornbeam, a small understory tree common in our Eastern woodlands, has a bluish-gray, close-fitting bark whose smooth surface is broken up by sinewy ripples. It looks like muscles, and \"musclewood\" is one common name for this tree.  The bark of the hackberry has a subtle yet, to me, very beautiful color and texture. It's gray, with corky warts and ridges breaking up a smooth background. When lit by the low, winter sun, these warts and ridges shadow light on the smooth part of the trunk with a clarity that reminds me of photos of craters on the lunar landscape.  Trees and shrubs are everywhere, so the beauty of bark can be appreciated on sycamores on a city street as well as on shagbark hickories on a woodland hike. The plants I've mentioned are only a few of many with notable bark.  If I've succeeded in convincing you to plant a tree or shrub just for its pretty bark, something you might admire in winter through a window or as you walk outside, then go to an arboretum to see mature specimens. With most plants, it takes some time for bark to develop character. Even paper-birch bark is smooth and reddish brown until age turns it white and peeling.  But time is not wasted waiting for a young tree and its bark to mature; while you're waiting, enjoy the way the smooth bark of young twigs glistens in the light of the low-hanging, midwinter sun.

At the end of the number, he’d declare, ‘And this is me!’ — before finishing in his own voice. Only it wasn’t really him. Not the real bloke who woke up next morning and had his cornflakes, brushed his teeth, fed the cat — the ordinary man. We only ever saw Mike Yarwood the entertainer, and that’s true of all TV presenters. Bradley Walsh would have been comfortable in any showbiz era. He’s as well-known as an actor on Doctor Who and Law & Order: UK as he is for presenting his quiz game The Chase, and he’s a decent singer as well. The travelogue series sees Bradley and son travel 2000 miles across America from Los Angeles to New Orleans Generally, in all these guises, we only see Bradley the old-style pro. When the cameras are rolling, what’s on display is the persona. For a few seconds on Bradley Walsh & Son: Breaking Dad (ITV), we glimpsed the real man, and it was rather touching. The concept behind the series is nothing original — Bradley and his 21-year-old son Barney are on a roadtrip across America, tackling a few strenuous holiday activities, like volleyball on the beach. The locations may be exotic, but their relationship is definitely traditional. Dad’s grumpy, the son is impatient, and they bicker their way from coast to coast in an RV camper van — the current vehicle of choice for all telly travellers. In Palm Springs, they had a go at skydiving for the first time. Bradley insisted he wasn’t keen, but of course he would say that — that’s the ‘crusty old codger’ he plays. In the plane, climbing to 12,000ft, he seemed nervous. Who wouldn’t be, about to try parachuting aged 58? When Barney and his instructor jumped, tumbling out of the door with a whoop, Bradley looked worse than terrified. He wasn’t concerned for himself — he was petrified for his son. The parent’s one unspeakable nightmare, of losing a child, was carved across his face. Doctors Chris and Xand van Tulleken put competing health theories to the test with the help of 30 other pairs of identical twins Moments later he was falling, too, and looking round desperately: ‘Where’s Barnes, where’s my boy?’ And when he saw him, safely floating to earth, Dad sobbed: ‘He’s so great! I wish I was like him.’ That was heartfelt. That was the real Bradley Walsh speaking. Xand van Tulleken forgot his TV presenter’s etiquette for a short while as he got a tattoo on the sole of his foot in The Twinstitute (BBC2). He was testing the theory that swearing helps dull pain, by bellowing Shakespearean obscenities. ‘Gadzooks!’ he roared. ‘Fustilugs!’ Good words before the watershed. Then the needle hit a nerve and the commentary had to be bleeped. This was a brisk half-hour of frothy health advice. Xand’s identical twin brother also had a tattoo, tried meditating instead of swearing and announced it was much more effective. Obviously, the best pain management solution would be never get a tattoo on the bottom of your foot. Other pairs of twins tested whether dieting or exercise was more effective for weight loss, and if methodical study beat frenzied cramming. It was all so light-hearted as to be meaningless, though at New Year, when we’re determined to stick to our resolutions, the 21-stone, beer-loving, middle-aged twins tackling tough weight-loss regimes were an inspiration.

The Panama-registered MSC Zoe shed the containers containing mostly toys, furniture and auto spare parts while battling a storm off the Frisian Islands, an archipelago off the northwestern Dutch coast also known as the Wadden Islands.  The Dutch coastguard tweeted that three of the containers contained, in powder form, highly flammable, potentially dangerous organic peroxides used in making plastics which can cause irritation if breathed in.  German coastguard sources said they had located one container holding organic peroxide among six containers that reached the country's coastline.  They also warned the public not to touch the containers if found, but to call police or the fire brigade.  The Dutch coastguard, which said the containers went overboard not far from the German island of Borkum, added they did not have information about the content of cargo beyond that of the 20 or so containers which washed up on the islands.  Dutch broadcaster NOS showed local people around one of the containers and pictured toys and other materials strewn across beaches as well as one man carrying off a flat screen television.  A Dutch coastguard spokesman told NOS it was likely the containers holding the peroxides had sunk.  A Dutch coastguard plane was due to undertake a new search on Thursday morning while strong winds were hampering the MSC Zoe's own attempts to carry out an inventory.  The mayor of Terschelling island, where some of the cargo washed ashore, told NOS he expected it would take several days to clear the beach of stray items from the containers.  The 2015-built MSC Zoe, which was headed to the northern German port of Bremerhaven, is one of the world's largest container vessels at 396 metres (1300 feet) long and 59 metres wide.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Ship loses potentially dangerous cargo in North Sea: Coastguard - AFP | This Kiji", "tags": "AFP,Netherlands,Germany,transport,accident", "categories": "", "author": null, "sitename": "AFP", "image_url": "https://nordot-res.cloudinary.com/t_ogimage2/ch/images/453267540421936225/origin_1.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9696704149246216, "responded_url": "https://this.kiji.is/453267547636155489", "publisher": "this.kiji.is", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T21:22:10+00:00"}

The issue was taken up in a Cabinet meeting Wednesday that gave a green signal to the modalities for distribution of smartphones.  As per the plan, the state plans to provide smartphone, worth Rs 3,000-4,000, to students who pass their senior secondary examinations, graduating students of government schools, colleges and technical institutes, in the first phase.  Only those students who have never had a smartphone in their name will be considered for the scheme. Self-certification will be required from the students stating that they do not already have a smartphone.  A government statement said the smartphone would have a touch screen, camera and applications to access social media etc. In addition, one-time bundled 12 GB data and 600 local minutes talk time (voice) with a year’s validity would also be provided under the scheme.  The financial implications of the scheme as well as the total number of beneficiaries are not known yet. A government functionary told The Indian Express that the picture would be clear only after bids were invited and tender was allotted to a vendor that would supply the phones.  The vendor will be selected through an open transparent bidding process for which the tender document has already been floated by the Punjab Information and Communication Technology Corporation. Vendors will be on board within two months and the first batch of phones is expected to be distributed in March.  The state is yet to finalise the name of the scheme. The Cabinet authorised the Chief Minister to finalise the name, besides authorising the chairman of the committee for procurement and distribution of smartphones to make changes in the Request For Proposal (RFP).  The Punjab government had announced a scheme named ‘Mobile phones to youths’ in its budget for 2017-18 with the objective of providing digital access to youth and information regarding education, career opportunities, access to skill development and employment opportunities and basic citizen centric services through government applications.  The department of sports and youth affairs had constituted a committee in April 2017 with the objective of implementation of the scheme. The committee was reconstituted in August 2017 and the Department of Industries was made the nodal agency. Punjab Information and Communication Technology Corporation Ltd (Punjab Infotech) under the Department of Industries was designated as the Executing Agency of the Project.  The reconstituted committee decided that a Project Management Consultant (PMC) be appointed to assist in conceptualising the project, preparation of Detailed Project Report and planning and executing other related activities. Punjab Infotech invited open bids for selection of PMC from National Informatics Centre Services Incorporated (NICSI) empanelled consulting organisations. The selection criteria was based on ‘Quality and Cost Based Selection’ (QCBS) and the bidders were required to quote for efforts for the assignment on the basis of fixed NICSI rates. The most responsive bid was found to be from M/S KPMG. M/S KPMG was thus selected to be the PMC at a cost of Rs 72.19 lakh for the duration of the project.  The government was under fire for not fulfilling its ‘smartphone’ promise. It was then decided that before the government gets on the defensive in an important election year, it should roll out the smartphone scheme.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Punjab cabinet approves plan to distribute smartphones", "tags": "punjab cabinet, punjab free smartphones, punjab govt, punjab administration, punjab news, chandigarh news", "categories": "", "author": "Express News Service", "sitename": "The Indian Express", "image_url": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/04/smartphones_india_big_759.jpg?w=759", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9640923142433167, "responded_url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-cabinet-approves-plan-to-distribute-smartphones-5520873/", "publisher": "indianexpress.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102235655-00068.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T00:54:44+00:00"}

The neighbour then called the police emergency number, according to media reports. “Multiple police units responded (with) lights and sirens,” the reports said, quoting from a Twitter post that appeared to have been posted by police in Wanneroo, just to the north of Perth. The post has since been deleted. The tweet showed what appeared to be a law enforcement communication log that included the initial emergency call, followed by an update 15 minutes later that said “police spoke with all parties who advised that husband had only been trying to kill a spider (has serious fear of spiders)”. The log said the man “apologised for inconvenience to police” and that there were “no injuries sighted (except to spider)” and “no further police involvement required”. The reports did not identify the man, or the type of spider. An out-of-hours call from Reuters to the Western Australia state police’s administration number went unanswered.

By Srinath Srinivasan  A market rarely noticed by coders and IT specialists is the market of the compilers. Here, one can find Raincode Labs, a startup enabling large entreprises migrate their codes to various platforms of the present and future, by developing adhoc compilers. \nTalking about why this is rare, Darius Blasband, CEO of Raincode Labs, says, “People have millions of lines of codes developed over 20-30 years. They’re gigantic. Then the platform, the database, the language or the operating system is no longer supported. Even if they are supported, it is not affordable to keep the codes with growing workload. The naive way of solving this business problem is to rewrite the codes, but it is wrong most of the time.” So how do you save a software system that’s under threat? “This is where the business is,” says Blasband. “Mapping a programming language to another may not be possible all the time but what we can do is, provide a compiler for that language which can help enterprises move away from the platform they are currently running on.”  While a few of the largest tech enterprises do this in-house, most others outsource this job. This market appears to be large in South Asia as it is with Europe and the USA, which attracts companies like Raincode Labs to set up offices in the tech hubs of Asia. Last year, the company made a turnover of over $5 million with only minor operations in Asia.  Blasband says that due to the nature of the industry, the business isn’t focused on quarter-to-quarter performance. He is also required to stay with his clients’ business for the next 10-15 years till the compiler stays in vogue. \n“It takes a lot of patience and passion to develop compilers and that keeps most people away, hence the competition is sparse in this market. It’s a really well-paying hobby, to put it in simple words!” quips Blasband. What challenges their business is finding like minded people with in-depth knowledge. Blasband believes that the ones who are extremely talented and passionate, and want to make a living out of developing compilers, invariably find him, somehow. As with any niche market, it requires time to see how players generate a sizeable demand and fight for market share in this space.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Compiler experts Raincode Labs makes code transfer easy", "tags": "raincode labs, tech news, technology updates, tech news trending", "categories": "", "author": "FE Online", "sitename": "The Financial Express", "image_url": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2019/01/it.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9578100442886353, "responded_url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/compiler-experts-raincode-labs-makes-code-transfer-easy/1431931/", "publisher": "financialexpress.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T21:26:54+00:00"}

Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, ‘Don’t tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.’ Xinyi Automobile Glass Hong Kong Enterprises is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of HK$1.2b, which means it wouldn’t have the attention of many institutional investors. Taking a look at the our data on the ownership groups (below), it’s seems that institutions are not really that prevalent on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about 8328. What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Xinyi Automobile Glass Hong Kong Enterprises? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Less than 5% of Xinyi Automobile Glass Hong Kong Enterprises is held by institutional investors. This suggests that some funds have the company in their sights, but many have not yet bought shares in it. If the business gets stronger from here, we could see a situation where more institutions are keen to buy. We sometimes see a rising share price when a few big institutions want to buy a certain stock at the same time. The history of earnings and revenue, which you can see below, could be helpful in considering if more institutional investors will want the stock. Of course, there are plenty of other factors to consider, too. We note that hedge funds don’t have a meaningful investment in Xinyi Automobile Glass Hong Kong Enterprises. As far I can tell there isn’t analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar. Insider Ownership Of Xinyi Automobile Glass Hong Kong Enterprises The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own the majority of Xinyi Automobile Glass Hong Kong Enterprises Limited. This means they can collectively make decisions for the company. That means they own HK$794m worth of shares in the HK$1.2b company. That’s quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public Ownership The general public, with a 33% stake in the company, will not easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Next Steps: While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

{"requested_url": "https://www.mvtimes.com/2019/01/02/take-notes/", "plain_text": "Bach, Beethoven, Stravinsky, and more will make an appearance at the West Tisbury library as channelled through David Rhoderick, pianist, organist, and musicologist. Rhoderick has created an esthetics of music course, meeting on Wednesdays beginning Jan. 9. Many people believe there’s a link in our brains between science, math, and music. In Rhoderick’s case, a Cambridge (England) educated physicist turned computer scientist, it’s certainly the case. Music fascinates him and he’s going to tell you why. As a teen, Rhoderick won an organ scholarship to Glasgow University, but chose Cambridge and science instead. Not too shabby. He does sometimes wonder, however, what course his life would have taken had he headed to the keyboard. He doesn’t voice regrets, just enthusiasm for the next phase. Piano was a constant for him from the age of 7, within a family of music lovers. At one point, Rhoderick declared he wanted to play the organ but was told he’d need to wait until his legs were long enough to reach the pedals. Happily, this happened. At Cambridge he sang with the Clare Chapel Choir, a bastion of luscious choral singing, built on hundreds of years of English musical tradition. Rhoderick spent his working life with IBM, traveling the world, managing a group involved in the understanding and uses of mainframes. Did you think they were outdated? Apparently many do. Rhoderick says, “We took our show on the road, meeting with CIO and IT officers, detailing how the major financial institutions use mainframes. I’m taking the skills I used as a ‘mainframe evangelist’ and applying them to my first love, music, and testing the waters at the West Tisbury library.”  Rhoderick did ease off music early in his career, but once he had children, he decided to lead by example, enjoying the kids and the keys. From 2012 to 2017, he was the music director of the First Congregational Church of West Tisbury. He’s even working on his master’s in music from the Open University, a UK distance-learning institution. Rhoderick is on the 16-year plan, hoping to complete his final project on politics in music by the year 2020. Do the math. There’s a famous quote, attributed to at least three of the greats — Stravinsky, Picasso, and Shaw — that claims “great artists don’t imitate, they steal.” Rhoderick, an active supporter of the Martha’s Vineyard Chamber Music Society, has stolen the idea of his new course, Classical Music is for You!, after taking note of some of the Island’s highly successful programs: Adult Community Dance Class with the Yard, led by Jesse Keller Jason, director of Island Programs and Education and co-producer at the Yard, and Sandra Whitworth, the Tisbury Senior Center’s activities director’s trips to the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The M.V. Chamber Music Society has a terrific artists-in-the-schools program, including classical music presentations, scholarships, and loan-out violins for young musicians. Rhoderick is interested in the the place music holds in our imagination, in the history of composers, the structure of the works, performance practices, the continuum of Western music, and the many ways music is used in other art forms.  “I recently attended a performance at the Gardner by the Handel and Haydn Society, when the ensemble, playing original instruments, performed all six Brandenburg Concertos. It was thrilling. A performance like that is something special, truly unforgettable,” Rhoderick said. Rhoderick mentioned two books as points of entry: New York Times chief music critic Anthony Tommisini’s “The Indispensable Composers,” and Oxford’s “The Psychology of Music: A Very Short Introduction”. Tommisini’s book began as a top 10 list of the best classical composers for the NY Times, with an invitation for readers to comment. They did. Vociferously. Tommisini expected as much, and the dialogue led to the creation of the book. Like Rhoderick’s class, it’s an upbeat take classical music, with novice friendly musical definitions, anecdotes on love lives, financial disasters, and contemporaneous criticism. Tommisini recently expanded the list from 10 to 17. Still no Mahler, no Puccini! Can you guess who did make the cut? And what will Rhoderick have to say about it all? Each hour and 15 minute session will focus on one composer, ending with a short piano performance. The class will go at least eight weeks, and Rhoderick plans to invite other musicians as guest instructors. Rhoderick’s skill, curiosity, and connection to music as a fan has given him the ability to talk with professionals and devotees on equal footing. But, as he says, “No experience necessary.” Classical Music is for YOU! will meet Wednesdays from 10:30 to 11:15 am at the West Tisbury library. The class is sponsored by the Martha’s Vineyard Chamber Music Society and the West Tisbury library. The first class is Jan. 9, and there’s no fee or registration necessary. Attend one class or all of them.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Take notes - The Martha's Vineyard Times", "tags": "", "categories": "Arts & Entertainment", "author": "Wendy Taucher", "sitename": "The Martha's Vineyard Times", "image_url": "https://www.mvtimes.com/mvt/uploads/2019/01/GEM_David-Rhoderick_02.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9596979022026062, "responded_url": "https://www.mvtimes.com/2019/01/02/take-notes/", "publisher": "mvtimes.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T21:39:55+00:00"}

The regular season is over and there are 12 teams remaining in the run to the Super Bowl.  And at the top of the AP Pro32 poll, the new year starts right where the previous one ended.  The New Orleans Saints, Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Bears, the top three seeds in the NFC, retained their top three spots in the final AP Pro32 poll of the season.  New Orleans received 11 of the 12 first-place votes for 382 points in balloting Wednesday by media members who regularly cover the NFL. New Orleans will open the playoffs at home in the divisional round on Sunday, Jan 13.  \"The Saints lost in Week 1 and Week 17, both at home,\" said Ira Kaufman of Fox 13 in Tampa, Florida. \"In between, Drew Brees and company established themselves as the team to beat in the Super Bowl chase.\"  New Orleans Saints receiver Michael Thomas makes a catch during an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers, Sunday, Dec. 30, 2018 in New Orleans. (Scott Clause/The Daily Advertiser via AP)  The Rams, who also finished 13-3 in the regular season, will start their postseason at the Coliseum on Saturday, Jan. 12.  The Bears will close wild-card weekend when they host the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles on Sunday.  The next six spots in the poll are all taken by the AFC's playoffs teams.  The Chiefs, who have the AFC's top seed, are No. 4. Kansas City, which received the remaining first-place vote - from John Czarnecki of Fox Sports - has won the AFC West for three consecutive seasons.  Patrick Mahomes, who finished with 5,097 yards and 50 TD passes, will try to get Kansas City its first home playoff win since the 1993 season.  \"MVP front-runner Patrick Mahomes finished a brilliant first season as a starter with 50 touchdown passes,\" said Newsday's Bob Glauber. \"With home-field advantage in the AFC playoffs, is a Super Bowl berth next?\"  The Los Angeles Chargers and New England Patriots finished in a tie at No. 5 in the poll.  The Patriots, who won the AFC East for the 10th straight season and 15th time in the past 16 seasons, are the No. 2 seed in the AFC. They are trying to reach their ninth Super Bowl in the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady era. They are also trying to become the first team since the 1990s Buffalo Bills to return to the Super Bowl after losing it the previous season, and the first since the 1992 Bills to make a third successive trip to the big game.  The Chargers, despite finishing with the same record as the Chiefs at 12-4, lost the tiebreaker and are the No. 5 seed in the AFC. They will head to Baltimore to face the AFC North champion Ravens on Sunday. The Ravens are No. 9 in the poll.  AFC South rivals Houston and Indianapolis are Nos. 7 and 8 in the poll. Those teams will open the postseason in Houston on Saturday when they meet for the third time after splitting their previous meetings.  \"Just wish they had another WR,\" Czarnecki said of the Texans. Houston's DeAndre Hopkins finished second in the NFL with 1,572 yards, but the depth took a hit when Demaryius Thomas was lost for the season with an Achilles tendon injury.  Seattle and Dallas, who meet Saturday night in Texas, are 10th and 11th in the poll. The Seahawks and Cowboys both finished 10-6. They met in Seattle in Week 3, when the Seahawks won 24-13.  The team that made the biggest climb from the first poll, which was released before the season started, was the Bears, who started out at No. 28 and finished at No. 3. And the team that had the biggest drop was the Jacksonville Jaguars, who began at No. 7 and ended up at No. 28.  The Arizona Cardinals, who finished with the worst record in the NFL at 3-13 and have the No. 1 pick in April's draft, were a unanimous choice for last place in the poll.  ___  More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL  Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jared Goff passes against the San Francisco 49ers during the first half in an NFL football game Sunday, Dec. 30, 2018, in Los Angeles.

You don’t have the tools or the time.  Have I got a recipe for you! It is a simple rolled carrot cake, filled with a lightly spiced, cream cheesy buttercream. Easy to slice and serve. Each bite offers a suitable ratio of cake and filling, which is especially welcome for a carrot cake.  Jelly roll-type cakes bake up thin and moist, on a single sheet pan – no stress about uneven layers or having the right size cake pans. This one takes 13 minutes in the oven. While the cake is still warm, you do need to peel away its parchment paper and roll it up gently; this helps to keep it from splitting when it’s time to roll it with its filling. If there happens to be a small tear or perhaps an indent from a wrinkle in the parchment underneath, no worries. A finish coat of confectioners’ sugar, dusted over the chilled roll, hides all.  Best of all, the flavor is carrot-forward, without nuts or raisins to interrupt the texture of the crumb. You don’t even need a mixer, but a food processor is recommended for breaking down the carrots into an even mince. Once the roll has been refrigerated to firm up, you have options:  Unwrap, dust it with the sugar, slice, then serve to a crowd.  Cut it in half, rewrap each half in plastic wrap and foil, then freeze for up to a month, for an on-call dessert.  Cut the chilled, sugared carrot cake roll into individual slices, wrap each one and refrigerate for up to 1 week, for grab-and-go breakfast and afternoon tea.  See the marzipan carrots in the accompanying photo? We used colored decorating gel, 3 ounces of marzipan (both on the supermarket aisle), tender cilantro stems and a paring knife. Dust off those Sculpey skills and have fun.  CARROT CAKE ROLL  Servings: 8 to 10 For the cake  4 large eggs, preferably at room temperature 1⁄2 cup pure cane sugar or granulated sugar 2 tablespoons sunflower or mild vegetable oil 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 3⁄4 cup flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1⁄2 teaspoon salt 1 1⁄2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1⁄2 teaspoon ground ginger 1⁄4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1⁄8 teaspoon ground cloves 2 cups finely grated/shredded carrots (from 3 large, peeled carrots or about 12 ounces baby-cut carrots) Confectioners’ sugar, for dusting For the filling  1 1⁄4 cups confectioners’ sugar, preferably sifted (see headnote) 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1⁄4 teaspoon ground ginger 1⁄4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg STEPS  For the cake: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease a large (15 by 10 inches) baking sheet or jelly roll pan with cooking oil spray, including the sides, and then line it with parchment paper.  Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until evenly yellow, then add the sugar, oil, vanilla extract, flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves, whisking to form a smooth, caramel-colored batter. Stir in the carrots until evenly distributed, then pour onto the baking sheet. Spread the batter in an even layer, making sure to reach all the corners. If you find any large bits of carrot, get rid of them; they may create holes or gaps in the cake.  Bake (middle rack) for 13 minutes; the surface will look moist and lightly browned at the edges. (This is a flat cake!) Transfer to a wide wire rack to cool for no more than a few minutes, then run a knife around to loosen the cake’s edges.  The next few steps are the only tricky bits of the recipe; do them in quick succession, while the cake is still warm: Slide the cake and its parchment onto the rack. Lay a clean dish towel over the cake. Clamp your hands onto the edges of the rack (through the towel) and carefully invert the cake so it is on the dish towel, parchment paper side up. Peel away and discard the paper. Then use the rack and towel to flip the cake right side up, so it’s laying flat directly on the dish towel.  While the cake is still warm, gently tuck one short end under and begin to roll the cake across, creating a cylinder. It doesn’t have to be tight or perfect; this will help “train” the cake to roll and help keep it from splitting once the filling is spread on it. Let the cake cool in its roll. Sometimes a wrinkle in the paper may cause an indented line in the cake; not to worry.  Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine the confectioners’ sugar, cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract and spices in the bowl of a stand mixer or handheld electric mixer; beat on low speed until the sugar is blended in, then increase the speed to medium-high and beat until smooth, creamy and somewhat firm – firmer than a buttercream frosting.  Unroll the cake onto a new piece of parchment paper (off the towel; same size as the laid-out cake). Dust it lightly with confectioners’ sugar; this will help the filling stay in place.  Use an offset spatula to spread the filling evenly, leaving a 1/2-inch margin on the long sides.  Reroll the cake, gently, again from the same short side you used before, trying to make a somewhat tight roll. Roll it back toward you with the paper. Wrap the roll in aluminum foil, twisting the ends shut. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until firm. At this point, it also can be frozen; see the headnote.  When ready to serve, unwrap the carrot cake roll and place on a platter. Dust it with confectioners’ sugar.  Trim the short ends to expose the spiral pattern inside (and snack on those trimmings). Clean your sharp knife after making each crosswise cut. Serve at a cool room temperature.

The facilities located in Manila, Davao and Cebu will strengthen the company’s existing portfolio in the country, and enable it to provide records and data management and destruction services to around 1,000 customers. Notably, Lane Archive Technologies, based in Manila, offers records and document management services and data destruction, to a wide range of customers throughout Philippines. Per management, the buyout adds scale and expands Iron Mountain’s local and regional business that is already well established in the country’s major business and commercial centers. Further, with fortified presence and enhanced services, the acquisition serves information management needs of the company’s international customers, with operations in Philippines. Moreover, expansion in Philippines is a strategic fit as the country is witnessing a shift toward digital transformation, along with growth in records and information management outsourcing. Hence, leveraging on this trend, Iron Mountain is on the lookout for buyout opportunities that will compliment the company’s expertise in the region. Also, this will enable the company to integrate its local and global customers in the regional business, thereby improving returns. While the real estate investment trust (REIT) has a strong portfolio in North America and Western Europe, the company is now focusing on expansion in emerging markets to drive its long-term performance. However, Iron Mountain has a highly-leveraged balance sheet. High debt may limit the company’s future expansion and worsen its risk profile. The rising interest rate scenario is also expected to negatively impact its profitability, moving ahead.

Nexves has unveiled plans to release its app, which is described by founder Chris Herd as the “Netflix of financial services”, at the end of the first quarter, after being awarded a £10,000 cash injection from Scottish Edge. The fintech’s offering works on the basis of Open Banking, which aims to give people better control of their money, with users able to log in with their existing bank details and access services designed to help them invest smartly and reduce spending, for instance by comparing available rates for their household bills. Nexves will also use the fresh five-figure investment to help fund a public campaign and redesign the platform’s user interface. The start-up, which is currently participating in accelerator programmes through Royal Bank of Scotland and Elevator, has previously received backing from investors including BrewDog’s James Watt. Herd said the introduction of Open Banking has provided a huge opportunity for change in fintech. He said: “Our goal is to take advantage of this by creating a platform for mass consumer benefit through radical transparency. “The first wave of challenger banks has amassed huge user numbers by doing little more than providing a more functional user interface.

S. Aderibigbe, has released his prophecies for the year 2019. Aderibigbe disclosed that God told him that the any candidate former President Olusegun Obasanjo supports would win the 2019 elections. In his prophecies for the year, which he released yesterday, the clergyman disclosed that some governors and senators would die in 2019. Aderibigbe said: “God said we should proclaim a 3- day fasting and prayer before January 21, 2019 to avert massive bloodshed in our land in the year 2019. “God said 2019 general elections will not be peaceful, as it will not favour the ruling party. “God said one mighty figure in Lagos will pass away in 2019 and this will shake the entire state. “God said there will be serious fire outbreak in Lagos in 2019 that will be worse than 2018 occurrence. “God said one mighty king in Yoruba land will pass away in year 2019. “God said there will be serious strike action by schools in Nigeria in 2019 most especially in the tertiary institutions. Labour will also embark on serious industrial action in 2019 because of betrayal from government. “Fuel pump price will crash in 2019. “Dollar will also fall massively in 2019. “God said we should warn female students to be very careful as many of them will be kidnapped for money rituals in 2019. “God said that Boko Haram will still wax stronger and many more communities will be attacked and they will claim more lives in 2019 but this will not come to the South West. “God said that the interest of the former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, will come to pass on the 2019 presidential election. “God said we should pray against sudden death on the Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom. “God said one Governor will die of road accident on his way to Lokoja together with his driver and orderly in 2019. “God said that some popular political parties in Nigeria will no more function in 2019. “God said we should pray for the incumbent Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, to avert sudden death. “God said we should pray seriously against massive killings of Nigerians in South Africa in 2019. “Two countries in Africa will fight over land in 2019 and this will be terrible.

{"requested_url": "https://this.kiji.is/453535633537844321", "plain_text": "Beirut (AFP) - Syria's Kurds have established an autonomous region during seven years of civil war, but the abrupt decision by their US ally to withdraw has thrown their political future into doubt.  Kurdish-led forces control a large swathe of the country's north and northeast, some of it seized from the Islamic State group at the cost of heavy losses with backing from the US-led coalition.  A US withdrawal could leave them exposed on two fronts, both to an attack by neighbouring Turkey and its Syrian proxies, and to a return of Damascus government institutions.  Will they lose land? Syria's Kurdish minority have largely stayed out of the civil war, instead forging autonomy in a large swathe of the north and northeast, including along the Turkish border.  The fight against IS has allowed the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces to expand that territory to include the Euphrates Valley city of Raqa, as well as key oil and gas fields in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor.  On December 19, President Donald Trump took many even among his own supporters by surprise with the announcement of a full US troop withdrawal from Syria.  That prompted the Kurds to seek a new alliance with the Damascus regime to protect them from a long-threatened attack by neighbouring Turkey.  Ankara views the Kurdish fighters of the SDF as \"terrorists\", in cahoots with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been fighting Turkish troops since 1984.  Although unlikely without prior agreements between regime ally Russia and rebel backer Turkey, analysts foresee a possible carving up of the northeast between the different sides.  \"There will be a division of territory between the SDF, the Turks, and the Syrian army,\" political geographer and Syria expert Fabrice Balanche predicted.  What does the regime want? Today, the regime holds almost two-thirds of Syria after victories against jihadists and other rebels, and has pledged to eventually return the northeast to government control.  Last week, Damascus deployed troops in the northern countryside to stem off any Turkish-led attack on the flashpoint SDF-held city of Manbij.  On Wednesday, the army said 400 Kurdish fighters had retreated from areas around the Arab-majority city. But an Arab contingent of the SDF remains in control, and US forces are also present as they have not yet withdrawn.  On Monday, pro-government newspaper Al-Watan cited an Arab diplomat in Moscow as saying the northern city would revert to \"full state supervision\".  The source also said Turkey, Russia and fellow regime ally Iran would discuss \"a return of state institutions\" to areas further east, beyond the Euphrates River, at a meeting expected at the start of the year.  Balanche said the regime would eventually resume full control of the main northeastern cities of Hasakeh and Qamishli.  It would also retake the Arab-majority city of Raqa, as well as the oil fields of Deir Ezzor.  \"The Syrian army will... rapidly seize the Omar oil fields -- two-thirds of Syrian production,\" Balanche said.  What does Turkey want? Turkey has led two previous incursions across the border, the most recent of which saw its Syrian proxies seize the northwestern enclave of Afrin from Kurdish forces last year.  But analyst Heiko Wimmen said Ankara would first have to seek consent from Moscow before any third offensive, especially to use its air force.  \"If it does happen however, Turkey will try to control the border strip,\" said Wimmen, of the Brussels-based think tank, the International Crisis Group.  \"What they are aiming for is a buffer zone along the border,\" he said, stressing that the mission would be fraught with difficulty.  \"It is not clear that they are immediately prepared to take over and control a large area with a partly hostile population,\" he said.  Balanche predicted Turkish troops and their allies would eventually push 20 to 40 kilometres (12 to 24 miles) into Syria.  What of Kurdish autonomy? After decades of marginalisation, since the civil war erupted in 2011 Syria's Kurds have set up their own institutions in areas they control.  After government forces pulled out of Kurdish-majority areas in 2012, the Kurds set up their own administrations and implemented longstanding demands such as Kurdish-medium education.  But as loyalist forces gained ground last year and Damascus rejected Kurdish self-rule, the Kurds entered talks with the regime to seek some form of decentralisation.  With the Kurds now set to see their US ally withdraw from Syria, Wimmen said the Kurds were \"certain to lose a lot\".  \"The question is whether the loss will be total or whether some of it can be salvaged... through a deal with the regime, guaranteed by Russia,\" he said.  But \"given the track record of the regime and its negotiation positions so far... there is little reason for optimism.\"", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "What next for Syria's Kurds? - AFP | This Kiji", "tags": "AFP,Syria,conflict,Kurds", "categories": "", "author": null, "sitename": "AFP", "image_url": "https://nordot-res.cloudinary.com/t_ogimage2/ch/images/453535620057629793/origin_1.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9765996336936951, "responded_url": "https://this.kiji.is/453535633537844321", "publisher": "this.kiji.is", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103113843-00071.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T12:59:21+00:00"}

Corey Miller, a sportscaster for WACH Fox who covers Clemson, joined me and Lee Shirvanian and, of course, was asked about his son’s status for the game. “He’s just working,” Corey Miller said of Christian. “He’s day to day. I can tell you they are doing everything they can to try and get him ready with treatment and rehab. They are playing a team he’s familiar with. We’re from the state of South Carolina. I cover Clemson. He was recruited by Clemson. As a matter of fact, Clemson was the first team to offer him. It means a lot to him to get on the field with his brothers and try to win another national championship.” Christian Miller sustained a hamstring injury early in the second half of the CFP semifinal win against Oklahoma. “He’s working hard,” Corey Miller said. \"He’s encouraged and has a good attitude just like he did when he had the biceps (injury).

Sarah Edwards tied the knot to husband Paul on Christmas Day, just 12 weeks after they matched on dating app Bumble.  In the words of This Morning host Eamonn Holmes \"Bumble led to fumbles\" and the couple met for the first time at Gatwick airport before flying out to wed in Las Vegas.  Sarah, 34, claims she revealed all about her BDSM past to Paul, 36, before her topless photos emerged.  She has been \"completely open\" about her private lift and had already shown Paul the kinky snap.  When Eamonn asked about the naughty pic, Paul said: \"I'd already seen the picture. I already knew her likes and dislikes. There wasn't anything we hid from each other. It wasn’t a surprise to me.\"  Sarah said: \"We’ve been completely open about literally everything.\"  While Paul added: \"We were every open and honest about everything in our lives, past, present, future, our aspirations.\"  Inspired by Married At First Sight, the pair made the impulsive decision to get married despite never meeting before.  The couple kissed for the first time during their actual wedding ceremony.  Ruth Langsford admitted she would have wanted to kiss them before, but Paul assured her he was a \"good kisser\".  On how they would strengthen their relationship, Sarah said: \"Trust. Having faith in each other. It's going to be difficult but any marriage is difficult.\"  With their relationship now a fortnight old, the couple have revealed they're already planning kids.  Paul has introduced his wife to one of his teenage daughters, who is thrilled.  Paul said: \"I think any relationship is a risk. You invest your emotions, heart, soul into a person. If you take that risk at the beginning you know you are fully invested.\"  *This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am  Do you have a story to sell?

The Civilian Office of Police Accountability released the footage shortly before a 60-day deadline imposed by the city in the wake of the Laquan McDonald shooting scandal. Police reports made public by COPA along with the video indicate the man pointed a gun at the officer shortly after 7 p.m. last Halloween. Police said a handgun with an extended magazine was recovered inside the apartment building in the 7900 block of South Ingleside Avenue in the city’s East Chatham neighborhood.  Derrell Johnson, 23, was taken to an area hospital for treatment and charged with multiple felonies, including being an armed habitual criminal, aggravated assault to a police officer and a misdemeanor charge of possessing a high-capacity magazine and metal-piercing bullets. Johnson, who was on parole for a 2015 felony drug conviction at the time of the shooting, is back in custody in state prison, records show. Police said he has a tattoo on his lower left arm showing a skull with the lettering “Cpdk,” a street term allegedly standing for “Chicago Police Department killer.” According to the body camera footage released by COPA, an officer entered through the rear of an apartment and spotted Johnson at the front door. The officer, carrying a flashlight and his service weapon, briefly chased Johnson as he fled down a stairwell in the building’s hallway. Police reports released by COPA identified the officer as Constantino Martinez.  Within seconds, the officer indicated that Johnson was carrying a gun. “Shots fired!” he shouted moments later after opening fire. “Let me see your f------ hands!” After the officer yelled at him to “get on the f------ ground!” Johnson sat on a landing against a wall and put his hands up. “Get up here!” the officer shouted, apparently to other police in the building. “You got the gun?”  The officer told Johnson to “give me your f------ hand” and placed him in handcuffs. “Get me an ambulance! Get me an ambulance!” he then shouted. Johnson, who reported he was shot in the back, turned on his side, leaving bloodstains on the wall behind him. By then, several other officers had arrived in the stairwell. “He’s shot in the back, shot in the back,” an officer said. “My partner has (the) gun.” The officer who shot him then told Johnson that an ambulance was on the way. “Take a deep breath, all right?” the officer said to Johnson. “Why didn’t you drop the gun?” an officer could be heard asking. A short time later, another officer yelled to all the others to shut off their body cameras. “Cameras off!” the officer shouted. “We’re done!” jgorner@chicagotribune.com Twitter @JeremyGorner", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Dramatic video of shooting by Chicago cop last Halloween released by authorities", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Jeremy Gorner", "sitename": "chicagotribune.com", "image_url": "https://www.trbimg.com/img-5c2d32d5/turbine/ct-met-chicago-police-shooting-video-20190102", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9791408181190491, "responded_url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-chicago-police-shooting-video-20190102-story.html", "publisher": "chicagotribune.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T22:12:52+00:00"}

Continue Reading Below GM hit a designated sales threshold – a cumulative 200,000 vehicles – which triggers a phase-out of the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing a person briefed on the matter. The automaker is said to have hit the sales figure in the fourth quarter, which suggests the credit will be halved – to $3,750 – around April. Following that timeline, the credit would fall further to $1,875 in October before being completely eliminated in April 2020. After GM announced plans to shutter U.S. factories, the Trump administration threatened to cut subsidies to the U.S. automaker – including those for electric vehicles. GM did not immediately return FOX Business’ request for comment. It was widely expected the automaker would hit 200,000 in sales by early 2019. Advertisement In a bid to boost profits, GM has narrowed its vehicle offerings, including a focus on its portfolio of electric models. It is scheduled to release two new electric cars in 2019, adding to a total of 20 by 2023. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla plunged on Wednesday after the electric automaker announced it was slashing the price of its vehicles by $2,000 to combat the phasing out of the same federal tax credit. On Jan. 1, customers looking to purchase a Tesla were only eligible to receive $3,750 in tax credits after Tesla reached the 200,000 sales milestone last year.

The controversy erupted after the national song was not sung on the first day of January at the state secretariat on Tuesday. The BJP questioned the “patriotism” of the Congress for discontinuing the 13-year-old practice. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath said the practice of singing Vande Mataram on the first working day of every month was being discontinued for the time being as the government decided to implement it in a new form. “We have not taken this decision under any agenda nor are we opposed to singing ‘Vande Mataram’. It is deeply rooted in our hearts and we have sung it from time-to-time. We will start it again but in a different form,” Nath said in a statement. But this did not satisfy the BJP. Amit Shah deflected the political row in the state to the national politics dragging Rahul Gandhi into the controversy. In a Facebook post, Amit Shah said if Rahul Gandhi approved of the decision of the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh to do away with the practice of singing of Vande Mataram. Calling Madhya Pradesh the “heart of Hindustan”, Amit Shah alleged that the decision of the Kamal Nath government was politics of “appeasement”. He said, “I want to ask Congress president Rahul Gandhi whether the insult to Vande Mataram is his decision? Rahul Gandhi should clarify his position to the nation on the unfortunate decision of the Congress government.” Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said he and all other BJP MLAs would sing Vande Mataram on the first day of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly session if the Congress-led state government does not restore the practice of singing it at the secretariat.

He was 76 years old. Einstein reportedly had been diagnosed with cancer shortly before his death. Before \"Curb,\" Einstein made a name for himself as not just an actor, but also a writer, winning his first Emmy in 1969 for Oustanding Writing Achievement in Comedy, Variety or Music for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.\" Einstein initially pursued a career in advertising but was discovered when Tom Smothers spotted him performing on a local access cable show as a favor for a pal. Einstein was 26 at the time, and reportedly said of the experience, “I go over and now I’m sitting and watching rehearsals and my mind is burning and all of sudden out of nowhere I want this, a bee has stung me in the back, and I want this.” After working with The Smothers Brothers, Einstein — older brother to fellow actor and writer Albert Brooks — created the character Super Dave Osborne, who appeared in various series from 1979 to 2009.

Of those five, only two departments have so far made any purchase through the portal.  The slow pace of registration – at a time when the Information Technology Department is trying to push the initiative – has irked the State government, which has sought an action-taken report from all departments. The idea of the portal is to completely automate the public procurement process nationally for better accountability.  So far, the two government departments from Tamil Nadu have made 4,037 transactions worth `70 crore. “We are taking efforts to ensure that all departments use the GeM portal for procurement processes,” said an IT department official. Sources also added that the issue of departments failing to register with the national procurement portal was raised at a high-level meeting of top officials.  GeM is used by the ministries and departments of Centre and State governments, public sector undertakings, autonomous institutions and local bodies. In the last two years, the portal recorded 8 lakh transactions worth `12,239 crore across India.  GeM has nearly 27.9 thousand buyer organisations registered and about 1.43 lakh sellers and service providers offering more than 4.86 lakh products and services. The portal contributes about 20-25 per cent of the overall savings for the Centre.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Only two State departments using GeM; government seeks report", "tags": "Government e-Marketplace, Information Technology Department", "categories": "Chennai", "author": "C Shivakumar", "sitename": "The New Indian Express", "image_url": "http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/logo/nie_logo_600X390.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9555568695068359, "responded_url": "http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jan/02/only-two-state-depts-using-gem-govt-seeks-report-1919469.html", "publisher": "newindianexpress.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T22:21:26+00:00"}

It’s 1990 and we are driving our Deuce roadster to Columbus, Ohio for the 21st Annual NSRA Street Rod Nationals. This would be the fifth time the Nats was held in Columbus. Columbus proved to be a favorite location for street rodders from across the country. The 1990 version of the Columbus Nats would prove to be largest of the seven Nationals held at the site with 12,668 street rods filling the Ohio State Fairgrounds to overflowing. This event simply felt huge. The trends seemed to include every type and style of hot rod from traditional fenderless hot rods to postwar cars. But we do remember fat fendered sedans seemed to be more abundant and then there were graphics, lots of graphics from adding small flag graphics to traditional pinstriping to blazing two-tones and tri-colors. There were good graphics and some not-so-good graphics as many street rodder learned it was more difficult than it looks to produce a good design. The Chevrolet “heartbeat graphics” seemed to be the inspiration point for many of them, but in the end, good or bad, graphics would, for the most part, simply go out of style. Along with the graphic trend (dare we say fad?) was the smooth look. Stainless and chrome trim was being removed from the flanks of fat fendered cars to add to the already bulbous appearance. Of course this contributed heavily to the monochromatic look too, with painted bumpers becoming common. Once again, often trim removal worked, other times it simply made the car look like something was missing. The dress code continued the street rod theme of mostly white T-shirts and mesh-back, foam front caps were common too. Shorts were shorter and some rodders insisted on not wearing a shirt regardless of the degree of fitness on display, let’s just say the Nats fairgrounds were never confused with the Olympic Village. The weather at Columbus was a mixed bag, with rain, clouds, and sun over the four days. But in the end it was another great NSRA Street Rod Nationals, and Columbus always seemed to have a good energy, with plenty of evening cruising.  I have discovered 90 black and white photos from the 1989 Nationals. If you were there, enjoy looking back on the event and who knows, you or your car may be in one of the photos. If you didn’t attend, scroll through the photos for a quick look at another chapter in the golden age of street rodding. A final note, all this nostalgia has us wondering, since 2019 is the 50th NSRA Street Rod Nationals, how many of the folks and cars in these photos will be in attendance in Louisville, Kentucky this August? This year should be a great 50th reunion. Enjoy.

A West Sussex County Council spokesman said local county councillor Hilary Flynn and the parish council identified the Summerley Lane/Felpham Way junction as ‘needing improvement’. “Local consultation led to the new mini roundabout being included in an improvement scheme, which is aimed at reducing the impact of increased traffic from new developments in the area,” it added. “It will make it easier for traffic movements in and out of Summerley Lane, improve safety for those making a right turn out of the junction and help reduce traffic speeds in this part of Felpham Way. “The introduction of the mini roundabout also means the controlled pedestrian crossing will need to be moved - to outside the petrol station. The existing pedestrian refuge islands will be enlarged to provide safer places to cross the road.” West Sussex Highways apologised for any inconvenience and delays that will be caused during the works. A spokesman added: “Please be assured we will do all we can to try to limit this as much as possible by manually controlling the temporary traffic lights during peak periods.” The work is scheduled to start on January 21 and should take about six weeks, subject to factors such as severe weather, according to the county council. The county council spokesman added: “Three-way, temporary traffic lights will be in operation for the majority of the works and will include a temporary pedestrian crossing facility. “The project is being funded from developer contributions and will cost about £140k.”", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Mini roundabout to be built in Felpham", "tags": "", "categories": "News", "author": "Sam Morton", "sitename": "Chichester Observer", "image_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/http://editorial.jpress.co.uk/mastheads/JPOS-masthead-share-img.png", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.964224636554718, "responded_url": "https://www.chichester.co.uk/news/mini-roundabout-to-be-built-in-felpham-1-8757081", "publisher": "chichester.co.uk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103113843-00071.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T13:07:32+00:00"}

Jason O'Halloran, 29, was shopping with his wife in Morrisons in Bath for some breakfast items on December 31 after leaving work.  After leaving the shop, it wasn't until the couple arrived home that they realised something was wrong with one of their purchases.  Jason said: \"By the time we got home my wife noticed that it was three days out-of-date.  \"I phoned up the store and spoke to the manager. He told me to stick it in the fridge and the next time I come in, he'll give me the £2 back.  \"He said it doesn't matter when I bring them back but he can put the money back on my card.  \"I tried seeing if he would offer anything else. I thought shops face a hefty fine for selling out-of-date items.  \"Absolutely disgusting - I phoned the store and all they offered was £2 back.\"  Jason knows how busy stores get around Christmas but was still frustrated at the service.  He works at the McColls shop in Bathwick.  He said: \"I work in a shop and know what it is like at this time of year but you still don't expect it.\"  Although the pair didn't eat the bacon, Jason explained that it could have been much worse.  He said that his wife Stephanie, 28, is six months pregnant and wouldn't like to think about what would happen if she ate that and became ill.  A Morrisons spokeswoman said: \"We're sorry that we sold an item that had just gone out of date. We have offered a full refund.\"  Want more news?

Fugazi are noted for their unique sound, blending of elements of dub/reggae with high energy rock and punk/hardcore-styled guitars, as well as for their business practices and contempt towards the music industry. The band, and others from the punk and hardcore scene leading up to the early 1990s, were among the early adopters of what grew to be known as the DIY ethic. Fugazi have performed numerous worldwide tours, produced six studio albums, a film and a comprehensive live series, gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world.

Pulisic, 20, becomes the third most expensive signing in Chelsea’s history, following goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and Alvaro Morata. The skilful winger had just 18 months left on his contract at Borussia Dortmund, who were refusing to let him go until the end of the campaign. Chelsea, though, wanted to get a deal agreed now to avoid competition for his signature and were prepared to pay a higher sum to do it. Following the signing, Pulisic said: “It’s a privilege to sign for a legendary club and I look forward to working hard towards being a contributor to their team of world-class players. Looking forward to working with Maurizio Sarri and his technical team.” Pulisic’s arrival increases speculation over the future of Hazard and Hudson-Odoi in particular because they have refused to sign deals and Sarri admitted at the weekend he wanted the club to buy a winger. Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia said: “We are delighted to have signed one of Europe’s most sought-after young players. “Christian has shown his quality during a fantastic spell in Germany and, at just 20, he has the potential to become an important Chelsea player for many years to come.” The deal comes just two days after Chelsea announced they had made a record £62m profit for the year ending June 30, 2018. Pulisic’s arrival will help the Blues grow a bigger fanbase in America, where they have toured on several occasions in pre-season for more than a decade. With Chelsea also enjoying a £60m-a-year shirt contract deal with American sportswear firm Nike, there is great potential for the club to benefit even more commercially.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "American Star, Christian Pulisic, Joins Chelsea for £58m - Olisa.tv", "tags": "Chelsea;Christian Pulisic", "categories": "Sports", "author": "Emmanuel", "sitename": "Olisa.tv", "image_url": "https://www.olisa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Christian-Pulisic.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.980678915977478, "responded_url": "https://www.olisa.tv/american-star-christian-pulisic-joins-chelsea-for-58m/", "publisher": "olisa.tv", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102150606-00065.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T16:20:21+00:00"}

A case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, read with the domestic violence Act, has been opened against the nanny.  The incident happened on Friday morning in Windhoek North when the boy’s mother asked the nanny to bath him.  \r\nThe mother was bathing at the time of the incident. According to City Police spokesperson, Fabian Amukwelele, the nanny poured hot water in the bath tub, and the child allegedly jumped in the bath and he got burnt.  “But what is interesting is the areas were the child burnt. If you look [at] where the child burnt, it’s in the stomach, face, and shoulders. If the child really jumped into the bath tub, he could have burnt on the feet or hands; and the nanny was asked since she removed the child from the hot water, ‘didn’t she burn?’ But she replied [that] she pulled the child out on the fingers,” remarked Amukwelele, who added that the nanny showed no sign of remorse. \r\nAmukwelele added the boy is in a lot of pain, according to the mother. According to Khomas Regional Crime Investigation Coordinator, Deputy Commissioner Abner Agas, the allegation is that the nanny poured hot water on the victim, resulting on the boy to burn severely on the body. Agas said the suspect, name withheld, was arrested, but later released due to the lack of evidence linking her to the incident.  “She (nanny) claims the boy fell in the bath that was filled with hot water. The police investigation into the matter continues,” stated Agas.  Khomas Regional Commander, Commissioner Sylvanus Nghishidimbwa, confirmed that a case is opened, but the nanny won’t appear in court, as there is insufficient evidence, and it won’t make sense for her to appear for the sake of appearing in court. Nghishidimbwa said the nanny gave her side of the story.   \r\n  Selma Ikela 2018-12-03 08:58:44 30 days ago", "published_date": "2018-12-03", "title": "Nanny severely scalds boy", "tags": "", "categories": "Front Page News", "author": "Selma Ikela", "sitename": "New Era Live", "image_url": "https://neweralive.na/uploads/2018/11/burnt%201(1).jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9682605266571045, "responded_url": "https://neweralive.na/posts/nanny-severely-scalds-boy", "publisher": "neweralive.na", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102122114-00064.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T14:06:36+00:00"}

Susan Flores, Otero County commissioner, remembers that first county commission meeting when she realized she didn’t have a clue what the position entailed. “Two weeks later I went to the Better Informed Public Officials conference for newly elected officials where I took my first New Mexico EDGE class and realized there is a whole lot more to being a commissioner than I had thought,” Flores said of the conference she attended eight years ago. “You are never a private citizen once you take the oath of office. You have to be sure you are always acting as an elected official.” The Better Informed Public Officials conference is hosted by the New Mexico Counties, formally known as New Mexico Association of Counties, every even year after the general election. At the recent conference 180 newly elected and re-elected public officials were informed of the New Mexico laws that govern county government. NM EDGE provided training to commissioners, assessors and probate judges. NM EDGE, which stands for Education Designed to Generate Excellence in the Public Sector, is an umbrella organization operated by New Mexico State University’s Cooperative Extension Service. It provides continuing education certification programs for elected officials and employees of counties, municipal entities and state agencies. Rebecca Long, Lea County commissioner for four years, finds it interesting to watch newly elected officials while they go through the BIPO class on roles and responsibilities of a commissioner. “Their eyes get wide as they hear what is expected of them,” Long said. “Being an elected official comes with a great responsibility that you must take seriously.” The BIPO class also opens the elected official’s eyes to see other courses NM EDGE provides that help the county run professionally. “Through the initial classes I learned that there are more classes offered on subjects such as ethics and professionalism – these are huge subjects to take, because you have to be professional in everything you do,” Flores said. Since that first BIPO conference, Flores has earned NM EDGE designations of certified county commissioner and certified public official and has taken certified advocate for public ethics classes. Flores is among 17 Otero County elected officials and employees who have earned either single or multiple certifications of public official, public supervisor, treasury official, assessment officer, purchasing professional and professional risk manager. Lea County has 21 elected officials and employees who have earned the first tier of the nationally accredited certified public manager program with certified public official designation. One has earned the second tier – certified public supervisor. One has completed the final tier – certified public manager. Public officials from every New Mexico county have participated in, and graduated from, the NM EDGE program. Santa Fe County has the largest number of graduates with 52 receiving one or more designations. “Having our elected officials and employees take these classes has had a big impact on the county government,” Flores said. “It has helped us to have a professionally run county because we understand the laws and rules.” “When the county officials are knowledgeable about the laws, they can answer the constituents’ questions immediately,” Long said. “This gives our constituents confidence in their county government.”", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "New Mexico Edge helps county commissioners get started", "tags": "", "categories": "news", "author": "Jane Moorman; Jmoorman Edu", "sitename": "Deming Headlight", "image_url": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/30/PNM1/d912ee4a-888d-4ebf-977e-20d0e088129e-NMSU.jpg?crop=3999,2277,x0,y163&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9754161238670349, "responded_url": "https://www.demingheadlight.com/story/news/2019/01/02/new-mexico-edge-helps-county-commissioners-get-started/2445891002/?from=new-cookie", "publisher": "demingheadlight.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102235655-00068.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T01:33:35+00:00"}

Meeker intends to raise $1.25 billion for Bond’s debut growth fund on a $1.5 billion hard cap. Meeker will have no trouble pooling capital, given her success at Kleiner Perkins, where she was a partner for eight years, backing companies such as Airbnb, Houzz, Slack and Peloton. In September, Kleiner Perkins confirmed it was spinning out its growth team to become an independent firm, with Meeker at the helm. Kleiner Perkins general partners Mood Rowghani and Noah Knauf joined Meeker in the new effort, as well as Juliet de Baubigny, a partner focused on team building.  “The environment for venture has evolved — with larger checks being written for seed and A rounds and more support from partners required to build companies — demanding a high degree of specialization and extreme focus to excel,” a spokesperson for Kleiner Perkins said in a statement provided to TechCrunch in September. “The changes in both areas have led to less overlap between venture and growth and creating two separate firms with different people and operations now makes sense.”  We’ve reached out to Meeker for comment.  Meeker joined Kleiner Perkins in 2010 after two decades as a managing director at Morgan Stanley. A well-established Wall Street tech analyst, she quickly rose in the Silicon Valley ranks and became one of few women to earn a GP title at Kleiner Perkins in an industry where women have traditionally been shut out from the highest roles.

{"requested_url": "https://www.tennessean.com/story/money/homes/2019/01/02/5-tips-getting-your-home-organized-new-year/2434719002/", "plain_text": "What's it like to be beautifying the closets of A-List celebs Larry McCormack, lmccormack@tennessean.com Decorating for the holidays can make your home look like a beautiful story book, but once the presents — and the extended family — are gone, your home can look a bit more like a nightmare than a fairy tale. But the new year brings a perfect time to step back, take a deep breath and resolve to get your home organized and clutter-free. In fact, January is designated as GO Month (or Get Organized month) by the National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals. GO Month is an initiative that focuses on the benefits of organization and how getting organized empowers people to regain control over their lives. We spoke to Hendersonville-based NAPO home organization professional Shanna Perino and compiled the top five ways to rid your home of unwanted clutter so you can begin the new year with a cleaner, more organized home. 1. Declutter. Coming off the heels of an expensive time of year, between holiday shopping, cooking, traveling and entertaining, often the budget for this year (and part of next) has been spent. So, focus your efforts now on getting rid of stuff instead of buying anything or spending money. Decluttering doesn’t cost a dime and is quite possibly the No. 1 way to establish a bit of organization in your home. 2. Start small. Not sure where in the world to start your decluttering efforts? Think small.Pick one shelf or one drawer. Empty it completely, wipe it down to remove all dust and debris. Then gradually and very carefully replace only necessary items. “Give yourself room to grow,” Perino said. “ ... Just because you have an empty drawer doesn’t mean you have to find something to put there.” Everything else goes somewhere else, and in many cases, it needs to be either the garbage or a donation pile. Then stand back and enjoy your one tiny victory. Let your one organized shelf or drawer inspire you to keep going. 3. One room at a time. After you’ve cleaned off a shelf or two, next tackle a room, such as a bathroom or laundry room. Don’t begin by attempting to tackle the bonus room that your kids have been collectively destroying with their toys/games/gadgets/goodies for years. “The biggest motivating factor I have found is to get enough work done to see visible results of your work,” Perino added. “If you never see any visible results, people get discouraged and stop. That’s what you want to avoid.” Once you have a super clean and tidy laundry room, for example, move to the next room. Maybe still not the bonus room. Save that for when you have some progress under your belt that can fuel your motivation to maintain the organization train. Perino also recommends getting your kids involved in the sorting and purging process. “Children as young as 5 are capable of making decisions about what to keep and what to get rid of,” she said. “They need to be involved and start learning that skill early or they won’t learn it. If they got new toys for Christmas, help them understand they have to get rid of some old ones to make room for new ones. Kids love when their things are donated instead of being thrown away.” 4. Create a system for keeping it clean. After you have made some organization progress throughout your house, and just as you begin to sit back and enjoy your tidy home, unfortunately, real life is about to set back in. School is going to start, work will get hectic again and all of your hard work is at risk of returning to its former glory in the form of stacks of mail, socks under the couch and dishes piled up in the sink. Perino said this is where the organization and clutter maintenance can get challenging. “It’s a loaded topic because you don’t know whether you are dealing with chronic disorganization issues or folks with ADHD who struggle with maintenance issues and lack of focus. This can be a time to bring in a professional organizer to help design a maintenance system.” She added that many people who try to maintain organization do the process backwards, by buying containers first. “A bunch of containers isn’t what makes up an organizing system. It’s made up of a process of how to do things and then finding containers that the items are housed in,” Perino said. “Buying containers is actually the last step in the process. Sorting and purging come first. Group like items together, figure out where you want those to live and then you go get the containers. That’s a huge mistake a lot of people make.” 5. Share/donate what you no longer need. Just because you have realized you have five of the same shirt doesn’t mean that four of them should go in the trash. Most anything can be donated or, at the very least, recycled. Some worthy charities that take donations include Goodwill and the Salvation Army, and Perino recommends Habitat for Humanity ReStore for tools, hardware and building supplies. “I always like to find places that will take weird odds and ends,” she said.Monthaven Arts & Cultural Center in Hendersonville, for example, will take items like straws, string, glue sticks, silk flowers, half-used trays of watercolor paint and basically anything they can use for children’s arts and crafts. “Another great place to check with is your local community theater,” Perino said. “They will use old paint for their scenery, and costuming departments can use old fabric to make costumes.” More organizing advice: 3 home organization tips from The Home Edit More home decor: Franklin window treatment designer shares her best pro hacks", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "New Year’s resolution: declutter, organize, purge, donate", "tags": "", "categories": "money", "author": "Melonee Hurt; Special; USA TODAY NETWORK", "sitename": "Nashville Tennessean", "image_url": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/28/PNAS/a4cf5a66-52b7-40a4-8cc2-714ac63f1080-Decluttering.jpg?crop=2120,1188,x0,y83&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9610350728034973, "responded_url": "https://www.tennessean.com/story/money/homes/2019/01/02/5-tips-getting-your-home-organized-new-year/2434719002/", "publisher": "tennessean.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102174131-00066.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T19:23:58+00:00"}

According to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association or NATCA, air traffic controllers are not only understaffed but also working without pay. The FAA's ATC training center is closed during the shutdown while newly trained controllers have been put on furlough, limiting an already depleted staff. According to the union, this will lead to increased flight delays. As the US government shutdown drags on into another week, its effects are being felt across the nation. America's air transport system is certainly not immune from its effects. Stuck in the middle of the shutdown is America's beleaguered air traffic controllers.

With the government shut down, the country's air traffic control centers are not only understaffed but also currently working without pay, NATCA, the union that represents roughly 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers, and aviation professionals, said in a statement. \"This staffing crisis is negatively affecting the National Airspace System, and the shutdown almost certainly will make a bad situation worse,\" Paul Rinaldi NATCA's president said in the same statement. \"Even before the shutdown, controllers have needed to work longer and harder to make up for the staffing shortfall.\" The Federal Aviation Administration has temporarily closed its ATC training center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma as a result of the shutdown while newly trained controllers have been put on furlough. The result of all of this, according to Rinaldi, is increased flight delays for the traveling public. \"If the staffing shortage gets worse, we will see reduced capacity in the National Airspace System, meaning more flight delays,\" he said. \"A lack of adequate staffing also hurts the FAA's ability to develop new technology and modernize the system, and controllers also don't get the amount of time they need for training.\" The US federal government shut down on December 21, 2018, after the Congress failed to pass a new spending bill due to disagreement over the Trump Administration's demand for $5 billion in border wall funding.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "The government shutdown could spur more flight delays making travel a nightmare, air traffic controllers claim", "tags": "", "categories": "Transportation, Travel, Life, Politics", "author": "Benjamin Zhang", "sitename": "Business Insider", "image_url": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c2ceaaed4beaf10ad72b01a-2732-1366.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9656590819358826, "responded_url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-flight-delays-staffing-crisis-2019-1", "publisher": "businessinsider.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102174131-00066.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T19:25:04+00:00"}

Coach Steve Kerr has made it clear that Boogie would be one-and-done in Golden State, and his Warriors teammates knew this was the presumed agreement when Cousins joined the back-to-back NBA champions last summer. But perhaps not so fast? Marc Stein of the New York Times says a \"wise insider\" believes Cousins would be willing to stay in Golden State for another season in hopes of rebuilding his value after suffering a torn Achilles almost one year ago. Given the Warriors currently have Cousins signed to a one-year, $5.3 million contract, the NBA's collective bargaining agreement states that the Dubs can only offer Cousins a 20 percent raise -- up to $6.4 million -- for the 2019-2020 season. If Boogie looks anything like the superstar who dominated last season with the New Orleans Pelicans -- remember, he averaged an astounding 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game -- he'll command much more than that on the open market this summer. If Cousins struggles this season, on the other hand, the Warriors seemingly would want to allocate their money elsewhere next season. However, Stein implies there is a middle ground where Cousins is productive enough for the Warriors to want him back but still not quite good enough to command the maximum contract he'd get when healthy. There still are a lot of factors at play that will dictate Cousins' future with the team, most importantly the free agency decisions of teammates Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson.

{"requested_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2019/01/03/apples-shock-earnings-warning-raises-the-specter-of-ge-like-performance/", "plain_text": "Apple is a handset company. I have written that in my prior Forbes columns on the Cupertino giant, and that is by no means to denigrate the folks who work in Apple’s Services, Wearables, Mac or iPad product units. Apple's shocking press release last night underscored the company's need for a constant stream of upgrades to those handsets to maintain earnings growth.  Was Apple's announcement really shocking? Yes. According to Bespoke Research it was the first time since June 2002 that Apple had issued a press release to report downside guidance to an upcoming quarterly period. So, it had been more than 16 years since Apple felt the need to warn the Street of a \"miss.\" Given the magnitude of the miss and the delay until Apple's actual earnings report, January 29th, this was an example of corporate communications best practice from a well-run company.  Of course, being quick with bad news does not absolve management from presiding over the bad news. Apple CEO Tim Cook's repeated references in last night's press release to growing Apple's “installed base” bore an eerie resemblance to several such proclamations from former General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt.  The sizzle is in the steak. That is just as true for smartphones as it is for gas turbines. Selling the device is where the margin lies, especially since Apple uses so little of its own capital to actually produce an iPhone. Hon Hai’s Foxconn division does the final assembly of the iPhone in China, and other suppliers do all the componentry heavy-lifting. Apple's capital-light model produced some extraordinary returns on capital in the 2014-2017 time period, as I first noted in this Forbes article.    But demand has to be pulled, not pushed, and Cook noted a slowing smartphone upgrade cycle in last night’s “confessional” press release. It is the secular trend that will, in my opinion, hang over Apple's shares through 2019. Consumers are holding on to their handsets longer, and the iPhone is still a very expensive product for consumers in Greater China--a geography that Cook noted represented \"more than 100%” of the delta in the year on year revenue decline.  So, Apple is not quite GE just yet, and I don’t think it ever will be. The problem with the evolution from a higher return-on-capital manufacturing business model to a slower-payback recurring revenue model is that Street analysts--and I was one for 11 years--just never quite figure out how to model the shifting business mix.  While Cook did note his belief that Apple would still report “a record” figure for EPS in the December quarter, that figure will include a denominator that is 7.6% lower owing to Apple’s aggressive share repurchases. Apple's press release noted a share base of 4.77 billion for the December 2018 quarter versus the 5.16 billion actual figure for the December 2017 quarter. So, while I derive a $4.15 EPS estimate from Apple's new, lower guidance, that growth versus the December 2017 quarterly figure of $3.89 is entirely due to a lower share base.  With revenue forecast to decline 4.8% and my calculator showing a figure of $23.7 billion for pretax income based on Apple’s new guidance, that would represent a 12% decline in Apple’s core profitability on a year-on-year basis. Margins shrink when fewer units are moved through the same infrastructure, and while Apple will no longer report quarter iPhone unit shipments, it is clear from the tone of the release that the December 2018 quarter's volume was well below the 77.3 million units Apple shipped in the same quarter last year.  Declining unit sales and margin compression imply significant revisions to Apple's consensus EPS forecasts. Currently those figures are $13.18 for the September 2019 fiscal year and $14.70 for the 2020 fiscal year.  I believe most Street analysts will lower their EPS estimates for Apple this morning, but generally the earnings estimate revision cycle lasts quarters, not days or weeks. That's what will make it difficult to \"find a bottom” in Apple shares. I am sure many talking heads will throw out randomly-generated suggested P/E ratios for Apple--10 times, 12 times, etc.--in the financial media today, but until that earnings component (the denominator in the P/E ratio) solidifies, the stock won't either.  So, I won't be buying Apple at what will likely be a new 52-week low at the opening of trading this morning. Just as they did for GE, Apple's prospects looked much, much rosier 52 weeks ago than they do today. A new, darker outlook for the iPhone--and the global smartphone handset market in general--makes Apple's future profits much more difficult to divine. I'll let others in the market fish for a bottom and keep my clients' money elsewhere.

{"requested_url": "https://www.news.lk/news/political-current-affairs/item/23609-sri-lanka-fined-for-slow-over-rate", "plain_text": "Sri Lanka captains have repeatedly fallen afoul of over rates over the last few years, with Upul Tharanga, Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal all having suffered fines and demerit points.New Zealand 371/7 (Guptill 138, Williamson 76, Taylor 54, Neesham 47*) beat Sri Lanka 326 (Dickwella 76, Kusal Perera 102, Neesham 3-38) by 45 runs Martin Guptill smote a 14th career ton, Kane Williamson cruised to 76 off 74, and James Neesham clubbed 47 not out off 13 - hitting five sixes in an over - to launch New Zealand to a monstrous total, which despite a valiant Kusal Perera hundred, Sri Lanka fell short of by 45 runs.  Thanks to the start provided by Niroshan Dickwella, who made 76 off 50, and Danushka Gunathilaka, who joined him in a 119-run opening stand, Sri Lanka had the foundation to pull off an epic chase. Apart from Kusal Perera, however, no other batsmen responded. All four batsmen from Nos. 4-6 fell for less than 20, and struck at less than run-a-ball. In the end, too much was left to Kusal Perera, who despite an incredible hand, was battling an asking rate of over 15 when he got out in the 46th over. With him went all realistic chances of a successful chase, though hopes had been dwindling well before that.  Although Guptill made by far the game's biggest score, hitting 138 off 139 balls, it was Neesham - playing for New Zealand for the first time in over a year - who made the more impactful contributions. Having arrived late in the innings with the bat, he tonked Thisara Perera in the arc between the sightscreen and midwicket five times in one over - the bowler so emphatically rattled by Neesham's hitting that he even bowled a waist-high full-toss halfway through. With 33 runs having been scored off the first five balls of his over, Thisara was at risk of bowling the most expensive ODI over ever. But the last ball, a low full toss, was only struck to long-on by Neesham.  He did hit another six to finish the innings though, and then would come back and strike with the ball. He claimed the vital wicket of Dickwella, moving a wide length ball back off the seam slightly to draw an inside edge - the ball then ricocheting back into the stumps. He had earlier had Gunathilaka caught down the legside, and would later bounce Dinesh Chandimal out as well. In a game in which no other frontline bowler went at less than five an over, Neesham took three wickets and maintained an economy rate of 4.75 across his eight overs. Sri Lanka have been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate Almost as good was legspinner Ish Sodhi, who took 2 for 53 from his 10 overs, and was instrumental in sucking the momentum out of the Sri Lanka innings, just as they were looking to accelerate into the death overs. This, despite struggling for control of his legbreak in the early overs, and battling a leg injury of some description, for which he spent some time off the field. Jimmy Neesham launches one over cow corner Getty Images Earlier, both Guptill and Williamson's innings had been smooth from the outset, and it was their 163-run second-wicket stand that formed the spine of New Zealand's innings. The boundaries came rapidly for Guptill through the Powerplay, and he was particularly severe when the Sri Lanka bowlers pitched wide, which they did too often. He practically skated through the middle overs, happily working Sri Lanka's spinners into the outfield on a surface that was offering little turn. Whenever they offered him the chance to free his arms, he did so gleefully. There was an especially memorable six over extra cover off the legspin of Seekkuge Prasanna to bring up his fifty, then a swept six off Lakshan Sandakan a few overs later. As Guptill and Williamson's scores swelled, the Sri Lanka spinners appeared more and more toothless. Neither created any clear-cut wicket chances. Williamson played another one of his effortless innings, scoring heavily behind square on the offside to begin with, before runs began to come for him right around the ground. He used his feet to the spinners, and had even less trouble turning the strike over than his partner. He had looked good for a century until Pradeep bowled an off-cutter that Williamson was slightly late on - the ball bouncing back on to the stumps. He made 76 off 74 balls.  After Sri Lanka had been set their mammoth target, Dickwellla began to attack it in characteristic fashion, getting down on one knee to scoop the quicks over his head; slinking around the crease to make room to hit through the offside. He led the charge in the Powerplay, at the end of which Sri Lanka were 70 for no loss.  For Kusal Perera, there were early signs he was in excellent touch. He crashed his sixth ball - a short one from Neesham - to the deep square leg boundary, and clubbed four more fours from his next 15 balls. On errors of length, he was brutal, flicking overpitched deliveries over midwicket, and slamming the short, misdirected ones past square leg.  New Zealand were careful not to feed his punishing cut, though, which meant that he only occasionally scored through the offside. He raised his fourth - and perhaps best - ODI hundred by drilling Matt Henry through the covers, but by the end of his innings had scored over 75% of his runs to leg.  In fact, it was a ball way outside off stump - one that he perhaps should have cracked past cover point - that was his undoing. Batting on 102 off 85 balls, he reached out to hit an angled delivery from Boult, and wound up only sending a top edge high into the gloves of debutant Tim Seifert, who had run towards point to complete the catch.  Sri Lanka may be content with the fight they showed with the bat, but familiar woes have led to another ODI loss. Perhaps chief among those is lack of penetration through the middle overs. Neither Sandakan nor Prasanna could claim a wicket, allowing that giant Guptill-Williamson stand to flourish. New Zealand meanwhile, kept finding wickets through the middle overs, and ultimately claimed a comfortable victory.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Sri Lanka fined for slow over-rate", "tags": "Sri Lankan news, Sri Lanka news, news in sri lanka, Cricket, local authority election, Sri Lankan Elections, Local Government Election, lanka news, lankan news, news.lk, Department of Government Information, Information Department", "categories": "", "author": null, "sitename": "news.lk", "image_url": "/media/k2/items/cache/c3817dfc52d5a6d16265784f0cc19fc4_M.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9852254986763, "responded_url": "https://www.news.lk/news/political-current-affairs/item/23609-sri-lanka-fined-for-slow-over-rate", "publisher": "news.lk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103113843-00071.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T13:29:06+00:00"}

{"requested_url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-apos-favorite-recession-indicator-182346988.html", "plain_text": "(Bloomberg) -- Traders return to their desks in the new year with a familiar warning signal flashing even more strongly than before -- the Treasury yield curve got even flatter, feeding the market’s worst suspicions about the U.S. economy. Market watchers noted a dramatic compression in what is arguably the most reliable indicator of recession -- the gap between the 3-month and 10-year Treasury yields. This spread hit a post-crisis low of just 18.6 basis points in early New York trading Wednesday, barely half the intraday peak it reached on Dec. 31. The gap has since pulled back toward its opening level for the day of around 24 basis points, but the narrowing trend is hard to ignore as U.S. economic data deteriorate and traders start pricing in the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut in 2020. Interest-rate strategists at BMO Capital Markets point out that the slide in this indicator just made Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s job “that much harder.” While central bank officials have warned against over-interpreting flattening of the widely watched 2-year to 10-year curve, BMO points to “a great deal of academic research” around the curve from 3 months to 10 years, and “it is generally accepted as being a better recession predictor.” They cite, in particular, analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, whose own model indicated back in mid-December about a 24 percent chance of recession in the coming year. At that point the spread between 3-month and 10-year yields was considerably wider and BMO strategists reckon that “the next recalculation of this model in two weeks will surely show a material increase in the chance of a recession.” The strategists draw particular attention to the 20-basis-point level for the spread, which they say has worked as a gauge for Fed policy in the past few decades. They note that crossings of that threshold in 1989 and several times in the 1990s preceded by a matter of months either a rate pause or cut from the Fed. One outlier was in 2006, when officials carried out four more rate hikes before embarking on an easing cycle.

{"requested_url": "https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/nostalgia/derby-engineer-true-pioneer-who-2385656", "plain_text": "Derby-born Sir Charles Fox was one of the greatest engineers of the 19th century. Remarkably, two of his sons were similarly gifted and successful.  Born in 1810, Charles was baptised at St Werburgh’s Church. He was the youngest son of Wardwick surgeon, Dr Francis Fox, and his wife, Charlotte.  Like his brothers, Charles had seemed destined to enter his father’s calling, but a childhood fascination with mechanics led him in an entirely different direction.  He had shown early promise in that field and had made apparatus for his brother Douglas to use during his lectures at the Mechanics’ Institution in Wardwick. Eventually he took a post studying with the Swedish-American engineer, John Ericsson in Liverpool.  There he participated in the construction of “Novelty” – an early steam locomotive built by Ericsson and John Braithwaite. The engine was entered in the Rainham Trials of October 1829.  It was the favourite to succeed and initially looked set to fulfil its promise. However, a recurring problem with the boiler caused Ericsson and Braithwaite to withdraw it, although it had been widely considered a viable rival to the Stephenson’s Rocket engine.  Fox himself caught the eye of Robert Stephenson, son of George, who offered him a job with his London and Birmingham Railway and, in particular, gave him responsibility for the construction of the Watford Tunnel and the incline over the Regent Canal from Camden Town to Euston.  It proved to be a good appointment. Fox was both imaginative and innovative. In 1832 he patented a new railway track points system known as Fox’s Safety Switch, which superseded the sliding rail that had previously been in use.  But even a man with Fox’s undoubted skills had to face setbacks. In 1834, while overseeing work on the Watford Tunnel, Fox was called away to Birmingham.  While he was there, part of the tunnel workings collapsed, killing 11 workers. It happened on the Friday morning, just as a team of five bricklayers and six labourers removed woodwork from a gin-shaft prior to it being bricked up.  According to a report in the Buckinghamshire Herald of the time: “Had the appalling event taken place a few hours afterwards, the morning gang would have been at work, and the loss of human life must have been awful in the extreme … When the earth fell a horse and gig were partly buried beneath, and it was with great difficulty the horse was extricated, and it was discovered that the poor animal had sustained much injury.”  A subcontractor, a miner and the inspector of brickwork were among the dead. “All of whom have left wives with large families to bemoan their loss.”  Fox hurried back to Watford and, because the surviving labourers refused to get back to work on the project, was forced to complete it with the help of just one ganger.  Eventually, Fox entered a partnership with John Joseph Bramah, and began to manufacture railway and engine components.  He experimented with suspension and girder bridges. When Bramah retired, the company became Fox, Henderson & Co. When Joseph Paxton was planning his Crystal Palace for the Great Exhibition of 1851, Fox’s company was the obvious choice to erect it.  Thanks to an innovative modular design the entire structure took only nine months to complete. In recognition of its success, both Paxton and Fox were knighted. There were celebrations in Fox’s hometown of Derby, too.  In the very year the exhibition opened, Charles’s brother Dr Douglas Fox was serving as mayor of the Borough – one of three times he would fill that post. Dr Fox suspected that he had been chosen because of his brother’s achievements.  According to the Derby Telegraph: “It fell to the lot of Dr Douglas Fox as Mayor to preside at the dinner given to Sir Charles Fox on his Hyde Park achievement.”  After the Exhibition closed, the Crystal Palace Company employed Fox to dismantle the structure, and re-erect it, in enlarged form, at Sydenham Hill – an area now known as Crystal Palace. Derby County would later play in three FA Cup finals there.  The census of 1851, taken about a month before the opening of the Exhibition, shows Charles and his wife Mary, living in Westbourne Terrace in Paddington, in a large and striking townhouse.  Charles is listed as an “engineer and ironfounder”. No less than six servants assisted him and his wife, Mary. Their three sons and one daughter are also living there.  Young Francis would later recall of his father’s involvement in the erection of the Crystal Palace: “He became known as the ‘Cast-Iron Man’. No one but he was able to design the building as regards its details.”  Fox went on to design and construct station roofs at Euston (the first of its kind in the world), Paddington, Waterloo and Birmingham New Street.  In addition, he carried out work for railways across the globe, including the Portadown and Dungannon, the Lyons and Geneva and, with George Berkley, the first narrow-gauge railway in India.  However, in 1856, work with the Danish Zealand railway resulted in such serious financial losses that the Fox Henderson partnership went into liquidation.  The following year, with his sons Charles Douglas (known as Douglas) and Francis, Charles formed a civil engineering partnership, known as Sir Charles Fox & Sons.  The company went on to construct countless bridges – over the Medway at Rochester, and three bridges over the Thames at Barnes, at Richmond, and at Staines among them. He was the first to adopt the cast-iron caisson for the construction of bridge foundations in rivers.  Fox built high-level lines at Battersea, and the approach to Victoria Station in London, as well as widening Grosvenor Bridge over the Thames from two to seven tracks.  Charles Fox died at Blackheath on June 14, 1874, aged 64. An editorial in the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers that year remarked that Fox had “the love and respect of all who knew him … it may indeed be said of him that rarely has there been a more generous man or a more tender and affectionate parent”.  The Derbyshire Advertiser said: “Derby has lost another of her distinguished sons, whose talents have reflected honour upon the town, and whose name will forever be remembered as one of the worthies of Derbyshire.”  One of Sir Charles’ last designs was that for the Mersey Railway Tunnel. Douglas, as the older son, had become senior partner of the firm and it was he who directed the tunnel’s construction.  Douglas himself was knighted for his work by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, after the Mersey Tunnel’s official opening by the Prince of Wales in 1886.  The company’s extraordinary contribution to engineering design and construction went on unabated.  Under Douglas’ guidance it was involved in the construction of the Snowden Mountain Railway and the extension of the Great Central line from Rugby to London, Marylebone Station, the Great Northern and City tube line, Hampstead tube linking Charing Cross with Highgate and Golders Green, as well as the world’s first elevated electrical railway – the Liverpool Overhead.  A railway was constructed in Rhodesia, as well as the 500ft-span Victoria Falls Bridge, the Beneguela Railway in Angola and several more in South America. Francis received his own knighthood in 1912 after work on many of the same projects, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and an extension to the London Underground.  As engineer to the Bristol and Exeter Railway he personally designed the so-called Telescopic Bridge at Bridgwater. He was a consultant for the Simplon Tunnel. In 1878 Fox constructed the replacement train shed at Bristol Temple Meads railway station. In something of a departure from the usual projects, he also assisted in the shoring-up of several cathedrals, including Winchester and St Paul’s.  When Sir Francis died in 1927, one obituary said: “Doctor Fox and his clever family took such immense interest in every educational movement in our town, and were especially active and solicitous in guiding the infant footsteps of the Derby Mechanics’ Institution … the Foxes must have been men of intensely methodical minds.”  Sir Charles, Sir Douglas and Sir Francis were, individually and collectively remarkable engineers indeed.

Bjork Library at Stockton University in December. Brendan Honick is a junior who is part of the LIBA program in which he individualized his own major. As an analytical writing student, he had an internship with Special Collections Librarian, Heather Perez over the summer. His exhibit, “A Century Later: The Spanish Flu in New Jersey,” explores how people in New Jersey lived a century ago, and the challenges they faced when affected by the Spanish flu. Honick studied four different regions of New Jersey that were affected by the Spanish flu including Fort Dix, Newark, Cape May, and Atlantic City. One of Honick’s biggest resources was the Atlantic City Public Library because of the Atlantic City Heritage Collections containing microfilm dating back to the 19th century. As a Linwood native, Honick originally focused his research on how the Spanish flu impacted the people of Cape May and Atlantic City only. In his findings, Honick realized the Spanish flu was so widespread in New Jersey that it was impossible to only focus on one region. “I found that there was so many different anecdotes and stories that I had to include more,” said Honick. Brianna DeCicco, an American Studies graduate student from Barnegat Township, curated an exhibit titled, “Remembering James Cooper’s Civil Rights Activism.” After talking to Heather Perez and being shown the special collections archives, DeCicco knew that’s where to do her internship. Attorney James Cooper’s briefcase, which was donated to Stockton by Cooper’s family after he passed away in 2017, was the focus of DeCicco’s project. James Cooper was an attorney from Atlantic City who spent two weeks in Mississippi in 1966, representing African-Americans during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. Cooper saw first-hand the discrimination and violence African-Americans were facing in the state 50 years ago. The exhibit includes original copies of Cooper’s notes and other court documents that were in his briefcase. Viewing the exhibit is like getting a personal tour of Cooper’s experience in Mississippi during an often frightening time in American history. DeCicco says that honoring impactful historical figures like James Cooper is important because society needs to remember the bigotry people in America have faced since the birth of the United States. “The issues prevalent then are still relevant now,” she said. “There is still racism and violence against African-Americans today, and that needs to change.” DeCicco added that James Cooper was a true civil rights hero. Cooper knew the dangers of going to Mississippi as a civil rights lawyer, but fighting for the rights of the discriminated was more important than the risks.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Students from Linwood, Barnegat, Curated Exhibits at Stockton Library", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Chelsea Doherty", "sitename": "Press of Atlantic City", "image_url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pressofatlanticcity.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/86/686c68ed-ef01-518e-8d23-f7c8f63791c1/5c242273e61bc.image.jpg?crop=1567%2C1175%2C98%2C0&resize=840%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9776393175125122, "responded_url": "https://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/cat/students-from-linwood-barnegat-curated-exhibits-at-stockton-library/article_1583be36-6d37-5286-b5b4-8164f2252fa2.html", "publisher": "pressofatlanticcity.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103044256-00069.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T05:18:29+00:00"}

Jeremy Hunt has ordered an urgent inquiry into the issue after it came to light that victims have either had to pay for plane tickets, basic food and shelter themselves or, if they were over 18, take out emergency loans from Whitehall.  The Foreign Secretary, who is in Singapore at the start of a three-day visit to Asia, made clear that he wanted \"to get to the bottom\" of the issue. \"I have asked officials to give me some proper advice on the whole issue on the basis of seeing this story.  \"Any interventions that I have had on these consular matters I have always stressed to embassies and posts abroad that they need to use discretion.  \"Of course, we should always behave with compassion and humanity in every situation,\" he added.  However, there was a political backlash with one MP likening the latest claims to the Windrush scandal in showing how differently Britons from minorities were treated to their white counterparts.  She tweeted: \"Forced marriage is slavery. For Govt to make victims pay for their freedom is immoral. Ministers need to put this right fast.\"  Her colleague David Lammy branded the policy \"unconscionable\", adding: \"Just like the Windrush scandal yet more evidence of how differently this government is prepared to treat black or brown British citizens.  \"A white woman who had been kidnapped, sold into slavery and raped would never have been asked to pay for her freedom,\" declared the Tottenham MP.  Alison Thewlis, the SNP MP for Glasgow Central, described the claims as “jaw-dropping” as they involved vulnerable young women in unimaginable situations faced with a cruel system of bureaucracy at their time of need.  “It flies in the face of the Prime Minister’s own commitments to tackle violence against women,” she declared. Ms Thewlis called on UK ministers to take urgent action to stop the policy and to investigate why it was introduced at all.  “And importantly, the women who have faced these charges should have every penny repaid. We must also urgently know whether any women have been left without help if they refused or were unable to sign up for these UK Government loans.”  She added: “The UK Government should never put a price tag on vulnerable women’s freedom nor add to their suffering by saddling them with crippling debt.”  Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which monitors the work of the Foreign Office, said the report in The Times was \"astonishing\".  \"[The committee] will ask questions about this decision to charge forced marriage victims to be rescued,\" he tweeted.  The Kent MP said the Foreign Office was rightly proud of the work its forced marriages unit[FMU] did.  But he added: “We shouldn't be charging the most vulnerable for their own protection or dissuading them from asking for it.\"  The Foreign Office, which jointly runs the unit with the Home Office, said it had an obligation to recover money spent on repatriating victims when public money was involved such as the cost of a flight back to the UK.  It is understood the women are not charged for staff costs and the department does not profit from the repatriations. In 2017, it helped 27 victims of forced marriage return to the UK and 55 the year before, according to figures acquired under freedom of information laws.  In the past two years the Foreign Office has lent £7,765 to at least eight forced marriage victims who could not pay for their repatriation.  Around £3,000 has been repaid, although debts of more than £4,500 are outstanding.  Under Foreign Office terms and conditions a surcharge of 10 per cent is added if an emergency loan is not repaid within six months.

Throughout the holiday season, Trump has been largely on his own, holed up at the White House with the exception of a trip to Iraq -- the government shutdown upending his scheduled trip to his Mar-a-Lago club, where his family rang in the new year without him.

A restless President stewing and passing the time with a litany of tweets -- 98 tweets and retweets to be exact -- since the shutdown began at midnight on Saturday, December 22.  \"I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,\" he tweeted Christmas Eve.  The President spent the long hours watching television, phoning advisers and tapping out furious tweets castigating Democrats for opposing his border wall. He invited some allies, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, over for lunch. He did work from the Oval Office for a few hours each day, people familiar with his schedule said, though did not have many formal engagements on his calendar.  Trump burst back into the public eye after six days behind closed doors for a 90-minute session before reporters, bouncing from topic to topic, and trying to make the case for his border wall.  He also reflected on his solo time.  \"I was here on Christmas evening, I was all by myself in the White House, it's a big, big house except for all those guys out on the lawn with machine guns. Nicest machine guns. I was waving to them,\" he told reporters in the Roosevelt Room. (The first lady was at the White House from Christmas Eve through the 27th.)  \"Secret Service and military, these are great people. They don't play games. They don't like waves. They don't even smile,\" Trump said. \"But I was there all alone with the machine gunners, and I felt very safe ... But I was hoping that maybe somebody would come back and negotiate, but they didn't do that.\"  Home alone  Though the partial government shutdown didn't directly affect many White House staff, the West Wing was largely empty due to the holidays. Trump was the first President to spend Christmas at the White House since President Bill Clinton stayed home weeks from ending his tenure in 2000.  The White House press shop, which remained locked to the press for days at a time, did not issue any daily guidance on the President's schedule from the day the shutdown began until Wednesday, failing to account for how Trump spent his days at the White House or any meetings that may have taken place.  His only outing from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the week after his Iraq trip was a visit across town to Vice President Mike Pence's residence, where he dined with Pence, his new acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who made the brief trip back to Washington but was back in Palm Beach the next day.  Trump also passed the time taking a break from his usual cable news viewing for some public broadcasting.  \"I watched last night PBS, I haven't seen it in a while, PBS, and I just noticed, you know, I was in the White House all by myself in the White House for six, seven days, it's very lonely,\" he told reporters Wednesday.  Another factor possibly contributing to that restlessness: a lack of golf. Wednesday ties Trump's previous record for the longest he has gone without golfing as president: 38 days. The last day Trump golfed was November 25 while in Palm Beach for Thanksgiving. Thursday will be the longest he has gone without golfing while in office.  Trump had told several advisers that he believed it would be political suicide to travel to Mar-a-Lago during the shutdown, or even play golf at his resort outside of Washington.  Meanwhile, in Palm Beach ...  Although he repeatedly lamented being alone, Trump was insistent that his family remained in Palm Beach without him while he eschewed his vacation.  \"My family was down in Florida. I said, 'Stay there and enjoy yourself,' but I thought I should be here just in case people wanted to come and negotiate the border security,\" Trump said.  First lady Melania Trump returned from Palm Beach, where she had been spending the holiday with son, Barron, on Christmas Eve. The first couple participated in the annual tradition of taking children's phone calls to NORAD before attending a Christmas Eve service at the National Cathedral and departing on their clandestine trip to Iraq.  Melania Trump traveled back -- her third trip aboard a government plane during the shutdown -- to Palm Beach on December 27, where she hosted the club's annual New Year's Eve bash, a $1,000 ticketed black-tie affair. Since then, Melania Trump has had \"daily calls\" with her husband, a White House official told CNN.  Additionally, Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, former Fox News personality and current America First Policies vice chairwoman Kimberly Guilfoyle, spent the holidays at Mar-a-Lago, along with his ex-wife, Vanessa Trump, who stayed on the club property.  Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were also present in Palm Beach, though Kushner briefly returned to Washington for Friday evening's dinner. Eric Trump and his wife, Lara, spent time at the club over the holidays, departing for Lara's hometown of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, for Christmas, but returning later in the week.  Tiffany Trump spent Christmas with her mother, Marla Maples, in New York City, and then traveled to Asia.  New Year's Eve  In her husband's absence, Melania Trump hosted the New Year's Eve party in a decidedly more low-key manner than usual. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. also stepped into their father's role at the club's festivities, delivering a thank you speech to members, per an attendee.  The duo told the crowd it was the first year that the host wasn't here, but added that he was back at the White House fighting for the country. Some club members had expected the President to appear via video message, but he did not.  To the amusement of attendees at the club's celebration, Guilfoyle took the microphone on the stage to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to the President's eldest son, who turned 41 on December 31, in the style of Marilyn Monroe, presenting him with a cake.  Vanessa Trump was not present for the evening's festivities, but Trump Jr. posted a New Year's Eve photo with three of their five children.  In Washington, it's unclear how the President rang in 2019, or if he stayed awake until midnight. He did, however, wish everyone, \"INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA\" a happy new year via Twitter.  The President's three eldest children and their significant others returned to Washington and New York on Tuesday. The first lady and Barron Trump are expected to remain in Palm Beach for several more days.

Salah has already hit 16 goals this season after scoring 44 last season.  And Mido told CNN : \"You never know in football.

The 32-year-old looks set to leave the Bernabeu and Spanish newspaper Sport suggest Arsenal have made official their interest.  Navas posted a picture with Real Madrid fans on Instagram with the caption ‘Thanks for everything!’.  Roma are also thought to be interested in the Costa Rican international who has fallen behind Thibaut Courtois at Real.  Arsenal signed Bernd Leno from Bayer Leverkusen last summer but could do with another option.  Gunners eye Pepe  Arsenal want to sign Nicolas Pepe in the January transfer window.  Pepe has been attracting interest after some impressive performances for Lille who are currently second in the French table.  The Ivorian has 12 goals and five assists which has brought about attention from a host of Premier League clubs.  The Gunners could move for him after failing to land Roma's Cengiz Under.

Eriksen is believed to be happy at White Hart Lane but his reluctance to sign has brought about a host of suitors from across Europe.

The move by the device maker, which spun off of Netflix in 2008, resembles the lucrative channels business Amazon launched in 2015 that resold video services on an \"a la carte\" basis, which has been copied by a variety of rivals. Apple Inc is expected to launch its own streaming video service that will adopt a similar model, people familiar with the plan have said. Amazon's Channels business, which has been popular among subscribers of Amazon Prime and has been a big revenue contributor for participating media companies, is expected to have generated $1.7 billion in 2018, according to a recent BMO Capital Markets report, more than doubling since 2017. Media executives say the channels business is popular because it removes hurdles for consumers to subscribe to the services where they are already watching television. Like Amazon, Roku will handle the billing for these services, allowing viewers to subscribe directly from the Roku Channel instead of needing to go somewhere else to plug in credit card information.

Privately-owned developer Mizen Group shared its experience and insight with best practice in the sector as part of the annual Property Edition of The Parliamentary Review.  Each edition focuses on an individual governmental policy area such as finance, healthcare, transport, education, technology and energy.  Co-chaired by Lord Blunkett and Lord Eric Pickles, The Parliamentary Review sets out to share best practice amongst policymakers and business leaders, consisting of discussion from award-winning journalists and business leaders.  It is also distributed to business executives and policymakers across the UK.  Founded in the UK by the current executive chairman Bernard Tansey, from Sligo, in 1986, the Mizen Group company focuses on creating fairly priced residential and commercial property units across the private and public sectors within London and South East of England.  The company also say they specialise in new-build, refurbishment and conservation area regeneration, with a focus on straightforward contracts, sensible land acquisition and business planning.  Mr Tansey intends to tackle major issues affecting the sector such as planning regulation, the impact of Brexit and the necessity for a healthy SME Sector in the UK economy.  “Bringing over thirty years of operational experience to the table, Mizen Group has survived and thrived through major changes to the UK property development sector, which gives us a unique perspective on how the system is working and how it can be improved for the benefit of businesses and customers,” Mr Tansey said.  “We’re delighted to share our views within this year’s edition of The Parliamentary Review and look forward to working with Lord Eric Pickles and our industry-leading peers in the future.”  In their contribution to the Parliament Review, the company said that they prefer graduates and “professionally qualified people” as their team leaders because the “discipline and decision-making skills required cannot be easily substituted”.  “Our clients recognise that our ethics and integrity are fundamental to our business. Our projects are delivered on time and budget, thanks to carefully selected development teams, put together by our management,” the firm said.  The London-based company also said they would have preferred for the UK to have stayed in the EU due to the pool of “competent” workers that can be tapped into. These workers, the firm said, “drive their business and the UK economy”.  “There are 2.4 million EU workers in the UK, and 30 per cent of construction workers in London are EU nationals,” it added.  “EU migrants are necessary for the British construction industry to support the maintenance and expansion of economic activity and to counter the effects of falling UK birth rates.  “We fear that a number of skilled and unskilled workers from the EU may leave because of an inadequate Brexit deal and the prolonged uncertainty.  “Recently, we have encountered sales resistance on several of our sites and this is an issue that is not just affecting the construction industry.”  The co-chairman of The Parliamentary Review, Lord Pickles, has praised the current issue as one of the most comprehensive yet.  He commented that as Britain undergoes change, it is ”essential that politicians have a firm understanding of the challenges with which British organisations must contend” and this year’s annual edition once again provides a perfect platform for this.  Theresa May, the British PM, wrote in the same publication that “British politics provides ample material for analysis in the pages of The Parliamentary Review.”  The Parliamentary Review tends to include political commentary from journalists, secretaries of state, ministers and MPs.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "London construction company chosen to explain best practice - The Irish World", "tags": "executive chairman Bernard Tanse;FREE;Parliamentary Review;The Mizen Group", "categories": "View All;Business News;Ireland;World;UK;News", "author": null, "sitename": "The Irish World", "image_url": "http://www.theirishworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Parliamentary-Review-image.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9601706266403198, "responded_url": "http://www.theirishworld.com/london-construction-company-chosen-to-explain-best-practice/", "publisher": "theirishworld.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103113843-00071.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T13:46:53+00:00"}

Deer in southwest Colorado Springs are estimated at 20 per square mile, well above the two or three deer typically found in healthy rural areas elsewhere in the state. Overpopulation can lead to an outbreak of disease among the animals, raises the number of animals struck by vehicles, damages the environment and private property and, in extreme cases, mass starvation for the deer. The deer population in the city has reached its biological carrying capacity, said Frank McGee, area wildlife manager for state Parks and Wildlife. “That’s where the number of deer in the landscape start negatively impacting the environment,” McGee said. “There are places in town where you can see pretty distinct browse lines, where everything that grows on a tree or a bush that a deer can reach has been eaten.” A tightly regulated urban hunting program, involving bows and arrows instead of firearms, was thought to be the most effective and financially viable option to reduce the city’s deer population. Similar programs across the country have found varying degrees of success — the Air Force Academy has a successful deer hunting program that began in 1988. Knight reiterated that the city would control who could particulate the hunt and when and where it would allowed. Despite that, there were worries about negative consequences. One specific concern, Knight said, is that deer shot with arrows tend to continue moving and will often die a distance from where they were hit. “The last thing we’d want to do is traumatize some little kid seeing a deer going down the street with blood pouring out of it,” Knight said. Of the other options available, trapping and sterilization have proven to be relatively ineffective and expensive, McGee said. Realistically, the lethal options control herd sizes best. Knight said the council wants more information before committing to a lethal option. “We want to get a handle on the size of the herd and is it growing?” he said. In addition, Knight said he wants more information on how healthy the population is. About a deer a day is being killed by vehicles, according to city staff who have to retrieve the carcasses, Knight said. Those deer can be tested for diseases after they’re cleared from the roadways. While lethal options are tabled for now, the council isn’t stopping its efforts to curb the problem. In November, it approved a ban on feeding wildlife, including not just deer, but also bears, skunks, raccoons, wolves, coyotes, foxes, moose and antelope. Violations of the new ordinance are noncriminal civil infractions and can result in a written warning. Citations can also be written and enforced by the city’s Code Enforcement Department. Over the next two years, Knight said the city will continue to collect more data and discuss safe and effective ways to curtail the deer population. In that time, experts can consider two additional factors, McGee said. The first is the city’s biological carrying capacity, which is the size a deer herd can reach before the animals begin starving to death, McGee said. And in an urban environment such as Colorado Springs, that point might never be reached. The second is the social carrying capacity. “What’s people’s willingness or tolerance to deal with wildlife?” McGee said. “How many collisions with vehicles is too many? How much property damage is too much? How do people feel about the number of deer and the conflicts they’re causing?”", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Urban hunt to control Colorado Springs' deer population tabled — for now", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Conrad Swanson", "sitename": "The Colorado Springs Gazette, L.L.C.", "image_url": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/26/526cebce-0938-11e9-9a82-33584474efe3/5b2045da04776.image.jpg?resize=840%2C630", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9579440951347351, "responded_url": "https://gazette.com/cheyenneedition/urban-hunt-to-control-colorado-springs-deer-population-tabled-for/article_cf6dbe4c-0937-11e9-9485-b72f838ad67b.html", "publisher": "gazette.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102174131-00066.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T19:59:04+00:00"}

I had just sat down in the living room to drink my chocolate milk and gazed out the window. Way down in the trees something black moved. Was it a bear? Too dark for the deer that wander throughout the area. Hum? Did Jack have some binoculars? Didn’t have the faintest idea where they might be – still don’t!  Checked again. Oh, it looked like a giant bird. Just then a bald-headed eagle flew low taking a closer look then swooped up and landed in the nearby pine tree. I decided the giant bird must be a golden eagle; and then two more golden eagles (they were smaller) flew low through the trees. By this time, I could tell the first eagle was rapidly tearing at something – eating. The bald eagle was hungry and wanted a bite of breakfast, too, so he swooped-down landing 15 feet or so away from the golden eagle. Seemingly impatient, he walked towards the golden eagle, who menacingly flapped his wings. He was bigger and was not going to share!  About that time, one of the smaller golden eagles tried to dive bomb the bald eagle. Guess they were buddies and in cahoots. The bald eagle extended his wings and was immediately airborne, flew around the pine tree and swooped past my window with the two smaller golden eagles gliding behind him. During this time, I could see smaller birds hopping around in the lower-limbs of the trees and the ground. A lot of attention was being paid to whatever was being devoured. I figured it must have been a dead deer, because the breakfast crowd was growing.  How much longer before the big golden eagle would have his fill and the next birds could eat, I wondered. After 10 minutes or so, the bald eagle did not make any more appearances and I didn’t see the other two goldens either. And then the big golden was gone.  After all that commotion, I decided to go check and see what the prey may have been. Nope, it wasn’t a deer. No deer bones, but lots of tufts of grey-white hair with white under-fluff. Then I saw a remaining tendon. I rubbed the fur. Soft. Must have been a rabbit. Wow, all of that dramatic posturing over a little ol’ jack rabbit?  It is winter and the mice, squirrels, rats and other small animals are not in abundance. Believe it or not, I actually hoped all the other eagles and birds were able to fill their bellies on that cold winter morning, which would be the tragic end to smaller animals.  This reminded me of the pecking order I saw years ago. A young buck ran into me on the big turn between Fay Lane and French Creek on Hwy 3. (Yep, he ran into me!) He took out my headlight, but I had slammed on the brakes and didn’t kill him. He had jumped the fence into the field. So, I thought, he might live.  The next day as I was driving by that spot, I noticed several golden eagles eating ravenously about 50-feet from the fence. It was the buck – dead. There were three eagles and they were actually sharing enough to call it “group” dining. I was so amazed that I stopped the car and was able to get a photo. The biggest golden stared me down. It was his food and I was not welcome. I was shocked that the big one did not fly away. Hum, I need to find that photo.  As I drove by the next day, two bald headed eagles were filling their bellies and I spotted several red tailed hawks, black ravens and smaller birds waiting for their turns. I stopped to take a photo, but the bald eagles were camera shy and flew off. Cars could drive by at 55 miles per hour, but if one slowed down the bald eagles and hawks were gone. For several days, I tried to get photos of the bald eagles and have blurred photos to prove it.  I drove by twice a day and noticed that the bigger birds were eating in the morning and the smaller birds ate on the carcass in the afternoon. About the third day, I saw something that proves there is truly a pecking order in the world of wildlife – and it starts with the biggest to the smallest. It was fairly early in the morning and I was still hoping to get a clear photo of the bald eagles. Having learned the birds were more likely to ignore me if I slowed my car speed well before I was to the scene, I looked out and there were the three golden eagles eating and about 15 feet away the two bald eagles were standing – waiting for their turns. About eight feet back from them were several hawks and not far behind them were a semicircle of black ravens. Then there were blue jays, starlings, other birds that I don’t know their names and very small birds on the outer edge.  These birds formed a half circle on the northeast side away from Highway 3. And the half circle of largest to the smallest was nearly perfect. This was not a scattered crowd. The order was specific as was the space between each group.  Oh, how I wanted to get a photo! This was one of the most interesting things I had ever witnessed and couldn’t prove it with a photo. Instinctively, I knew if I slowed much more the eagles would be the first to fly away. Chickens!  So there you have it, my remembrance of the buck I – accidentally – killed, feeding a lot of birds.  Liz Bowen began writing ranch and farm news, published in newspapers, in 1976.

Silly question, right? A new study tells us carrying Tasers increases police use of force. Cambridge University looked at use the use of Tasers by the City of London police. It found that “the presence of electroshock devices led to greater overall hostility in police-public interactions”. It’s the “weapons effect”. What of a police truncheon, then – although they now prefer the Casco baton constructed of carbon steel coated with a black chrome finish? Is the threat of being electrocuted greater than that of being beaten?  Last October, an investigation ruled that a police officer who Tasered a man shortly before his death should not have held the trigger for such a long time. The man died of cardiac arrest. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found that the officer extended the use of a Taser longer than the automatic five seconds.  The study:   A new study has found that London police officers visibly armed with electroshock ‘Taser’ weapons used force 48% more often, and were more likely to be assaulted, than those on unarmed shifts.  However, while use of force can include everything from restraint and handcuffing to CS spray, the Tasers themselves were only fired twice during the year-long study period. “We found that officers are more likely to be assaulted when carrying electroshock weaponry, and more likely to apply force,” said lead researcher Dr Barak Ariel from Cambridge’s Institute of Criminology. “It is well established that the visual cue of a weapon can stimulate aggression. While our research does not pierce the ‘black box’ of decision-making, the only difference between our two study conditions was the presence of a Taser device. There was no increase in injury of suspects or complaints, suggesting it was not the police instigating hostilities. The presence of Tasers appears to provoke a pattern where suspects become more aggressive toward officers, who in turn respond more forcefully.”  Adding: “If the presence of weapons can lead to aggression by suspects, so its concealment should be able to reduce aggression and increase officer safety.”  What if the police officer is aggressive? A Taser can be a hands off way of assaulting the target – and less potentially fatal than shooting them. This video is from the USA shows what happens when you’re a 72-year-old woman who allegedly sped thought a construction zone:      \n \n  The BBC tells us:   Black people are three times more likely than white people to be involved in Taser incidents, government figures suggest.  Electric stun guns were drawn, aimed or fired 38,000 times in England and Wales over a period of five years.  In more than 12% of cases Tasers were used against black people, who make up about 4% of the population, Home Office figures suggested… Don’t be black, young and thin:   …the body which represents senior police officers admits there is “an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia and barb penetration in children and thin adults”. But you can hit people with a baton and leave no bruise – allegedly.

While the shutdown looms over Capitol Hill, it wasn’t diminishing the return to power of Democrats, as the halls of the House office buildings were humming with last minute preparations for the start of the 116th Congress, as the staff of new lawmakers got settled in their offices, amid halls crowded with trash bins, extra furniture, packing crates, empty computer boxes, mounds of tangled computer wires, and a lengthy line of staffers getting their Congressional ID cards.  But all of that couldn’t obscure the historic nature of the 116th Congress.  The number of women in the House will be a record, as will the number of minorities; the first Muslim women will be sworn into office, the first Native American woman, the first Palestinian-American, the first Korean-American, as white men will find themselves to be a minority within the Democratic Party.  “I spent 2018 fighting for the chance to make a change,” said Lucy McBath, who won a seat in the Atlanta suburbs for Democrats. “In 2019, I will continue this fight to serve my constituents and the people of this great country.”  McBath’s name plate was up on the wall along with dozens of other new members, as over 20 percent of the House – more than one of every five lawmakers – will be new to the Congress in 2019, just shy of the turnover from the Tea Party wave election of 2010, which benefited Republicans.  The signs of change were everywhere in the halls, with stacks of packing crates, TV camera crews, friends and family of new lawmakers, and clear messages from new Democrats about the change they hope to bring.  “Who would pick their office in here?” a woman asked me as we navigated by a number of hallway obstacles on the eve of the new Congress.  At the office of Rashida Tlaib of Michigan – a hand written sign made clear her desire to do more than just be a member of Congress.    On the other side of the aisle, the change in power in the House will be something new for many Republicans who will serve in the new Congress.  “I’ve never been in the minority before,” said Rep. Rob Woodall (R-GA), who narrowly survived a strong Democratic challenge in his suburban Atlanta district, emblematic of the struggles that GOP lawmakers had across the country.  Woodall said he hoped there could be bipartisanship on everything from the budget, to infrastructure spending – and the issue looming over everything else right now – immigration.  “We need to do it,” Woodall said of immigration reform, acknowledging that Republicans had failed in the last two years to get any bill to President Trump’s desk.  “Every day we don’t do it, it’s worse for everybody,” Woodall added, as many Democrats believe the political fallout on immigration is one which benefits them at this point, and not the President or GOP lawmakers in Congress.  One Republican who thought he had won election to the House – Mark Harris of North Carolina – won’t be present when members of the 116th Congress are sworn in, as allegations of election fraud in North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District have left that office vacant.    In the interim – while it’s determined whether there will be an entirely new election in North Carolina – the office of the Ninth District will be staffed, and directed by the Office of the Clerk of the House, but there won’t be a member of Congress for that seat until later this year.  Another newly-elected Republican, Ross Spano of Florida, was opening his House office on Wednesday like other lawmakers, even as questions continued over election law violations that he admitted after the 2018 election, acknowledging that he funneled personal loans into his campaign, wrongly characterizing the contributions as his own money.  It was not apparent if Spano would be subjected to any investigation by the House Ethics Committee, but there was no talk that he would be barred from taking his seat in the House.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "As shutdown continues, Democrats take charge of House in 116th Congress", "tags": "Politics,Jamie Dupree, StoryKeywords", "categories": "Politics", "author": "WPXI", "sitename": "WPXI", "image_url": "https://mediaweb.wpxi.com/photo/2019/01/03/mcbath11_14137334_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9758724570274353, "responded_url": "https://www.wpxi.com/news/politics/as-shutdown-continues-democrats-take-charge-of-house-in-116th-congress/898273993", "publisher": "wpxi.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103044256-00069.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T05:41:56+00:00"}

The research team, led by Dr. Sarah Mbaeyi from the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the finding highlights the urgent need to ensure that all students get vaccinated against the disease before they head off to a university.  \"Meningitis B is an uncommon but potentially deadly bacterial infection that leads to inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord,\" explained Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.  A meningitis B infection may \"also may lead to meningococcal sepsis, or bacteria invading the bloodstream,\" added Glatter, who was not part of the study. \"The combination of these factors can make it lethal in less than 24 hours.\"  The latest findings essentially confirm long-standing fears about college-related vulnerabilities, given that \"the bacteria that leads to meningitis B lives in the nose and throat and can be spread by close contact from coughing, sneezing or kissing,\" Glatter noted.  \"The truth is that health care professionals have always been concerned about the heightened risk of meningitis among college students living in close quarters together and sharing drinks and utensils,\" he explained.  That thought was seconded by Dr. Lucila Marquez, an assistant professor of pediatrics in the section of pediatric infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, in Houston. She said that \"college freshmen living in residence halls were previously known to have an increased risk for other forms of meningococcal disease.\"  When the meningitis B vaccine first became available in 2015, college students were not recognized as a high-risk group and not recommended for routine vaccination.  But \"it's important for college attendees to be vaccinated, because vaccination is the only reliable means of preventing devastating meningococcal disease,\" said Marquez, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.  Continued  Vaccination could help protect both the 10 percent to 15 percent of meningitis B patients who ultimately die from their infection, and those who survive the disease only to endure serious long-term health consequences.  Given that over one-third of meningitis infections occur among young Americans aged 16 to 23, Marquez stressed that parents \"should feel confident that MenB vaccines are safe.\"  During their investigation, Mbaeyi and her team identified 166 cases of some form of meningococcal disease (including B, C and Y infections) between 2014 and 2016 among Americans aged 18 to 24. Of those, 83 were college students.  Among the student group, more than three-quarters of the infections were meningitis B, the investigators found. This compared with less than 40 percent of the meningitis cases cited among non-college patients.  The findings were published in the January issue of the journal Pediatrics.  Still, Glatter observed that the overall risk for contracting meningitis B remains \"low,\" even among college students. The CDC concurs, noting that in 2016 there was a total of about 370 cases of all forms of meningococcal disease across all age groups in the United States.  However, \"the reality is that we need to better inform parents and health care providers about the importance of vaccinating college students against this potentially deadly illness,\" said Glatter. \"It's simply not worth taking the risk, even in light of the low prevalence of this disease.\"", "published_date": "2019-02-01", "title": "Deadly Meningitis B Targets College Students", "tags": "meningitis, meningitis vaccine, college, close quarters, contagious, bacterial infection, inflammation, brain, spinal cord, coughing, sneezing, kissing", "categories": "", "author": null, "sitename": "WebMD", "image_url": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/video/webmd_meningitis_overview_video/650x350_webmd_meningitis_overview_video.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9749872088432312, "responded_url": "https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20190102/deadly-meningitis-b-targets-college-students?src=RSS_PUBLIC", "publisher": "webmd.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103083914-00070.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T10:42:53+00:00"}

Kalluri had been transferred out of Bastar in February 2017 after a mob attack on activist and scholar Bela Bhatia. He was posted in the training department in the police headquarters. A month later, he was sent notices for indiscipline after he attended an event where a police officer said human rights activists should be crushed on the roads. A leaked internal memo of the Central Bureau of Investigation showed that the agency suspected Kalluri’s involvement in alleged police-led arson in three Adivasi villages in 2011. Kalluri was then the senior superintendent of police in Dantewada and has been named as the officer responsible for the encounter which saw over 300 homes being burnt in Tadmetla. Three men were killed and three women were raped in Tadmetla, Morpalli and Timmapuram in Dantewada during his tenure. However, these details did not feature in the agency’s final report. The National Human Rights Commission has in the past sent Kalluri notices for a hearing into the several cases of alleged human rights violation against him. However, he has avoided both the hearings, citing personal reasons. The Congress government led by Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel was widely expected to investigate Kalluri’s track record of alleged human rights violations.

Bush a 'loser' and apologized Former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid is calling President Trump the 'worst' in the nation's history as he faces a cancer diagnosis that has failed to blunt his political jabs. Reid, 79, unloaded on Trump in an interview for the first time since doctors discovered a lesion on his pancreas. 'Trump is an interesting person. He is not immoral but is amoral. Amoral is when you shoot someone in the head, it doesn't make a difference. No conscience,' Reid told the New York Times. 'I think he is without question the worst president we've ever had,' he continued. 'We've had some bad ones, and there's not even a close second to him.' Former Senate leader Harry Reid called President Trump 'without question the worst president we've ever had' in an interview following his own cancer diagnosis 'He'll lie. He'll cheat. You can't reason with him,' said Reid, who represented Democrats in countless face-offs with Republicans as both a minority and a majority leader, ultimately helping to push through much of President Obama's agenda. Reid, a former amateur boxer who once ran the Nevada gaming commission, was asked about comparisons between President Trump and a mob boss. Former FBI Director James Comey and others have made it. 'Organized crime is a business,' Reid said, 'and they are really good with what they do. But they are better off when things are predictable. In my opinion, they do not do well with chaos. And that's what we have going with Trump,' he said. Reid said President Trump has 'no conscience' and is 'amoral' Landra Reid (L) and her husband, former U.S. Sen.

When the reporter, who identifies as Jewish, showed up at Reid's Henderson, Nevada 'McMansion,' Reid pointed to a large gold menorah on his desk. 'I put this out here because I knew you were coming,' he said. Reid's wife, Landra, was born Jewish, but it is unclear whether he put it out for the Channukah-sesason interview or if it was already there. Reid, who was partially blinded in a home accident involving an exercise band in 2015, also spoke bluntly about his own health and longevity facing cancer. 'As soon as you discover you have something on your pancreas, you're dead,' he said. He received the bad diagnosis in May. Reid once called former President George W.

So far, only three major competitions were hosted at The Dome in Swakopmund and Iron House in Windhoek respectively because it requires adequate sponsorship to organize and host such events.  Local bodybuilders reached out to South African competitions to gain experience and be exposed to high-level competition in this particular sport. And though competition is tough for local bodybuilders, it is determination and self-discipline as well as persistent exercise programs that enable these athletes to develop their bodies in a competitive spirit. \r\nThe South African IFBB hosted the annual Gentle Giant Classics event from the 24 to 27 of last month in Boksburg, near Johannesburg.  The competition served as qualifier for Arnold Classics 2019 and saw five Namibians in action in the shape of Romario Van Wyk, Panduleni Nekomba, Norman Van Wyk, Eclesiaste Celestino and Svet-Roann Loubser.  \r\nThe final placing reads as follows: \r\nRomario Van Wyk - 4th in Senior Classic Bodybuilding \r\nPanduleni Nekomba - 4th in Muscular Men’s Physique \r\nNorman Van Wyk – No Placing in Master’s Over 40 years of age \r\nEclesiaste Celestino -  2nd in Men’s Muscular Physique \r\nSvet-Roann Loubser - 2nd in Beach Bikini The phenomenal IFBB Professional League Muscle Mulisha Grand Prix III Bodybuilding Showcase, also held from the 24 to 27 of last month is also a qualifier for the World Championship Pro League Bodybuilding Showcase. \r\nAnother group of Namibian athletes participated in this event in the hope of getting an invitation to the world championships. Chantal Williams, Nadia Minnie, Natasha Kotze and the family duo Hess Robinson with her son Robbie did not hesitate to flex their muscles at the said gathering. Well known Windhoek based bodybuilder Chantal Williams, boasts years of experience and showed off her best to claim a gold medal in the Fitness Bikini Division. Another Windhoeker Nadia Minnie, completed her 5th competition securing 2nd spot in Ladies Master Figure Division, in addition to her 1st place in Ladies Class B (up to 168cm) Figure division while Natasha Kotze flexed out a silver medal in the Ladies Wellness Division.  The young Robbie Robinson tackled his first ever competition with all earnest finishing 3rd in the men’s Physique Junior under 23-years of age Division. He transited to the next event, which was the Men’s Physique up to 173cm and settled for 4th spot on the podium.  This is a major achievement for the young man and an achievement, which he said was the most valued as he competed against men with years of experience. This was Hess Robinson’s 2nd competition and she had to settle with a seventh place in the Ladies Master Fitness Bikini.  Expenses incurred during these competitions are massive and for Namibians to be able to attend these competitions abroad, the athletes need to dig deep in their pockets to cover transport, accommodation, hairdo, spray tan etc.  Staff Reporter 2018-11-06 10:28:11 1 months ago", "published_date": "2018-11-06", "title": "Local bodybuilders record great results in SA Competition", "tags": "", "categories": "Sports", "author": "Staff Reporter", "sitename": "New Era Live", "image_url": "https://neweralive.na/assets/img/placeholder-social.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9495080709457397, "responded_url": "https://neweralive.na/posts/local-bodybuilders-record-great-results-in-sa-competition", "publisher": "neweralive.na", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102122114-00064.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T14:57:11+00:00"}

A Menomonee Falls company released an energy-sharing product for groups of residences VILLAGE OF MENOMONEE FALLS - Local company EnSync Inc. has launched a capability that allows networks of residences to share the wealth of their extra energy. The company describes EnSync Smart Home as a \"true peer-to-peer\" exchange of energy. Specifically, Smart Home can accommodate situations including vacancies, vacations or general absences during times of high-energy generation. Dan Nordloh, executive vice president of EnSync, said Smart Home is a scaled-down version of what the company offers to commercial and industrial clients. It focuses on residential groups like apartments, townhomes, suburbs or condominiums. \"It enables greater energy independence for people who want it,\" Nordloh said about Smart Home. \"And people can utilize its solar energy compatibility to very safely power their home in the event of a power outage.\" Smart Home works by linking residential utility meters together in any given area. It uses the internet to generate those connections and can be set up either inside or outside. Nordloh noted that individual residences can also get Smart Home if they'd like, without having their neighbors participate in it. For group scenarios, the product is being marketed to property owners and developers. EnSync CEO and president Brad Hansen said there will be at least two Wisconsin units receiving Smart Home during its country-wide rollout in January. It's an addition to EnSync's Home Energy System, that debuted in May, which combines electronic power grids, as well as homes off the grid. Top Headlines Around the Community: Posted!

Military prosecutors say they have evidence to charge Gallagher with premeditated murder and attempted murder for allegedly slicing the throat of a 15-year-old combatant with a hunting knife, according to KNSD-TV. The 39-year-old also posed next to the militant's body for photos in Mosul in May, 2017, prosecutors claim. He has also been accused of performing a re-enlistment ceremony alongside the corpse and in front on American flag, according to prosecutors. Afterwards, Gallagher allegedly text a photo of the body to a fellow SEAL, writing: 'I got him with my hunting knife.' A couple of months later, he also allegedly fired at a male and female noncombatant. Edward Gallagher is said to have stabbed a teenage ISIS fighter in the neck and body before posing with the boy's body Prosecutors also claim to have evidence that Gallagher tried to bribe fellow Navy SEALs not to cooperate with Naval Criminal Investigative Service officers. The Navy has charged Chief Gallagher with premeditated murder, attempted murder and nearly a dozen other offenses, including obstruction of justice and bringing 'discredit upon the armed forces'. Gallagher has denied the allegations. His lawyer argues that the 15-year-old ISIS fighter was killed in an aerial strike, and not by his client. Phil Stackhouse, a private attorney hired by Gallagher, said fellow SEALs turned him in because he was too tough on them. Gallagher will be arraigned at Naval Base San Diego on Friday. If convicted, he could face life behind bars. Gallagher's wife and the mother of his children, Andrea, also said in an interview: 'This is not who Eddie is. 'He is a lifesaver. He is that guy who runs into the burning building when other people are running out.' Gallagher, a sniper and a medic, has served overseas in different deployments for 19 years. Sean Gallagher (right) said his brother Edward is innocent of any crime and can be described as a 'modern day' war hero who has served as a Navy Seal for 19 years After his latest tour, he was named named the top platoon leader in SEAL Team 7 and nominated for the Silver Star, the military’s third-highest honor, The New York Times reported. However the disturbing allegations from the same deployment have since come to light. Gallagher is said to have 'with premeditation, murder a wounded male person' under his care by 'stabbing him in the neck and body with a knife,' CNN reported. An organization of Navy SEALs - Brotherhood Beyond Battlefield - has launched a fundraising drive to help Gallagher. The group says the charges are 'drummed up' and slammed the 'thugs' of NCIS for using 'Gestapo tactics' in arresting Gallagher at his home in September. So far, the group has raised nearly $200,000 toward Gallagher's defense. Sean Gallagher, Edward's brother, accused those investigating the case of trying to advance their own careers. Edward Gallawyer, is a married father-of-three and a highly lauded special warfare operator who has racked up numerous awards during his eight tours of duty. Sean Gallagher told Fox and Friends: ‘This investigation is not about justice and the truth, it’s about a win. ‘A SEAL is a shiny, golden nail where if you take them down it makes you look good,’ he added. 'My brother represents what is best about this country. He fulfilled a family tradition that we have of joining the service. 'If you were to imagine or create what a modern day war hero would be, it would be Eddie'. Edward was in the process of transitioning to a non-combat advisory role for the Navy SEALs when he was taken into custody in September, according to his brother. Gallagher was planning to retire in the spring. If convicted , Gallagher could face life in prison and it is expected that a trial will begin in 2019 Edward Gallagher, seen here with his wife Andrea, is currently in a military prison in California and his three children had to visit him there for Thanksgiving Prosecutors argued that Gallagher was detained for trying to intimidate witnesses to the crimes he is alleged to have committed. However Sean tells Fox News claimed that his brother was expressing opinions in text messages to his friends, some who were contacted by the NCIS regarding the allegations against his brother. If he is convicted, he could spend the rest of his life in prison. Sean claimed that Navy seals serving under his brother 'fabricated stories' because they weren't combat ready. After his latest tour, fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq, he was named the top platoon leader in SEAL Team 7 and nominated for the Silver Star, the military’s third-highest honor. Sean Gallagher (left) said 'disgruntled' seals serving under his brother 'fabricated stories' because they weren't combat ready and his brother (right) was a high He fought in Iraq and Afghanistan several times and has been a Navy Seal for 14 years. During a preliminary hearing in November, prosecutors presented accounts from several other SEALs in Chief Gallagher’s platoon describing his behavior as reckless and bloodthirsty. They said he fired into civilian crowds, gunned down a girl walking along a riverbank and an old man carrying a water jug, and threatened to kill fellow SEALs if they reported his actions. In May last year, Iraqi forces in Mosul caught an Islamic State fighter aged in his teens, who was left battered and bloody from the combat. Investigators allege while the teen was receiving medical treatment from SEAL medics, Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in his neck and side with a knife, killing the fighter. Then, they say, he posed for photographs with the fighter’s body, holding his head in one hand and his blade in the other – and sent one of the images to a fellow SEAL with the caption: 'I got him with my hunting knife'. Edward was charged in October with multiple crimes in connection with the 2017 stabbing death of a detainee in Iraq Some platoon members were so distraught by the chief’s actions, investigators said, that they tampered with his sniper rifle to make it less accurate, and fired warning shots to scare away civilians before the chief had a chance to shoot them. 'They said they spent more time protecting civilians than they did fighting ISIS', Special Agent Joe Warpinski of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service told the military court, according to a report in The New York Times. Stackhouse said the charges were baseless. He said the only evidence that the chief had killed anyone came from accounts offered by a few SEALs who were disgruntled because they could not meet their leader’s demanding standards. 'I promise you, we will call many more SEALs who will say none of this ever happened,' Stackhouse was quoted as saying by the Times. The purpose of the hearing, known as an Article 32 hearing, was to determine whether the case should proceed to a trial. Both sides have indicated that they believe the trial will proceed this year. Navy prosecutor Chris Czaplak said during the November hearing that the chief had done damage beyond murder and had undermined the values of the Navy Seals. 'Does the public still believe we are the good guys, because Chief Gallagher decided to act like the monster the terrorists accuse us of being?', he said. 'He handed ISIS propaganda manna from heaven. His actions are everything ISIS says we are'.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Officer who 'sliced throat of ISIS combatant' charged with war crimes", "tags": "Navy,Seal,sliced,throat,wounded,15,year,old,ISIS,combatant,Iraq,charged,war,crimes;Navy Seal sliced throat wounded 15 year old ISIS combatant Iraq charged war crimes", "categories": "News", "author": "Ariel Zilber", "sitename": "Mail Online", "image_url": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/02/22/8067422-0-image-a-4_1546469887602.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.985135555267334, "responded_url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6549959/Navy-Seal-sliced-throat-wounded-15-year-old-ISIS-combatant-Iraq-charged-war-crimes.html", "publisher": "dailymail.co.uk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T23:18:08+00:00"}

Okerlund had battled kidney issues, but the specifics on the cause of his death — which came just weeks after a fall — weren’t immediately known.  Okerlund did it all in pro wrestling — interviewing, announcing and commentating, working across the industry from the American Wrestling Association starting in 1970, to the World Wrestling Federation to World Championship Wrestling before returning to WWF, which was rebranded as World Wrestling Entertainment. The Sisseton, S.D., native lived in Burnsville for about 20 years. It’s where he raised his children before eventually moving south to Florida in the mid-1990s. While he looked nothing like an athlete and rarely stepped into the ring, Okerlund was one of the sport’s biggest stars. “Triple H” — WWE executive vice president of talent, live events and creative Paul Michael Levesque — tweeted that Okerlund was “a voice and sound track to an entire era of our industry.” An industry Okerlund came to work for almost entirely by accident. Tor said his father was originally a disc jockey, working for KDWB and WDGY. He then moved on from his broadcasting roots to sell spot TV times for WTCN channel 11 before opening his own ad agency. Tor said it was an on-air talent strike that gave Okerlund opportunities to get in front of the camera, doing news, a day-time show and, yes, even wrestling. Okerlund repeatedly was called back after his first couple of appearances. “Quite by accident, the wrestling thing stuck,” Tor said. “It was definitely his gig.” First and foremost, pro wrestling is entertainment. And Tor said his father was “the consummate entertainer.” He produced entertaining back and forths with the likes of Randy Macho Man Savage, Sid Vicious and Andre the Giant and even trained with Hulk Hogan. “Very seldom does an interviewer become just as popular, and at times even more popular, than the superstars he/she interviews,” former wrestling Kurt Angle tweeted. “Gene Okerlund was that person.” Tor said to the best of his knowledge it was former Minnesota Governor Jesse “The Body” Ventura who gave his father the “Mean Gene” nickname. “In the world of wrestling, flash means everything,” Tor said. “I think Jesse Ventura understood that. He worked it for himself and he worked it for everybody else around him, including my dad.” In reality, the nickname was ironic. Okerlund was “beloved by all who got to work with him,” according to Levesque. Ric Flair tweeted that Okerlund is one of his “closest friends.” Stone Cold Steve Austin tweeted that Okerlund was “untouchable. Simply the best. Total professional with quick wit, sarcasm, humor and that golden voice.” Tor said his father was “totally passionate,” about wrestling and broadcasting alongside many of the sport’s most notable personalities. “(He) loved the business, loved the people,” Tor said. “It’s really all he wanted to do, so he was a lucky guy in that respect. He was great at it, and that’s what he loved to do.” Tor said his father worked as recently as a month ago. “It was definitely the people that he worked with and his passion for the business and entertainment that continued to drive him to work all the way until the time of his death,” Tor said, “so it’s a pretty wonderful thing.”", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "‘Mean Gene’ Okerlund was one of professional wrestling’s biggest stars", "tags": "Obituaries", "categories": "Celebrities", "author": "Jace Frederick", "sitename": "Twin Cities", "image_url": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Obit_Okerlund_827111.jpg?w=1024&h=576", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9887199997901917, "responded_url": "https://www.twincities.com/2019/01/02/mean-gene-okerlund-was-one-of-professional-wrestlings-biggest-stars/", "publisher": "twincities.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T23:19:23+00:00"}

VHP working president Alok Kumar said, “I do not know what is in his (PM’s) mind, but we are clear that instead of bringing in a legislation after completion of the judicial process, that legislation should be brought now. We will keep urging the government to bring in a legislation in Parliament in the current tenure.”  In a statement on Tuesday, after Modi’s remarks on the Ayodhya temple issue during an interview to news agency ANI, the RSS had welcomed the remarks and expressed hope that the government “fulfills the promise” in this tenure.  On the Supreme Court hearing of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit this Friday, VHP leader Kumar said, “There is very little possibility of a schedule of hearing being decided on January 4.”  Stating that the Ram Janmabhumi issue has been pending before courts for 69 years and it has been a “long wait”, Kumar said, “The matter is now listed on January 4, 2019, not before the appropriate bench, but again in the Chief’s Court.”  Asked whether the VHP will run any campaign against the BJP if the government fails to make a law on the Ayodhya temple, Kumar said “sants will decide the future course of action” for the VHP at a Dharma Sansad during the Kumbh in Prayagraj this month.  Maintaining that the Prime Minister has “reiterated his commitment” for the temple, the VHP leader said, “We want to tell him that waiting for a decision from the court will be eternal. The five-year term he has got, the government should enact a law in Parliament to make way for construction of a Ram temple in the same term.”  He said, “We liked the PM’s commitment for building the Ram temple, par jo adhyadeseh ke baare me unka timing hai… hum unko raai denge ki uss timing ko badlen aur adhyadesh ya kanoon…abhi lekar aayen (but the timing he has for the ordinance…we suggest he changes that and brings in an ordinance or legislation now).”  About a BJP MP’s suggestion that a private member Bill should be brought on the temple issue, the VHP leader said such a Bill cannot be a solution. “It cannot be a symbolic act. It has to be a substantive work, and that will be possible when the government brings in the Bill,” he said.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Day after PM Modi interview: Govt should bring in ordinance on Ram temple now, says VHP", "tags": "narendra modi, modi interview, modi on ram temple, ram temple, ayodhya ram temple, ram mandir, rss, vhp, vhp on ram temple, ayodhya rss, narendra modi, supreme court, law on ram mandir, india news, indian express", "categories": "", "author": "Lalmani Verma", "sitename": "The Indian Express", "image_url": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/12/VHP-7.jpg?w=759", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9602977633476257, "responded_url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/day-after-pm-modi-interview-govt-should-bring-in-ordinance-on-ram-temple-now-says-vhp-5520838/", "publisher": "indianexpress.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T23:21:03+00:00"}

He was 20 years old.  His family confirmed the death to The Indianapolis Star .  Trent wanted to be a sportswriter and was determined to attend Purdue despite suffering three bouts with a rare bone cancer, first diagnosed at age 15. He entered Purdue in the fall of 2017 while undergoing chemotherapy. He camped out with another student to get good seats to a Purdue-Michigan football game, just hours after chemotherapy.  He gained national attention in 2018 by becoming the adopted captain of the Boilermakers football team. He was in a wheelchair for Purdue's upset win over Ohio State, which was ranked No. 2 in the nation at the time.  He became a social media star with his positive attitude and determination to live every day to the fullest despite the illness.  \"Though I am in hospice care and have to wake up every morning knowing that the day might be my last, I still have a choice to make: to make that day the best it can be,\" Trent wrote in a guest column for the newspaper in early December.

I am amazed at how trash-laden our highways are. There is a theory that leaving graffiti begets more graffiti, so there is a rush to paint over graffiti. Maybe the same is true for leaving trash on the highway. It signals a lack of care and the OK to throw out more trash. The ramps are especially polluted with trash. A related concern is control of weeds which have become part of the landscaping and the trash easily gets wrapped into the weeds.  It is a sad state to look at day after day. Have people become blind to the state of the highway surroundings? I hope I am not the lone voice of concern.  Donna Goldman, Saratoga  A: Mercy, you are not. And thanks to the NCAA football title game coming to Levi Stadium on Monday, Caltrans is sprucing up the area assigning extra work crews this week to collect trash along Highway 87 from Interstate 280 to Mineta International Airport, including ramps.  Q: Driving south on Interstate 280 toward Highway 101 is most depressing. One sees tent after tent and campsites at the exits. Before you see the tents what catches your eye is the sea of litter strewn downhill from the location. I know these are human beings attempting to survive as best as possible, but why do they have to litter? I don’t know the solution, but I know that the litter in our area has gotten worse from these impromptu roadside campers.  Andrea Thomas, Los Gatos  A: Loui-the-Adopt-A-Highway-Person will have her volunteers out Saturday on 280 between Meridian and Saratoga avenues. If you are planning to attend, go to www.louitucker.com/ for more information. They meet at the northwest corner of Leigh and Moorpark avenues.  Q: I travel 280/237 frequently and am shocked by the amount of trash I see across from San Jose City College. The contents don’t appear to be what you’d expect by someone throwing something out the window (kiddie pools, Tupperware, a commercial broom, and boxes). What’s going on here? Jen McGuigan, Los Altos  A: State Senator Jim Beall, D-San Jose, has helped to secure more than $10.2 million to clean up the South Bay’s worst looking interchanges. Caltrans expends an average of $67 million per year statewide picking up trash from our highways. The problem has worsened due to a combination of steadily increasing traffic, which means more litter, and a rise in the illegal encampments that produce substantial amounts of refuse. Caltrans is hiring additional maintenance workers, but litter remains a chronic problem.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "NCAA football title game prompts cleanup along Highway 87: Roadshow", "tags": "Litter, Caltrans.

He said the people in the state should look at PKR and DAP’s political struggle and not where they are from.  “They should look at whether PKR and DAP are fighting for the people and whether they are sincere,” he said in an interview with Sayed Munawar Sayed Mustar on RTM1.  Baru, who is also the Works Minister, said PKR has gradually been accepted by the Sarawakians over the last 10 years.  “The acceptance is encouraging since I won in the 2011 state election in Ba’Kelalan, together with See Chee How (Batu Lintang) and Ali Biju (Krian),” he said.  Baru said Sarawak DAP has also won seats in the 2011 state election.  “In the 2016 state election, we and our colleagues from the DAP managed to retain our state seats,” he said, adding that this shows that the struggles of the two PH parties have been accepted by Sarawakians.  He said the struggles of PKR and DAP were again accepted by Sarawakians when they won 10 parliamentary seats in the last general elections.  Baru said two Independents who won in GE14 also joined PKR, boosting the total number of seats for PH in Sarawak to 12.  He said the core issue which PKR has been fighting for over the years is the Native Customary Rights (NCR) lands.  He said this issue is close to the hearts of not just the Dayaks, but also the Malays and Kedayans.  “As a lawyer, I have been fighting many NCR land cases in court and won a number of them.”  Baru, who is also the Selangau federal lawmaker, believes that PKR won four rural seats in GE14 because of the NCR land issue.  He slammed the ruling Gabungan Party Sarawak (GPS) for its half-hearted effort to amend the Sarawak Land Code relating to NCR lands last year.  He said the amendment did not take into account the decisions of the Federal Court relating to the definitions of territorial domain and communal forest reserves which the natives claimed as their NCR land.  He said the GPS government needs to be changed and the best opportunity would be during the 2021 state election.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Baru Bian: Don’t look at PKR and DAP as outside parties | Malay Mail", "tags": "sarawak, baru bian, sarawak pkr", "categories": "Malaysia", "author": "Published", "sitename": "Malay Mail", "image_url": "https://media.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2018/2018-10/20181031YM15_Parliament-seo.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9786867499351501, "responded_url": "https://www.malaymail.com/s/1708526/baru-bian-dont-look-at-pkr-and-dap-as-outside-parties", "publisher": "malaymail.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102150606-00065.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T17:09:01+00:00"}

Former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro is expected to formally launch his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination Jan. 12 in his hometown. Castro, who also served as secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration, stopped short of making his bid official in a media advisory Wednesday, just as he did Dec. 12 when he declared that he was establishing an exploratory committee in advance of a campaign. However, his twin brother, U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio, dropped all pretense during a joint appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\" \"I'll speak on his behalf. He's going to run for president,\" Joaquin Castro said in response to prodding from the late-night comedian. \"For the FEC lawyers — he didn't say it. I said it.\" Closer to home, Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of El Paso has said he hasn't ruled out a run for the presidency. O'Rourke received national acclaim and support during his unsuccessful campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. O'Rourke, who leaves office Thursday, has not laid out a timetable for reaching a decision. Julian Castro's expected entrance into the 2020 presidential sweepstakes comes just days after Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts unveiled her own plans for a national campaign. Others, including former Vice President Joe Biden and New Jersey U.S. Sen, Cory Booker, also are said to be considering a run for the Democratic nomination. Julian Castro, 44, has not run for office outside of San Antonio. But in a four-minute YouTube speech last month, he offered a preview of themes he might employ in what could be a long slog for the nomination. \"Growing up in Texas, America wasn't just my home, my country, it was also a promise,\" he said. \"A promise that my family could have a better life. My grandmother, Victoria, came here when she was just 7 years old. She never made it past the fourth grade, but she taught her family the value of hard work.\" Since leaving the Obama Cabinet, Castro has established a political action committee called Opportunity First to help elect left-of-center candidates.

All of the movies featuring Harrison Ford as the archaeologist and adventurer just recently hit Netflix, but if you don’t have time to sit and watch them, maybe this incredible Indiana Jones LEGO creation that took over 300 hours to build will hold you over for the time being.  Master builder Caleb Watson built an incredible Raiders of the Lost Ark LEGO diorama that recreates the opening scene where Indiana Jones retrieves the Fertility Idol that is kept safe by a series of traps. It’s 8-feet long, contains moving LEGO minifigures, and even has some Easter eggs referencing the other Indiana Jones movies and a certain Star Wars movie too. Check out the Indiana Jones LEGO diorama below.  Indiana Jones LEGO Diorama  Caleb Watson took this creation to the LEGO convention BrickCon a few months ago, and it won an honorable mention for Best of Show. And while it took 300 hours to build, he had to put some extra work in during the convention itself, because the motion effects that required gears to move pieces could only last so long. Watson told The Brothers Brick:   “When you run LEGO mechanisms long enough with significant load, the pieces start to give out. Every day at Brickcon after the show, I had to replace a large number of the gears in some of the mechanisms because the teeth were bending over, and underneath other connections were piles of plastic ABS dust from pieces rubbing next to each other all day.” This is easily one of the coolest LEGO creations we’ve ever seen.

{"requested_url": "https://nationalpost.com/pmn/sports-pmn/solskjaer-retains-magic-touch-at-man-united-with-another-win", "plain_text": "MANCHESTER, England — With Manchester United still scoreless after an hour at Newcastle, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was facing the first real challenge of his interim tenure at England’s biggest club. His response showed he might just have the same magic touch as a United manager that he had as a player. Solskjaer sent on Romelu Lukaku as part of a double substitution in the 63rd minute and, 38 seconds later, the striker scored with his first touch to set United on its way to a 2-0 win at St. James’ Park on Wednesday. That’s four straight victories for Solskjaer since replacing Jose Mourinho last month — among previous United managers, only the great Matt Busby achieved that feat in their first four matches — and 14 goals scored. “It’s totally different with the new manager,” Lukaku said. “We are all learning from him. So far so good.” Even better for United, fourth-place Chelsea could only draw 0-0 at home to Southampton at Stamford Bridge to leave only six points between the teams in the race for a top-four finish and Champions League qualification. United moved to within three points of fifth-place Arsenal, too. The team has truly been revived by its former striker. RASHFORD SCORES AGAIN One of Solskjaer’s biggest successes has been getting the best out of young United striker Marcus Rashford, who added the second goal against Newcastle in the 80th minute to make it three in four games under the new coach. Rashford also fired in the free kick that was spilled by Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, allowing Lukaku to tap in. “Marcus Rashford has the Cristiano hit — it swerves everywhere,” Solskjaer said, comparing the striker’s dead-ball technique to Cristiano Ronaldo’s, “but I liked his goal today. Calmed himself down, just passed it in. Well done. “He is only 21, you have to remember that.” Solskjaer came through his toughest test so far at United and the following league game is yet another step up. A trip to Wembley Stadium for a match against third-place Tottenham is next up for United on Jan. 13. IMPOTENT CHELSEA Chelsea is running out of fit forwards and it is starting to show. Three days after needing a goal from central midfielder N’Golo Kante to eke out a 1-0 win at Crystal Palace, Chelsea lacked a cutting edge in attack as it toiled to a draw against a Southampton side battling to avoid relegation. With striker Olivier Giroud and wingers Pedro Rodriguez and Callum Hudson-Odoi currently on the sidelines, Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri saw Willian hobble off injured in the first half at Stamford Bridge. Top scorer Eden Hazard was Chelsea’s biggest threat once again, but he cannot keep bailing the team out. “I think we played well for 80 metres, then in the last 20 metres we were in trouble,” Sarri said. “We had four or five goal opportunities but sometimes if you want to have a lot of opportunities you have to score the first goal.” “On the bench I only had one offensive player in Loftus (Ruben Loftus-Cheek),” Sarri said, “and he is not very well at the moment with back trouble.” GOALS GALORE Watford and Bournemouth scored six goals between them in a 26-minute span in the first half as the two mid-table teams played out a 3-3 draw. Ryan Fraser had the final say as Bournemouth came from two goals down to rescue a point. In the night’s other entertaining match, West Ham and Brighton shared four goals in 12 second-half minutes in their 2-2 draw. Back from injury, Marko Arnautovic scored both goals for West Ham, which was 2-0 down at one stage. HUDDERSFIELD STRANDED Huddersfield squandered a lead to lose 2-1 to Burnley and sits eight points adrift of safety after 21 games. Burnley moved out of the relegation zone. Crystal Palace won 2-0 at Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to second-half goals by Jordan Ayew and Luka Milivojevic. —— —— Steve Douglas is at http://www.twitter.com/sdouglas80", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Solskjaer retains magic touch at Man United with another win", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "The Associated Press", "sitename": "National Post", "image_url": "https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/LNDD203-AP.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9648207426071167, "responded_url": "https://nationalpost.com/pmn/sports-pmn/solskjaer-retains-magic-touch-at-man-united-with-another-win", "publisher": "nationalpost.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T23:41:38+00:00"}

A new study is connecting the rise of online dating to an increase in interracial marriages and marriages that last longer. A New Zealand woman who hit headlines around the world for marrying her husband on their first date has reportedly been fired after the love story went viral. Sarah Elliott, 34, married Paul Edwards, 36, on Christmas Day after meeting for the first time at Las Vegas airport in their wedding outfits. The pair had matched on dating app Bumble just days earlier, but decided to get hitched after realising they “got on so well”. Despite admitting the idea was “crazy” the UK-based lovebirds booked a chapel in Vegas and tied the knot not long after touching down. It didn’t take long for their unusual romance to go viral, causing an X-rated photo of Sarah to emerge which reportedly led to her being fired from her nanny job,The Sunreports. “Her boss didn’t like the kind of attention she was getting and has decided it best she work elsewhere,” a source said. “She was looking for love, and was very lucky to find it, but now she’ll be getting back online for a new job.” The bride has since admitted she went to a fetish party on a date with a man she met online, just weeks before she eloped with Paul. However Paul isn’t deterred by his wife’s racy past, admitting during an appearance on Good Morning Britain that he’d already seen the photo. “I already knew her likes and dislikes. There wasn’t anything we hid from each other. It wasn’t a surprise to me,” he told the TV hosts. “We’ve been completely open about literally everything,” Sarah said. Inspired by Married At First Sight, the pair went the whole hog for their impromptu wedding, with Paul even getting down on one knee at the airport and presenting his bride with an engagement ring. The newlyweds are now looking forward to married life, confessing they’ve become “inseparable” since their spur-of-the-moment nuptials. Dad-of-two Paul has two teenagers from a previous relationship who have recently met their new stepmum and are said to “adore” her. Meanwhile, Sarah still lives with her ex-husband as they’ve yet to sell the home they own together.

George Clooney and Hugh Laurie will lead a cast that also includes Kyle Chandler, Christopher Abbott and Martin Delaney. Channel 4 and Hulu have yet to drop a Catch-22 trailer, though the latter has released first-look images from the series. When is Catch-22 on Hulu out? The release date for Catch-22 is not yet known, as neither Hulu nor Channel 4 have said when the series will air in the US and UK. Per the Hollywood Reporter, however, the series will start in spring 2019 on Hulu. The series, however, may not come to Channel 4 until summer, as they tend to air series that originally streamed on Hulu a few months after they are first broadcast. For example, Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale season two started in August on Channel 4 after first airing in April on Hulu. Who is in the cast of Catch-22 on Hulu? Leading the Catch-22 cast as the book’s protagonist Yossarian is Christopher Abbott, best known as Marnie’s (played by Allison Williams) boyfriend Charlie in Girls. George Clooney, who is producing the series with his partner Grant Heslov, will star in the series as training officer Scheisskopf after reportedly giving up the bigger role of Colonel Cathcart due to a busy of a work schedule. Friday Night Light’s Kyle Chandler instead will play Colonel Cathcart, the central antagonist of the book. The Night Manager’s Hugh Laurie is also in the Catch-22 cast as Major de Coverley, a character so fierce that no one dares to ask his first name. What will happen in Catch-22? The official synopsis for the series from Hulu reads: “Catch-22 is the story of the incomparable, artful dodger, Yossarian, a US Air Force bombardier in World War II who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. “But his real problem is not the enemy, but rather his own army which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. “Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to avoid his military assignments, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule which specifies that a concern for one’s own safety in the face of dangers which are real and immediate is the process of a rational mind. “A man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but a request to be removed from duty is evidence of sanity and therefore makes him ineligible to be relieved from duty.” The series is based on the cult 1961 novel by Joseph Heller, which was turned into a film with an all-star cast in 1970. Is there a trailer for Catch-22? Neither Channel 4 nor Hulu have released a promo for Catch-22. However, in December Hulu released a series of nine images from the series. These show a number of images that will be familiar to fans of the book, like Cathcart travelling in a truck piled high with plum tomatoes.

{"requested_url": "https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/01/02/river-north-bottled-blonde-liquor-license/", "plain_text": "CHICAGO (CBS)–Loud music, scantily-clad partygoers and piles of vomit often fill the sidewalks on the 500 block of North Wells in Chicago’s River North neighborhood on Friday and Saturday nights.  Neighbors of the controversial Bottled Blonde, with the backing of 42nd Ward Alderman Brendan Reilly, want the establishment shut down. They say the chaotic scenes that play out near the bar each weekend have become a calamity.  Residents of the upscale neighborhood have been engaged in a battle with the bar since 2017 when complaints started piling up high enough to prompt the city to move to attempt to revoke Bottled Blonde’s liquor license.  The city’s Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection issued an order to revoke the license, but an appeal filed by Bottled Blonde’s attorneys is still being considered, and a judge is allowing it to stay open in the meantime.  Ald. Reilly described Cook County Judge Neil Cohen’s decision to allow the bar to stay open as “disappointing.”  “I am extremely disappointed that the business has been afforded the ability to remain open and continue to draw out this frustrating process,” Reilly wrote in a Dec. 13 letter mailed to River North residents.  In the letter, Reilly also encouraged residents to call 911 if they observe any illegal and/or unsafe activity outside of the bar before the next court hearing on Jan. 14.  One point of contention in the city’s battle against Bottled Blonde was whether the establishment serves enough food to maintain a liquor license classification as a restaurant and not a club. The city claims most of the business’s profits come from liquor instead of food, the Sun-Times reports.  Judge Cohen ordered Bottled Blonde’s owners to hand over seven months of revenue records showing a breakdown of food and alcohol sales by Dec. 19, but that hearing was continued to later this month.  Bottled Blonde recently has been going the extra mile to push its food offerings, using social media to brand itself as a “pizza place” and offering a $10 burger and beer special.  The establishment has also been using the #businessasusual hashtag in most of its posts, perhaps to remind followers who are aware of the business’s contentious situation that they’re still open for business.", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Future Of River North Bar Bottled Blonde Still Uncertain", "tags": "vibNews", "categories": "", "author": null, "sitename": "CBS Chicago", "image_url": "https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/bottled.jpg?w=625", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9637397527694702, "responded_url": "https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/01/02/river-north-bottled-blonde-liquor-license/", "publisher": "chicago.cbslocal.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102204045-00067.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T23:45:12+00:00"}

Routes on some of Cumbria’s most picturesque walks have been attacked by vandals who sawed the gates from their hinges and dumped them, with some ending up in waterways and others disappearing altogether.  The first missing gates were noted in November, when the majority were targeted, but the vandalism continued over Christmas in areas around Rydal and Grasmere.  Now fans of the Lake District and walkers on Facebook are calling for cameras to be installed to catch the perpetrators.  Gary Thompson said: “Small remote battery operated cameras would do the trick, you can even get motion sensor ones - just get about five of them - park rangers could set them up at different locations.  “Pathetic that you would have to do this.”  James Birkinshaw added: “Replace the gates and put animal tracker cameras up and catch them out. [There is] far too much of this thing going on and spoiling the hard work what people are doing”.  As well as skewing walk routes and spoiling the waterways, the vandalism is hindering farmers - one can no longer let his sheep graze on Loughriff Fell, where it acted as a barrier to the busy A591.  Dave Almond, National Trust manager for Grasmere said: “We have lost one gate from our land near Grasmere which is having a direct impact on one of our tenants who is currently unable to graze his stock in the usual places. So far we have heard nothing to indicate why this is happening.”  Lake District rangers and the National Trust are urging the public for information after the UNESCO World Heritage Site has suffered ongoing issues since mid-November.  Lake District National Park Authority (LDNPA) ranger David Switzer said that the first instances were \"very, very peculiar\" and that they were \"really at a loss\".  \"We managed to fish those out and reinstate them and we thought maybe this was a one-off incident,\" Mr Switzer said.  He told The Daily Telegraph: “We've had a number of attacks to gates and fingerposts at White Moss over the last two months.  “The vandalism has continued over the Christmas period with footpath fingerposts ripped out and the police warning signs removed.  “We urge anyone with information to please contact us or the police.”", "published_date": "2019-01-02", "title": "Lake District walkers demand CCTV after dozens of gates are hacked off", "tags": "Cumbria,News,Standard,Lake District,National Trust", "categories": "", "author": "Laura FitzPatrick", "sitename": "The Telegraph", "image_url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/02/TELEMMGLPICT000184617760-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_01geUMvhhqXYj_tJM1bT7UwhijdleV4Rn3Ji5oHK4A.jpeg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9790568351745605, "responded_url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/02/lake-district-walkers-demand-cctv-dozens-gates-hacked/", "publisher": "telegraph.co.uk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190102150606-00065.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-02T17:27:51+00:00"}

(TSXV: SGZ) (\"Sego\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce exploration results from its Phase-2 2018 diamond drilling and trenching programme completed in December, 2018 at the Company's Miner Mountain project. Sego is 100% owner of the Miner Mountain project, an alkalic copper-gold porphyry exploration project located near Princeton, British Columbia (See Attached Map). In the Phase-2 2018 Programme, Sego drilled 1100 metres with 5 drill holes. Split core samples have been sent to the laboratory, MS Analytical, in Langley, BC. The Company expects to have assays available in early 2019. Drilling was designed to extend and define the Cuba Zone. In addition, Sego excavated 100 meters of trenching during the programme, and exposed a new important zone approximately 500 metres west of the Cuba Zone. This zone was originally defined on combined soil and geophysical anomalies. Trenches uncovered roughly 100 metres of extensive alteration and copper mineralization, including malachite, azurite, and chalcopyrite. A percussion drill hole located southwest of the new zone had previously assayed 0.2% copper and 0.1 grams/tonne gold over hole length of 56 metres. Trench samples from this zone are at MS Analytical in Langley, BC, and results are pending. The programme was developed as the beginning of a much larger scale exploration programme designed to expand and enhance mineralization at Sego's Miner Mountain Project. A mapping study by Ron Britten, PhD., P.Eng., has indicated that the target areas are a confluence of multiple overlapping features consistent with copper-gold alkaline porphyry in British Columbia. The results of the Phase-2 2018 drilling programme will be used to target the next round of exploration expected to start in early 2019. The Company's geologists are currently studying the entire Cuba Zone and the new discovery zone in detail. J Paul Stevenson, CEO, stated: \"The drilling in Phase-2 2018 Programme, combined with previous exploration data and drilling, to date, has unquestionably revealed the existence of a new zone on the west side of the property and has greatly expanded the Cuba Zone. Utilizing the data and exploration from the 2018 programme, Sego is planning to explore more of our targets in the next year.\" This news release was reviewed and approved by Selina Tribe, Ph.D., P.Geo., a Qualified Person under NI 43-101. Sego is 100% owner of the Miner Mountain project, an alkalic copper-gold porphyry exploration project near Princeton, British Columbia. The property is 2,056 hectares in size and is located 15 kilometres north of the Copper Mountain Mine operated by Copper Mountain Mining Corporation and Mitsubishi Copper. Sego has a Memorandum of Understanding with the Upper Similkameen Indian Band on whose Traditional Territory the Miner Mountain project is situated. Sego has received an Award of Excellence for its reclamation work at Miner Mountain. J.

The site claims that Apple has invested a \"significant amount\" in Sharp's factories to enable them to produce IGZO displays, which will allow the device to be thinner and offer better battery life. Jeffries analyst Peter Misek said: \"IGZO technology is perfect in that it offers near-OLED power consumption while having a lower cost and thinness that is only 25% greater than OLED, based on our checks.\" Meanwhile macotakara.jp also reckons a Taiwanese company (as yet unspecified) is working on LCD screens for Apple for a \"fundamentally changed\" iPad 4.

He disclosed that a high-powered delegation from Etisalat has recently met Prime Minister Imran Khan and shown its eagerness to close the deal. “Another meeting with the Etisalat management is due later this month,” the official added.  Etisalat delayed the payment after Pakistan failed to transfer all PTCL properties under the agreement.  Mr Malik informed the committee that PTCL’s asset management wing had provided inaccurate and fundamentally flawed records on its properties as it owned only 3,248 properties but had mentioned 3,384 in the privatisation agreement finalised in 2006.  The government, which has 62 per cent stake in PTCL on Nov 15, 2018, has provided the list of all 3,248 properties to Etisalat with details why the remaining 33 properties could not be transferred to PTCL, said Mr Malik.  “While Etisalat paid $1.4 billion upfront, it stopped the remaining instalments amounting to $800m until the status of all the properties was cleared, which has remained a bone of contention for the last 12 years,” the official said.  The committee was informed that the properties could not be transferred to Etisalat because they were either partially owned, rented out, owned by provinces but occupied by the federal government, or were not owned by the company in the first place.  Responding to a question, the official explained that the remaining 33 properties – which cannot be transferred to PTCL – had been evaluated at market price and the information was conveyed to Etisalat.  “In the past Etisalat had also been requested to do the same. The purpose was to adjust the price of the remaining properties against the outstanding payment from Etisalat. Nonetheless, the UAE-based company has finally agreed to discuss the status of properties,” the official remarked.  Rizwan Malik said that the government must take steps to settle the issues related to the privatisation of PTCL as well as K-Electric. “Solving the problems surrounding these two companies will help restore confidence of foreign investors and create a positive impression of Pakistan in the international market as a suitable place for conducting business,” the official said.

About a dozen of the 26 employees at the Lavern Heideman and Sons Limited mill were on site at when the fire broke out around 8 p.m. By the time the Pembroke Fire Department arrived, a large portion of the main mill building and hopper were engulfed in flames and the fire eventually spread to and levelled an adjacent building housing lumber. “We are very grateful to the fire departments, police, paramedics and all first responders. We are especially relieved that there were no injuries to employees or emergency personnel,” company president Eddie Heideman said in a news release Thursday afternoon. “We are looking at all options to ensure that our employees continue to work and that our customers’ needs are met,” vice-president Kris Heideman added in the release. When part of the first building collapsed, it took down a supply line from Hydro One to the Ottawa River Power Corporation and a number of insulators plunging the city of Pembroke into darkness. The glow of the fire could be seen in the sky as a result of power outage, which lasted 10 hours. Because of the scale of the fire and damage estimated to be in the millions of dollars, an investigator from the Office of the Fire Marshal arrived Thursday afternoon to conduct interviews and examine the scene to try to determine a cause of the blaze. Jane Donnelly, ORPC general manager, said it was a long, cold night for the crews tasked with restoring the high voltage lines which provide electricity to all of Pembroke and the Sandy Beach area through Hydro One. There was initially a delay in the repair process until the site could be deemed safe. She noted the fire was directly under one of the conductors. About 10 members of the ORPC were dealing with the incident, including six crew members in the field, one in the operations control centre, IT department, engineer and Donnelly herself. Electricity was restored to customers in Pembroke by 6:30 a.m. Crews continued working in the area on Thursday and Donnelly noted there are still additional repairs required, including an electrical pole in the middle of the fire area that will be checked to ensure it is in a safe condition. “The response was excellent with our fire department working with the OPP and paramedics and also Laurentian Valley coming to help us was fabulous,” said Pembroke Mayor Michael LeMay, who revisited the site Thursday afternoon. “I think they did everything they could do. We know big difficulty was the power outage, (it) did take time because (they) couldn’t get in to do the work and had to wait.” The Pembroke Fire Department sent extensive apparatus and 30 personnel, who were hindered by winds that forced firefighters to shift positions. The Laurentian Valley Fire Department also responded to the scene with a tanker and covered other calls in the city as the PFD continued to battle the blaze. Members of the Upper Ottawa Valley detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police and County of Renfrew Paramedic Service also responded to the scene.

Mr Shanahan said Cork - along with Limerick and Sligo - has benefitted from the IDA's attempts to move technology investment \"into the regions\" and remains \"an attractive and very credible proposition\" as a base for both tech and pharmaceutical firms.

Nearly 60% of IDA-supported jobs are now based outside of Dublin; a record high. Mr Shanahan said strong investment in Dublin and the regions, as opposed to one over the other, is needed in order for Ireland to be doing well.

{"requested_url": "https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-ravens-red-lipstick-review-20190103-htmlstory.html", "plain_text": "An elongated, lumpy form seems suspended, like a flayed body twisting in the wind. One fears to find a head dangling at its tip, but the form ends in a gnarled, blackened mass instead. “Nagasaki, Bottle Melted and Deformed” was taken by Japanese photographer Tomatsu Shomei in 1961. It is both a document and a metaphor for an atomic atrocity most Americans can’t begin to comprehend. It’s the type of image one expects to find in Lena Fritsch’s copiously illustrated “Ravens & Red Lipstick: Japanese Photography Since 1945.” A broad survey for Western audiences, the book also dips into less familiar territory. Both neophytes and those familiar with Japanese photography are likely to discover something unexpected. “Ravens” includes many still life, landscape, conceptual and abstract works by the likes of Sugimoto Hiroshi, Kawauchi Rinko, Ishiuchi Miyako and others. (Fritsch respects traditional Japanese name order, last name first, throughout.) But I found myself paying particular attention to images of the body. This may reflect Fritsch’s biases: she is also the author of “The Body as a Screen: Japanese Art Photography of the 1990s.” It also likely reflects my own perspective as a Japanese American raised with a paucity of images of Asians. In suburban California in the 1970s and ’80s, Asian people appeared only occasionally in the media, and when they did (with the exception of Connie Chung), they were usually sexpots, war casualties, effeminate villains or bumbling foreigners. When you don’t see yourself in culture, you feel unimportant, then angry. Things have improved a little since then, but I am always on guard for any whiff of stereotype. Araki Nobuyoshi, \"untitled,\" 1971, \"Sentimental Journey\" series Araki Nobuyoshi / Yoshiko Isshiki Office, Tokyo When you don’t see yourself in culture, you feel unimportant, then angry. Tanuma Takeyoshi, \"Dancers resting on the rooftop of the SKD Theatre,\" 1949. Tanuma Takeyoshi So I raise an eyebrow when confronted with a book like “Ravens,” in which a Western author purports to represent Japanese culture, and by extension, people. Fritsch is curator of modern and contemporary art at Oxford University’s Ashmolean Museum, a Japanese photography specialist, and a translator, but her effort comes on the heels of many egregious misrepresentations. I much appreciated her reflections on her relationship to Japanese culture, which she describes as shifting between a “‘Western’ distant position, and a ‘Japanese’ proximal perspective.” And she is careful to set “Ravens” apart from earlier publications that made overly simplistic assumptions. One author asserted that because they take their shoes off indoors, Japanese people have a “more natural relationship with the feet.” (Insert eye-roll here.) Although her references to Japanese history are often glancing, Fritsch situates her subjects within actual historical and social movements rather than reductive Western imaginings. That effort should not be remarkable, but it is. Hosoe Eikoh, \"Ordeal by Roses (Barakei) #6,\" 1961 Hosoe Eikoh / Akio Nagasawa Gallery/Publishing, Tokyo Yoneda Tomoko, \"Lovers, Dunaújváros (formerly Stalin City),\" Hungary, 2004, \"After the Thaw\" series Yoneda Tomoko Fritsch’s in-between position is reflected in the book’s design, which intersperses her informative, accessible history with transcriptions of 25 interviews she conducted with many of the artists. This approach allows their voices to percolate throughout, presenting varied, personal points of view. I am heartened by this mixture, and by Fritsch’s acknowledgement of her own position as a proximal outsider. The book not only provides rich, multivalent context for its arresting images, but also hope for more nuanced understandings of traditions not our own. “Ravens” begins in the post-WWII period, in which photography served primarily as a documentary medium, recording the devastation of the war as well as the resilience of survivors. Hayashi Tadahiko’s “Orphaned street children smoking” from 1946 is a heartbreaker. Two dirty children sit on the pavement. One smokes a cigarette, the other is clothed only in a tattered breechcloth. By contrast, Domon Ken’s “Mr. and Mrs. Kotani: Survivors of the Atomic Bomb” from 1957 depicts parents and a chubby baby, smiling widely despite the scars that dapple Mr. Kotani’s face. Such images reflect a desire to look unflinchingly, but with deep humanity, at the traumas of war — the physical destruction, the abject poverty, the rending of social and familial ties — and especially the unprecedented effects of the atomic bombs. They’re a far cry from the prim studio portraiture that dominated prewar Japanese photography. Takano Ryūdai, \"Long hair nesting on a pink cloth, 2002,\" \"In My Room\" series Takano Ryūdai / Yumiko Chiba Associates, Tokyo In the 1960s and ’70s, more expressive and subjective approaches emerged, most visible in the West through the work of Moriyama Daido and Araki Nobuyoshi. These photographers’ gritty, dynamic visions arose amid widespread upheavals and protests against the ongoing U.S. military presence in Japan. They were also influenced by Western photographers like William Klein who used unusual angles and out-of-focus shots to document city life. Like Araki, Fukase Masahisa used photography in a diaristic way, often photographing his wife, Yoko, on a daily basis. When they divorced, lonesome black ravens became his dominant motif. Identifying with the stark desolation that the birds evoked, Fukase wrote that he had “become a raven with a camera.” Other artists mined Japanese folk traditions less legible in the West. Naito Masatoshi’s “Grandma Explosion (Baba Bakuhatsu)” from 1969 is an eerily surreal depiction of elderly female shamans performing a nighttime ritual dance. From there, the book jumps ahead to 1990s “Girls’ Photography,” which emerged at the nexus of photo booth snapshots and kawaii (“cute”) culture à la Hello Kitty. As photographic technology became more accessible, young women used the medium to define themselves in the face of the male-dominated Japanese photography scene. Izima Kaoru, \"Otsuka Nene wears Tuzigahana #214,\" 1999, Landscapes with a Corpse series. Izima Kaoru Still, this effort cut both ways. “Girls’ Photography” practitioners were sought after as models and entertainment figures, but this popularity made them seem more like a marketing trend than a serious artistic movement. Nagashima Yurie’s edgy self-portraits kick against this tendency. “Self-Portrait (Family #26)” from 1993 depicts her family of four in their living room in a traditional portrait pose — mother and father seated in front, children kneeling behind — all of them naked. The work is both an irreverent reworking of the family portrait and a feminist gesture that presents the body for what it is rather than for the (typically male) desires projected upon it. Works like this aligned with the girl power and riot grrrl movements that emerged internationally in the 1990s. The final chapter is titled simply “Contemporary Japanese Photography” and reflects trends as varied as those found globally. One standout is Takano Ryudai’s portrait of a winsome, only partially clothed young man from 2001. The sexually charged image not only upends the dominance of the female nude, but harks back to wakashu, the faded Japanese artistic tradition of beautiful male figures, desirable to both women and men. In his interview, Takano relates how, prior to Western incursions, there was no difference between heterosexual and homosexual love in Japan. His work brings renewed attention to the male body as an object of sexual desire, reflected in the increased popularity of grooming and fashion among Japanese men in the early 2000s. However, due to a Japanese Penal Code that dates from 1907, he has often had to censor his work, cutting or covering areas where a penis is visible. Ninagawa Mika, \"Liquid Dreams,\" 2003 Ninagawa Mika / Tomio Koyama Gallery, Tokyo “Ravens” is refreshing because it allows these subtleties of ideation and reception to bubble up, even in a book that covers over 70 years of photography. This is due to Fritsch’s even-handed approach, one that allows for other voices and resists centering itself. I’m sure there are experts who will quibble with her choices — some artists, like Morimura Yasumasa, already much discussed in the West, receive more attention than others — but the book gives me hope. In the realm of art, at least, perhaps we are moving toward a more respectful, circumspect discourse, where it might be possible to recognize oneself through the lens of another. “Ravens and Red Lipstick: Japanese Photography Since 1945” Thames and Hudson :: “Ravens and Red Lipstick: Japanese Photography Since 1945” Lena Fritsch Thames and Hudson: 288 pp., $50 - Sharon Mizota is an art critic and archivist whose writing appears regularly in the Los Angeles Times.

The striker enjoyed a spell in the side earlier in the season after joining on loan from Derby in late August but fell down the pecking order and has made just three starts in the last 12 games.

The Chinese community in Newcastle has a long and proud tradition in Newcastle, having flourished since the arrival of families from China in the early 1970s.  The North East Chinese Association, which is based at premises in Stowell Street, was first established in 1982 to assist the immigrant population and now acts as a custodian of the country's vibrant culture - one of the oldest in the world.  It uses such occasions as Chinese New Year to share its traditions, food and arts - from calligraphy to music - with the wider community, while the nearby Ceremonial Arch - funded with help from the Chinese community - is a focal point for the celebrations.  But what are these all about, what do animals have to do with them and what do they tell us about the coming year?  Here we answer the questions about this year's event, which will be marked from 11am on February 5.  What is the Chinese New Year 2019 animal and why is it an animal at all?  Chinese New Year lasts for about two weeks and is based on the lunar calendar so the date can change each year.  This year will be the year of the pig. That's because the Chinese calendar is based upon a 12-year zodiac cycle - a system used for around 2,000 years - and animals represent the years, possibly because zodiacs originally involved the worship of animals.  The cycle repeats itself and people can work out which animal marked the year of their birth so, for instance, the last year of the pig was 12 years ago: 2007.  Those born during the year of whatever animal applies, are said to take on some of its specific characteristics.  What does it mean if your year comes around?  It can be seen as a challenge. Many of the New Year celebrations involve symbols and tokens of luck to ward away any misfortune and red is seen as a lucky colour and is a big part of the festivities, featuring in everything from lanterns to the lion dance.  Tell us more about the year of the pig  The year of earth pig begins on February 5 and will last until January 24, 2020. The pig is the last animal in the zodiac.  The pig is (falsely) considered to be a rather unintelligent animal; one which enjoys sleeping and eating so has links to laziness. Its tardiness caused by over-sleeping is said to be behind the reason it is placed 12th in the zodiac.  But the pig is considered lucky in terms of wealth as it is linked also to affluence, as well as to a good personality and good behaviour.  The Travel China Guide website highlights the following as lucky signs for those born in the year of the pig - and one of them includes the North East as a lucky direction so that bodes well.  Lucky numbers: 2, 5, 8 Lucky colours: yellow, grey, brown, gold Lucky flowers: hydrangea, marguerite and pitcher plants, which are carnivorous plans such as the venus fly trap Lucky directions: North East and south east What other animals are there?  The other 11 animals are the rat; ox; tiger; dragon; rabbit; dog; snake; horse; goat; monkey and rooster.  If you don't know what animal you are, you can work out here.  According to the Chinese New Year website there is a legend about their placement in the zodiac. It says the Jade Emperor was choosing 12 animals to be his palace guards. A cat was keen to sign up and asked his neighbour, a rat, to help him but Rat forgot which is why they became sworn enemies.  So, Ox was first in the queue at the palace but the Rat secretly climbed onto his back and jumped in front. Tiger and Dragon were annoyed at this but had to settle behind the Ox.  The Rabbit raced the Dragon and beat him, which annoyed the Dog which then bit the Rabbit and was sent to the back as punishment.  The Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey and Rooster all fought amongst themselves for a place before the Pig arrived late once the fuss was over and had to take last position.  The site adds: \"Of course, this is only a story. Cats didn't even exist in China when zodiac animals first came about.\"", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "What is the Chinese New Year 2019 animal?", "tags": "Chinese New Year,Newcastle City Centre,Google;Chinese New Year;Newcastle City Centre;Google", "categories": "Family & Kids", "author": "Barbara Hodgson", "sitename": "Nechronicle", "image_url": "https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article10890451.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS82581665.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9789806604385376, "responded_url": "https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/what-chinese-new-year-2019-15624951", "publisher": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103142237-00072.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T14:51:50+00:00"}

{"requested_url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianweller/2019/01/03/five-ways-policies-can-impact-retirement-security-in-2019/", "plain_text": "It’s a new year and people’s worries about retirement security remain high. Policymakers at all levels can help or hinder retirement security in 2019. Much of people's concern over retirement stems from uncertainty about jobs at older ages since many people would like to work longer, either to remain productive or to supplement their small savings. Other worries center around savings, Social Security, high debt and rising health care costs.  Against this backdrop, policymakers can shape five economic trends in 2019: jobs, savings, Social Security, debt and health care. These policies will substantially help or hinder improvements in retirement security.  First, policymakers in Congress and the administration need to keep a close eye on the labor market. Continued labor market growth will be necessary to reduce retirement income inequality. Having a job allows people to save more. Older workers in particular may be able to offset limited retirement savings by working longer if more opportunities for good jobs exist.    The labor market indeed delivered some welcome news for older workers in 2018. The unemployment rate for workers from 55 years old and older fell below 3.0% in the fall of 2018, the lowest level since 2001. At the same time, the employed share of people in this age group rose to 39.0% in November 2018, its highest level since 1962.  Some groups of older workers, though, struggle more to find a job than others do. Unemployment rates are higher and employment opportunities scarcer for African-Americans and Latinos than for whites, for example. Further labor market expansion could help to shrink these gaps.  Second, a number of state policies could give workers more access to retirement savings. An expanding economy and labor market have not yet delivered on real retirement security for many American families. Many workers do not have retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). This is especially true for communities of color, those working for small employers and those with less education. States such as Oregon and California have started to implement state-sponsored retirement savings plans for those who don’t have access at their job. These efforts should gain some momentum in 2019.  Third, the new Congress may see the need for more attention for Social Security expansion proposals that could quickly counter insufficient retirement savings. Over the last few years, such proposals received less attention as Congress focused its energy on passing ineffective tax cuts for corporations and high-income individuals. In 2018, conservatives even used the resulting deficits to call for cuts to Social Security and Medicare – two programs that had nothing to do with the rapidly growing deficits. With a new majority in the House of Representatives and the 2020 presidential election getting under way early, momentum may swing again towards proposals to shore up modest Social Security benefits.  Fourth, higher interest rates could directly raise costs for many retirees. Calculations based on the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances show that most retirees – 60.3% in 2016 – owed some form of debt, including 33.7% who had a median outstanding credit card balance of $2,000 at the time. Higher interest rates will then worsen income inequality, mainly by raising costs on variable interest debt such as credit cards.  Fifth, health care costs could top overall inflation again. For the past few years, the efforts of the Affordable Care Act have helped to keep health care inflation near overall price increases. Last year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expected health care inflation to grow faster than other price increases. This could again happen in 2019. Higher health care costs could eat into people’s retirement income with higher health insurance premiums and more out of pocket spending.  Medicaid expansion in a number of states as a result of last year’s election could potentially offset faster health care inflation. Price increases for key services often tend to grow more slowly under Medicaid than private insurance. Better health insurance coverage could counter faster health care inflation for some households.  Many households still struggle to prepare for retirement. A stronger labor market, easier access to retirement savings, protections for Social Security and Medicare, modest interest rates and smaller health care cost inflation will all help to boost retirement income security. Policymakers at all levels have the opportunity to make this happen. This year will show whether they are up to the challenge.

I joined academia in 2007 after working full time in Washington, DC, think tanks for almost a decade. My research has focused on retirement is...

That means, like perennial plants that keep growing and blooming every year, we contribute regularly to the work of sustaining the beautiful parks that dot our community. I recently learned about another group, called by a similar name, that moves beyond the wonderful work of the Conservancy to a much broader use of the term. Western philosophers such as Aldous Huxley and Mortimer Adler have called the discussion of what constitutes the best life “The Great Conversation.” This conversation is “perennial,\" that is, ongoing and evolving. Perennialists believe that you should learn and pass along to your children and others around you those things that are of perennial or continuing importance to all people everywhere. Now that’s a pretty tall order, but after looking at a list of perennialists and reading a small sample of their ideas, it seemed like a natural thing to discuss in the first column of a new year! So, what is important for “all people everywhere”? In a phrase, it is how to live successfully. Of course, the devil is in the details, but perennialists assert that people everywhere agree on certain core principles handed down from generation to generation across all cultures and nations. Here are some of those core principles, drawn from a short article by Alexander Green in the December 2018 issue of the Oxford Communique. Everything worthwhile in life is created as a result of love and concern for others. Humanity is one great family. Our similarities are broad and deep, our differences are narrow and superficial. The Golden Rule, expressed in some way in every society, is the cornerstone of successful human interaction. The giving of time, money, support and encouragement is never detrimental to the giver. Character development, the path from self-absorption to caring and consciousness, is central to a successful life. Problems are life’s way of getting the best out of us. They are opportunities to grow. When I was early in my medical training, we began using what is called the problem-oriented medical record. I have always thought it was named incorrectly, it should be the opportunity-oriented medical record! It is important to nourish your mind with the thoughts of history’s wisest thinkers, recognizing that some of our wisest thinkers may not be far removed from us in time. They may, in fact, be our contemporaries. Courage and self-awareness are required to live fully. My late mentor and teacher, Hiram Curry, used to say that some doctors have 20 years of experience and some have one year of experience 20 times; meaning that without paying attention to how patients respond to their treatments and learning from these results, they just do the same thing: treating problems (or opportunities) the same way, year after year. If we don’t examine our lives, as Socrates said, our lives become “not worth living.” Develop the ability to reason accurately and independently, rather than accepting ideas based solely on authority or tradition. Exercise humility. If we are honest with ourselves, we have much to be humble about. Practice forgiveness. When we forgive others, we find that others forgive us and that we forgive ourselves. Moral development comes from strengthening our impulse control, prioritizing personal relationships and fostering social responsibility. Our lives are immeasurably enriched by expressing gratitude and generosity. Finally, one especially important for the aging amateur: Whenever we act, we are never just doing. We are always becoming. If you aren’t growing, you are diminishing. The beginning of the new year is a great time to reflect on where we are and where we are headed, perhaps by asking, “Am I becoming the kind of person I want to be?

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Hurling crude bombs and stones, fringe groups on Thursday rampaged through the streets of Kerala, fighting pitched battles with police and political rivals, leaving scores of people injured including three BJP workers in a knife attack, officials said.\n\n \n The dawn-to-dusk 'Hartal' called by Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an umbrella organisation of pro-Hindutva groups, and the Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP), to protest the entry of two women of reproductive age into the Sabarimala temple on Wednesday virtually brought the state down to its knees. \n Hordes of right-wing activists were on the streets soon after the shutdown began, placing burning tyres and granite blocks on the roads, bringing vehicular traffic to a halt at several places. \n The state was under siege as they attacked over 20 offices of the ruling CPI(M) and its other Left allies, and clashed with police, leaving at least 31 personnel injured. \n In Thrissur, three BJP activists were stabbed during a scuffle with workers of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of Popular Front of India, police said.

Hordes of right-wing activists were on the streets soon after the shutdown began, placing burning tyres and granite blocks on the roads, bringing vehicular traffic to a halt at several places. The state was under siege as they attacked over 20 offices of the ruling CPI(M) and its other Left allies, and clashed with police, leaving at least 31 personnel injured. In Thrissur, three BJP activists were stabbed during a scuffle with workers of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of Popular Front of India, police said.

The government, on its part, has been repeatedly insisting that the 3.3 per cent target will be met, come hell or high water. Affirming its commitment, it even cut down on its borrowing programme. But without expenditure cuts, that target is unlikely to be achieved, unless there’s a windfall from an unexpected quarter.  The monthly GST run-rate, excluding refunds, stood at an average Rs 89,600 crore in the first nine months of the current fiscal, lower than the required run-rate of over `1 lakh crore. Overall, there appears to be a shortfall of about `1 lakh crore in revenue, as a result of which Kotak Securities estimates that gross fiscal deficit will likely print at 3.5 per cent. This, even after incurring expenditure cuts.  Accounting for refunds, on a cash accounting basis, November collections would likely be about Rs 87,000 crore, implying a nine-month run-rate of Rs 89,600 crore. “The required run-rate for the rest of FY19 is now about Rs 1.5 lakh crore. In a more realistic (though still optimistic) scenario of (1) 1-5 per cent month-on-month increase in rest of FY19, (2) higher IGST allocation to the Centre and (3) distribution of unallocated compensation cess equally between Centre and states, the Centre’s shortfall would likely be about Rs 1 lakh crore,” Kotak said in a note.  Per estimates, for the first eight months, the fiscal deficit is already at 114.8 per cent of its budgeted target. Net tax receipts in eight months stood at Rs 7.32 lakh crore as against a full-year target of Rs 14.8 lakh crore (49.4 per cent of the budgeted target), while total spending stood at `16.1 lakh crore against the full-year target of `24.4 lakh crore (66 per cent of budgeted target).  “This implies that while the expenditure remained on course, subdued tax receipts were responsible for pushing up the deficit. There are limited chances of exceeding the divestment target with the government garnering Rs 33,800 crore till December 1, 2018, below its target of Rs 80,000 crore,” it said.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Without expenditure cuts, Centre likely to miss fiscal deficit target", "tags": "GST, Fiscal Deficit Target", "categories": "Business", "author": "Express News Service", "sitename": "The New Indian Express", "image_url": "http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2019/1/3/w600X390/Rupees_street_vendor_mumbai_file_reuters_photo.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9438057541847229, "responded_url": "http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2019/jan/03/without-expenditure-cuts-centre-likely-to-miss-fiscal-deficit-target-1919852.html", "publisher": "newindianexpress.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103083914-00070.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T11:32:05+00:00"}

Erin Darr was arrested on suspicion of child abuse a few days before Christmas, and it’s not the first time she’s been under investigation. When the 11-year-old victim’s classmates noticed bruises, she told them Darr had been “physically abusing her,” according to court documents. A Department of Child Safety case worker removed her from the home in early December and took her directly to the hospital. The caseworker noted several things about the victim’s appearance, including that she was underweight, had dark circles under her eyes, “noticeably thin hair,” red marks and visible scars on her scalp. According to the probable cause for arrest statement, the victim told the caseworker that her thin hair “was due to her hair being ripped off her head when [Darr] pulled her by her hair,” and that the red marks “were from [Darr] grabbing and pulling her by the hair.” She also explained one of the scars, saying it “was from when [Darr] hit her with a phone on the head and she bled.” She said Darr “super glued her head shut on that occasion.” But those were not the only injuries. The victim told doctors at the hospital that “her chest hurt and she was having trouble breathing, due to [Darr] kicking her in the chest several times ….” Medical staff also noted “several scars on her scalp, pre-existing injuries to her hand and feet … blisters in her mouth from eating food that was too hot … [and] bruising on her face.” Court documents detail several specific incidents of abuse as related by the victim to a forensic interviewer. According to that paperwork, Darr “would force [the victim] eat rotten leftovers from the fridge and when [she] would throw up, [Darr] would force [her] to eat it.” The victim also said Darr grabbed “her by the hair and slammed her head into the laundry room wall hard enough to break the drywall causing a dent.” The probable cause for arrest statement goes on to list other incidents in which Darr “would bend [the victim’s] fingers back causing further damage to her [injured] hand and [stomp] on her feet causing them to bleed and scab.” Police said there is corroboration for what the victim says happened. After the victim was removed from the home, her older sibling “confessed to his school counselor ... the allegations against [Darr] regarding the abuse on [the victim were] true.” The teen said Darr “had pulled him and his two older sisters … out of school to prevent them from talking about the abuse in the home.” According to court documents, the teen also said Darr “has told him and his younger brothers … to lie to DCS and detectives when being interviewed and coached the family about what to say during the previous investigations.” Police say the teen apologized to a forensic interviewer for lying, explaining that Darr had threatened him “if [he] talked about the abuse.” What the teen told the interviewer was consistent with what the victim said. He explained that the victim’s “hand was slammed in a car door in the past and was never treated by a doctor” and said Darr “will now grab that hand, which causes [the victim] pain, and squeeze and bend her hand back.” He also said he saw Darr “put really hot sauce and horseradish sauce in [the victim’s] food and force feed her.” In addition, he confirmed what the victim said about being made to “eat her regurgitated food.” The teen said his older sisters also saw all of this happen. According to police who arrested Darr, she “denied any allegation of child abuse and stated, she has never hit any of her children.” As of Thursday afternoon, Darr was still in custody, according to the Pinal County Sheriff's Office.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Maricopa woman accused of physically abusing girl, making her eat vomit", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Catherine Holland", "sitename": "AZFamily", "image_url": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/azfamily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/ae/4aec1fcc-0f88-11e9-a26b-57796d17df2a/5c2e59c7084be.image.jpg?crop=307%2C185%2C84%2C119&resize=332%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9891424775123596, "responded_url": "https://www.azfamily.com/news/maricopa-woman-accused-of-physically-abusing-girl-making-her-eat/article_fc9690fa-0f87-11e9-83bf-cb4d3938ba7b.html", "publisher": "azfamily.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103224750-00075.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T23:09:17+00:00"}

Melosh traces the myth back to a Walt Disney television special in 1955 that talked about it always being dark on the other side of the moon and futuristic astronauts dropping flares.  The term dark side really took off in 1973 with the Pink Floyd's mesmerizing album \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\"  While China is the first to land a spacecraft on the far side, there have been plenty of detailed photographs taken by orbiting spacecraft.

Apple cut its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than 15 years as it deals with shrinking demand in China and fewer owners upgrading their smartphones. Shares in Apple fell nearly 9%, serving as the biggest decliner on the Dow Jones Industrial Average in Thursday trading. Delta Air Lines said the pace of ticket-price increases slowed last month, prompting a selloff in U.S. airline stocks. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, also warned Thursday that other U.S. firms could join Apple in seeing weaker sales. The White House expected the economy to grow 3% this year, Mr. Hassett said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Fed officials projected 2.3% growth when they met two weeks ago. \"There are signs that the Chinese economy is slowing sharply,\" Mr. Hassett said in the interview. \"Multinational firms with profits in China are probably going to see at least that part of their profit picture sour a little bit.\" Analysts have largely expected U.S. companies to see slower earnings growth this year. Greg Boutle, U.S. head of equity and derivative strategy for BNP Paribas, is expecting earnings growth for S&P 500 companies to slow to 5% from the more than 20% growth seen in 2018. The news from Apple and Delta, along with soft guidance form FedEx Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. at the end of last year, has fed into negative market expectations, he said. \"When we start to see a trend of more bearish forward-looking guidance, that is something we would expect investors to start to extrapolate for the broader market,\" Mr. Boutle said. Neil Goddin, manager of the Kames Global Equity fund of Kames Capital, said further warnings across multiple sectors, especially from luxury goods and industrials, will likely mean markets will continue to fall. Mr. Goddin warns markets could go \"a lot lower if we truly are entering a meaningful slowdown.\" --Lorena Ruibal contributed to this article.

That doesn't quite make up for the $3,750 drop in federal tax credits, and it still doesn't get the company to its stated goal of selling the Model 3 for as low as $35,000.  According to independent delivery reports, Tesla actually added slightly to its stockpiled inventory of Model 3s in December, despite overlapping efforts to bring buyers in. That's led some observers to speculate that all the remaining customers in Tesla's order books are waiting to buy Standard Range Model 3s, which CEO Elon Musk has said since the car's conception will cost $35,000.  So far Tesla has never built a $35,000 Model 3. Musk has said the company needs \"5 to 6 months\" of full production of more expensive versions of the car to rebuild its tattered finances before it can begin selling Model 3s for that little.  Following Wednesday's $2,000 price drop, the cheapest Model 3 buyers can get costs $45,200, including a typical $1,200 destination charge.  If buyers earn the full $3,750 federal tax credit on the car (and don't qualify for any other state or local credits), they can bring home a base Mid Range Model 3 for an effective cost of $41,450—getting closer to the mythical $35,000 Tesla, but still a ways off.  When he first introduced the car in 2015, Musk said the Model 3 would cost $35,000 before accounting for any tax credits—or, apparently, Tesla's usual practice on its pricing estimates of subtracting theoretical gas savings from the purchase price. As with other automakers, though, the $35,000 target price would not reflect the $1,200 delivery charge, so realistically, those buyers will pay at least $36.200.  All-in, the new price is still $9,000 more expensive than the car thousands of drivers are still waiting for.  Tesla introduced the cheaper Mid Range Model 3 in October in an effort to bring down prices for those buyers waiting for base Model 3s, then raised its price by $1,000 a few days later.  All Model 3s produced so far also come with the Premium interior, including heated, 12-way power leather seats, GPS navigation, and a tinted glass roof. These features are expected to be deleted on the base $35,000 car, along with it having a shorter, 220-mile battery pack.

Merzbow is best known for a style of harsh, confrontational noise as exemplified on the 1996 release Pulse Demon. Since 1980, Akita has released over 400 recordings and has collaborated with various artists. The name Merzbow comes from the German dada artist Kurt Schwitters' artwork Merzbau, in which Schwitters transformed the interior of his house using found objects. The name was chosen to reflect Akita's dada influence and junk art aesthetic. In addition to this, Akita has cited a wide range of musical influences from progressive rock, heavy metal, free jazz, and early electronic music to non-musical influences like dadaism, surrealism, and fetish culture. Since the early 2000s, he has been inspired by animal rights and environmentalism, and began to follow a vegan, straight edge lifestyle. As well as being a prolific musician, he has been a writer and editor for several books and magazines in Japan, and has written several books of his own. He has written about a variety of subjects, mostly about music, modern art, and underground culture. His more renowned works were on the topics of BDSM and Japanese bondage. Other art forms Akita has been interested in include painting, photography, filmmaking, and Butoh dance.

Will that agenda find bipartisan support by politicians looking to score political points on Capitol Hill and within the Trump administration?  Many are confident that the leadership changes will jumpstart infrastructure investment that had been a priority of the White House but failed to gain momentum.  \"We're generally positive that those assuming leadership positions have a real commitment to infrastructure and ensuring that something gets done under their watch,\" Elaine Nessle, executive director of the Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors, a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group, told FreightWaves.  In February 2018, President Trump unveiled a formal infrastructure plan that sought to raise $1.5 trillion through state, local, and private investment by leveraging $200 billion in federal spending over 10 years.  \"Rather than telling governors and mayors what to do, we will partner with them as they invest in the most pressing projects in the highest-need places,\" said Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn at the time. \"And where it makes sense, we will move old infrastructure off the government balance sheet and into private investment.\"  But Trump's infrastructure plan, and its emphasis on local government and private investment, took a backseat to other issues throughout 2018 – namely border security – and Congress was satisfied to wait for the November midterm elections before taking it up again. With Democrats winning control of the House of Representatives as a result those elections, there has been a renewed emphasis on infrastructure from both sides of the aisle.  Don't miss it. Register today.  One of the more important developments is that Peter DeFazio (D-OR) will become chairman of the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction over highways, railroads, aviation, and the U.S. Coast Guard.  DeFazio, who was first elected to Congress in 1986, has helped craft several multi-billion surface transportation reauthorization packages when he was ranking member of the Highways subcommittee. Joining DeFazio on the House T&I Committee's leadership will be ranking member Sam Graves, a Republican from Missouri who chaired the Highways subcommittee and is said to be anxious to take action on infrastructure.  DeFazio has made his intentions known about bringing back earmarks as a means of funding infrastructure projects, which is another potential positive for freight transportation.  Earmarks were banned in 2010 by House Republicans because of abuse by members of Congress who had control over the federal purse strings. Since then, projects to expand road, rail, and port facilities have had to rely instead on competitive grants and other funding sources for federal dollars. As a result, certain projects considered critical to moving cargo have been delayed.  With the Democrats taking control of the House, \"I think the probability of getting [earmarks] reinstated is pretty high,\" Mark Sickles, government relations director for Weeks Marine, a port and harbor dredging contractor, told FreightWaves. \"There are probably enough votes to pass earmarks in the House and even the Senate, maybe by including restrictions as a way to keep things from getting out of hand, which led to them being banned.\"  Another development that comes with the change in House leadership and which could prove pivotal for freight infrastructure funding is a stated desire by Earl Blumenauer (another Democrat from Oregon) to establish an infrastructure subcommittee within the House Ways & Means Committee.  According to Capitol Hill sources, one reason why Blumenauer, who is a member of the committee's tax policy subcommittee, is interested in taking such action is to put more urgency in developing infrastructure \"pay-fors,\" which could include raising the federal gasoline tax, which fuels the Highway Trust Fund but has been stuck at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993.  Because of inflation, the fund's purchasing power for the concrete, steel, and asphalt that builds roads and bridges has been essentially cut in half over the last 25 years. The American Trucking Associations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have both endorsed raising the tax – by 25 cents in the case of the U.S. Chamber – to help cover the shortfall and to keep the trust fund from going bankrupt.  In the Senate, where Republicans added to its majority (bringing their total to 53), a change at the top could help promote the freight infrastructure cause.  John Thune (R-South Dakota) will move from chairing the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee to become Majority Whip, the second-highest ranking Republican in the Senate after Mitch McConnell.  Thune said in a recent interview with USA Today that he considers the move \"a way to keep issues important to South Dakota on the national agenda,\" with railroad infrastructure being one of them, by helping to round up legislative votes from his Senate colleagues.  Dan Elliott, former chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, which oversees regulation affecting railroads and their customers, points out that South Dakota is a major agriculture state with many rail shippers. \"So when we had a rail service crisis that had a significant effect on North and South Dakota, they paid extremely close attention to how we were handling it\" at the board, he told FreightWaves. \"Senator Thune cares a lot about the industry and will be in position to increase the exposure of issues affecting rail shippers.\"  Taking over from Thune as chair of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee is Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Wicker's most recent freight initiative was the Port Improvements Act, which he introduced in August and was aimed at building cargo efficiency through port and intermodal connections.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "New Capitol Hill Leadership Ready To Push Freight Infrastructure Agenda", "tags": "", "categories": "Government", "author": "FreightWaves", "sitename": "Benzinga", "image_url": "https://cdn2.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/bz2_opengraph_meta_image_400x300/images/story/2012/capital-hill-2645396_1920_2.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9744508862495422, "responded_url": "https://www.benzinga.com/government/19/01/12927772/new-capitol-hill-leadership-ready-to-push-freight-infrastructure-agenda?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+benzinga%2Fnews+%28Channels+-+News%29", "publisher": "benzinga.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103192509-00074.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T20:09:49+00:00"}
{"requested_url": "https://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/wood-buildings-are-back-and-new-york-times-it.html", "plain_text": "And whatever you do, don't read the comments. There is a hilarious twitter feed I follow, @nytonit, short for The Times is on it! \"Because sometimes stories in newspapers are just *that* obvious.\" The recent article by C. J. Hughes in the New York Times real estate section, Log Cabins? No, These Wooden Buildings Are High-Rises is a great candidate for it, from its first line on: \"Developers have not used wood for much other than houses since the horse-and-buggy days. But the knotty building material is making a comeback,\" followed up with \"For those who expect wooden buildings to resemble log cabins, the current crop may come as a surprise.\" Nail-laminated timber fortifies T3, a three-year-old, seven-story office building in Minneapolis’s North Loop neighborhood. Eighty-two percent of the steel-clad building, whose name is shorthand for “timber, technology and transit,” is leased to tenants like Amazon, which occupies three floors. There is also co-working company Industrious, which had an easier time renting space here than in its other more conventional buildings. A founder noted: “It’s almost like walking into a Swedish sauna,” he said. “It’s incredibly beautiful.” The article concludes with words from developer Jeff Spiritos, who says “I feel so strongly about the environmental imperative of changing the way we build for the health of the planet.” Don't read the comments! But hilarity ensues when you read the comments. Two years ago, when the Guardian covered mass timber construction, I wrote a whole article covering the comments section, addressing issues of deforestation, fire, CO2 storage, glues, and more. The New York Times comments address all the same questions and raises some new ones, so I will address a few of them. One of these stick built firetraps burned down in Tucson while it was under construction. It melted the construction crane, melted cars parked across the street and damaged another apartment building. There's a youtube video of one burning down in Texas. That's all they are, tinder boxes. Stick built construction is not heavy timber or mass timber. There have been many construction fires of lightweight stick frame buildings and a few significant fires in completed buildings, which depend entirely on drywall and sprinklers for protection. Mass timber is different because of that word Mass. It is designed with an extra char layer. They are two completely different forms of construction. Even a fire Lieutenant couldn't figure this out and wrote \"these \"pre-engineered\" materials perform miserably when exposed to direct flame contact under fire conditions.\" Again, This is not lightweight stick-framing! No old trees are available any more except those from tropical forests which are the lungs of the planet. So these wood buildings may be cutting down on the amount of oxygen available in the atmosphere. The opposite is true. The wood is local, and is replanted, and increased the amount of oxygen and the new trees grow. Construction industry leaders such as AISC and ACI (which are the steel and concrete construction chambers, respectively) have long advocated against the use of mass timber for high rises for the obvious reasons. Well they would, wouldn't they? Kind of seems like they have a vested interest. Like so many current trends affecting consumer products, wooden buildings are great for everyone but the end user - the horrific sound transmission alone makes them uninhabitable (there is a reason violins and piano sounding boards are wooden). Mass timber buildings usually have concrete poured on top and have better sound ratings than steel or some concrete buildings. This is all new to people, and there are many misconceptions. It is also new to architects and builders, and there is a learning curve to everything. Perhaps in a few years, when a few more buildings are built in New York, we won't get the \"log cabin\" titles and the inane comments.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Wood buildings are back, and the New York Times is on it!", "tags": "", "categories": "Corporate Responsibility", "author": "Lloyd Alter", "sitename": "Treehugger", "image_url": "https://media.treehugger.com/assets/images/2016/12/t3-interior1.jpg.600x315_q90_crop-smart.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9704204201698303, "responded_url": "https://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/wood-buildings-are-back-and-new-york-times-it.html", "publisher": "treehugger.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103192509-00074.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T20:12:20+00:00"}

The offshore unit of China National Tobacco Corp. is not only in a sunset industry that’s been under attack globally because of smoking’s link to cancer, it’s also found itself in the crosshairs of the U.S.-China trade war. Add to that a forecast slump in revenue and a struggling Hong Kong stock market, and there’s enough to give most investors a coughing fit.  On the plus side, China Tobacco’s state-owned parent is by far the biggest cigarette maker in the world, holding a monopoly in a country with more than 300 million smokers. Tobacco revenues added $160 billion in profit and tax to government coffers in 2016, according to the latest available data, a contribution that’s helped to insulate the industry from the anti-smoking campaigns that have assailed cigarette makers elsewhere.  The U.S. supplied 33.5 percent of the company’s tobacco leaf import revenue in the nine months to Sept. 30, China Tobacco said in a stock exchange filing this week. However, the unit has stopped buying from the U.S. after the Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on Chinese products from machinery to robotics in July. Beijing retaliated with an equal tariff on 106 categories of U.S. goods, including tobacco leaf.  China Tobacco predicts a “significant decline” in its tobacco leaf import business revenue for 2019.  The unit has smaller operations exporting Chinese tobacco to Southeast Asian countries including Indonesia, and selling cigarettes in duty-free outlets in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore and Macau. Exports – largely from the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan – have been decreasing in recent years, while the duty-free business is dependent on continued growth in Chinese tourists, who are the main consumers, the company notes.  Hong Kong was the world’s busiest venue for initial public offerings last year, beating New York and Shenzhen. But many of the year’s biggest listings, such as Xiaomi Corp., are trading underwater. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index sank into a bear market in September, marking a decline of more than 20 percent from its January peak.  Most major tobacco stocks have performed poorly in recent years. Japan Tobacco Inc., a former government monopoly, lost 24 percent in the past five years, Philip Morris International Inc. is down 21 percent and British American Tobacco Plc dropped 23 percent. Altria Group Inc. has risen 31 percent.  China Tobacco offers a rare chance for investors to access a nation where cigarette sales have bucked the global trend of declines. Yet even in China, health concerns have been starting to weigh. Last year, lawmakers in the National People’s Congress called for higher taxes on cigarettes to deter smoking among the young. And some cities have sought to impose bans on smoking in public places. China adds more than 4 million new cancer patients each year.  Investors tempted by the waft of monopoly profits should be warned: Cigarettes can damage your financial health, too.

However, the substandard snowpack was a far cry from last year’s measurement, when the hills in Phillips, the site of the survey near Echo Summit in the Sierra Nevada, received patchy snow at best.  John King, a DWR water resource engineer who conducted the survey, measured 25.5 inches of snow at Phillips, which is equivalent to 9 inches of water, reaching 80 percent of average for this time of year and 36 percent of average April levels.  “While these results are below average, they are a stark contrast to where we were last year,” King said, adding that “anything is possible from now until May.”  $20 for 365 Days of Unlimited Digital Access  Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year! Act now!  #ReadLocal  Statewide, California fared worse. Overall, the snowpack is at 67 percent of average for this time of year at 7.1 inches of snow-water, according to DWR data.  As of Wednesday, the Northern Sierra and Trinity region was at 61 percent of average for this date at 6.7 inches of snow-water, the Central Sierra to the east of Sacramento was at 69 percent of average for this date at 7.9 inches of snow-water, and the Southern Sierra, which stretches to the end of the Valley, was at 72 percent of average for this date at 6.1 inches of snow-water, according to DWR data.  The Sierra snowpack supplies California with about 30 percent of its water via runoff, according to the DWR.  The Northern Sierra saw 41 inches of precipitation between October 2017 and October 2018, which is significantly lower than the 94.7 inches in 2016-17, but above 2014-15’s 37.2 inches. The region’s yearly average is 51.8 inches, according to DWR data.  The San Joaquin area received 29.7 inches of precipitation in 2017-18, compared to its yearly average of 40.2 inches. The Tulare Basin region received 17.9 inches in 2017-18 while its yearly average is 28.8, according to DWR data.  “The last few years have shown how variable California’s climate truly is and what a profound impact climate change has on our water resources,” DWR Director Karla Nemeth said in a prepared statement. “California’s significant weather variability means we can go from historic drought to record rainfall, with nothing in between. Climate change will continue to exacerbate the extremes, creating additional challenges for maintaining water supply reliability and the need for innovative solutions.”  Michael Anderson, a department climatologist, said that although snow-water levels were somewhat lacking, it does not spell disaster for the rest of the year.  “We’re below average, but there’s still opportunity. We’re only through the first of our three wettest months of the season,” Anderson said. “December, January and February are when we typically accumulate half our annual (precipitation).”  The state is currently 2-4 degrees Fahrenheit higher than average, due in part to a weak tropical el Niño, Anderson said, though it has been consistently warmer than average since 2013 and can expect to see warming trends moving forward consistent with climate change.

The street, called Lynn Lane, already has been built out to its first intersection at Logan Lane — a new paved street itself.  The development site is located on the south side of Rombach Avenue, between the El Dorado Mexican Restaurant and the Wilmington Auto Center dealership.  LT Land Development LLC is the owner and developer of the site — that is, it’s the owner except for a number of parcels already acquired by business interests, plus 10.7 acres of wooded area donated to the City of Wilmington and located next to the J.W. Denver Williams Jr. and David R. Williams Memorial Parks.  The woodlands, which are part of the Lytle Creek greenway corridor, were donated personally by Larry Roberts II and his wife Terri. LT Land Development, housed at 94 North South Street in downtown Wilmington, is owned by the Roberts.  The business interests that have purchased lots at the development site are First State Bank which presently is building a bank on site, Jobriana Inc. (associated with El Dorado), Southern Hills Community Bank, and the Wilmington Auto Center which has expanded its footprint by obtaining property adjacent to the dealership.  First State Bank President and CEO Michael “Mike” P. Pell said Wednesday the firm is hoping the new Wilmington bank will be ready to open its doors in mid-summer. Currently, the planned opening is “right on schedule” and bank staff are excited, added Pell.  “As it’s going up, I really like that location,” Pell said.  First State Bank has been a part of southern Ohio since 1884.  Wilmington Parks & Recreation Director Jermaine Isaac said Wednesday the plans for the donated woodlands are for it to remain wooded and be a nature preserve.  The City has already done some work on the area, using Ohio Public Works Commission funds, he said. Part of the work involved eradication of invasive plant species, especially honeysuckle.  “That gets the woods a little more open. We’ve done that. The next thing is hazardous tree removal, such as dead ash trees,” said Isaac.  Recreational trails will be added through the woods, which stand behind the soccer fields in the David R. Williams Memorial Park off Fife Avenue.  The City’s acquisition of the 10-plus acres also will aid it in helping protect the corridor of Lytle Creek, a local stream that is visible in the woods.  “We really appreciate the donation the Roberts gave us. It shows they are conscious about our community and they want to be able to help out our parks and city to be able to preserve land in the community in its natural state, protecting Lytle Creek as best we can,” said Isaac.  There is an existing traffic light at the intersection of Rombach Avenue and Lynn Lane (which is opposite Carrie Drive).  In addition to Lynn Lane and Logan Lane, a third named street in the development is Elizabeth Lane.  There are a number of other lots at the development site that have been officially approved and can now be sold, said Wilmington attorney William “Bill” E. Peelle, a spokesperson for the LT Land Development project.

(AP) — Republican Eric Schmitt took the oath Thursday as Missouri's attorney general, pledging to pursue issues such as the opioid epidemic and vowing that neither he nor his staff would use a message-deleting app on work phones.  Missouri Chief Justice Zel Fischer gave Schmitt, 42, the oath of office in the Jefferson City Supreme Court building as his wife and three children surrounded him.  \"Now it is time to get to work, with the humility and conviction necessary to honor this office, and fight for all 6 million Missourians,\" Schmitt said in prepared remarks.  Schmitt said he'll focus on the opioid epidemic and supporting local prosecutors during his time in office.  He declined to comment when asked by a reporter whether he'll continue investigations started by his predecessor, Josh Hawley, who is leaving to join the U.S. Senate after unseating Democrat Claire McCaskill in November.  Schmitt said no one in his office will use a message-deleting app called Confide on their work phones, and he's encouraging staff not to use it on their personal phones either.  The app raised concerns about government transparency because staffers under former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned amid personal and political scandal in June, used it.  Schmitt also said there will be a \"bright line\" between his political campaign and official work by staffers, a response to pushback Hawley received for hiring political consultants who advised official staff.  When asked whether he plans to run to keep his seat in 2020, Schmitt said he's \"very focused on this job now.\"  Schmitt served roughly two years as the state's elected treasurer until Republican Gov. Mike Parson named him as Hawley's replacement.  Hawley's departure set off a chain reaction of vacancies. Parson just weeks ago named the next treasurer, state House Budget Chairman Scott Fitzpatrick, to fill Schmitt's seat.  Fitzpatrick will be sworn in Jan. 14, a slight delay that will give him the chance to serve two four-year terms on top of the close to two years left of Schmitt's term, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.  Under Missouri's term limits, most statewide elected officials can only run for two terms. But state law allows appointees to run for two full terms if they serve less than two years in their appointed position.  Fitzpatrick told the newspaper that there were other factors aside from term limits that factored into the delayed start date, including reviewing his personal holdings and investments.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Republican Schmitt sworn in as Missouri's attorney general", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Summer Ballentine; Associated Press", "sitename": "Associated Press", "image_url": "https://www.lmtonline.com/img/pages/article/opengraph_default.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9804823398590088, "responded_url": "https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Republican-Schmitt-sworn-in-as-Missouri-s-13506206.php", "publisher": "lmtonline.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103192509-00074.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T20:23:02+00:00"}

Discussing the high standards she felt were required when the Obamas were in the White House, she said: \"We can't make mistakes. We can't get indicted.\" At the mention of indictment, Obama paused and the crowd laughed loudly. Trump has been implicated in numerous felonies, though he has not been charged with any crimes and maintains his innocence. Trump is almost certain to avoid indictment while in office, as per Department of Justice guidelines. Michelle Obama this week took a subtle swipe at President Donald Trump and the possibility that he might be indicted. Speaking in Detroit on Tuesday, the former first lady spoke about the scrutiny she and her family faced as a black family in the White House. \"We can't make mistakes. We can't get indicted,\" the Detroit Free Press reported. The crowd roared in approval, according to the newspaper and video footage of the event. Obama paused when she mentioned indictment, a break the crowd eagerly filled with laughter. Obama said there was a double standard in how Trump and his family were treated compared to the way she, her husband, and their family were treated while in the White House. \"There is a difference in standards,\" she said. \"We are seeing that right now. We live with double standards all the time.\" Trump has been implicated in felonies by federal prosecutors, though he has not been charged with a crime and he maintains his innocence. Most recently, American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Inquirer, on Wednesday joined Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen in implicating Trump in campaign finance violations. Though the US Constitution does not say whether a sitting president can be indicted, today's Department of Justice policy holds that the president cannot. Several legal experts have told Business Insider that policy is perhaps the only reason Trump has not been indicted. On Wednesday, The New York Times published an opinion piece by a former Justice Department legal expert saying that Trump technically could be indicted but that it was unlikely to happen. Former President Barack Obama has previously commented on the high number of people close to Trump who have been charged with crimes or investigated on suspicion of corrupt activity. \"Not only did I not get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted,\" he said in a speech in November. \"By the way, it was the only administration in modern history that that can be said about. In fact, nobody came close to being indicted, probably because the people who joined us were there for the right reasons.\"", "published_date": "2018-12-13", "title": "Michelle Obama made a subtle joke about Trump potentially getting indicted, and the crowd loved it", "tags": "", "categories": "Politics", "author": "Sinéad Baker", "sitename": "Business Insider", "image_url": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c122655a6df15486549bd03-1536-768.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.987350583076477, "responded_url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/michelle-obama-trump-mueller-probe-we-cant-get-indicted-2018-12", "publisher": "businessinsider.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104025036-00076.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T03:21:50+00:00"}

Even when your spouse is on a business trip or your children are away at summer camp, you will always have someone (or something) to talk to. In the morning, you could ask the microwave to heat up a bowl of oatmeal. In your car, you could tell your stereo to put on some '90s music. And when you walk into the office, you could ask your smartphone, \"What's on my calendar today?\" This is increasingly the world that the tech industry is building with a bloating portfolio of devices that can react to voice commands — and that the companies will be pitching to you even more in 2019. The future will be on display next week at CES, a consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas that serves as a window into the year's hottest tech trends. Artificially intelligent virtual assistants will take centre stage as the most important tech topic, with companies big and small expected to showcase voice-controlled devices like robot vacuums, alarm clocks, refrigerators and car accessories. Most of these products will be powered by Amazon's Alexa or Google's Assistant, the two most popular artificially intelligent assistants, industry insiders said. \"AI will pervade the show,\" said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, which owns CES. If this all sounds like a repeat of last year, that's because much of it is. AI was 2018's hottest tech trend, too. In other words, the tech industry is in a state of iteration rather than making leaps and bounds with something totally new. Other tech trends that are progressing include the debut this year of fifth-generation cellular networks, known as 5G, which will significantly quicken mobile internet speeds. Cybersecurity products for home networks are also proliferating, an important safeguard now that consumers own so many devices that can connect to the internet. But as is often the case, there will also be plenty of talk in the coming week about overly optimistic tech that you would do best to sidestep for now. That's because some of the most hyped technologies — especially self-driving cars — are so far from reality that you won't see them in stores or dealerships anytime soon. Here's what to watch and what to avoid. Battle of the virtual assistants In 2015, Amazon birthed the Echo, the artificially intelligent speaker featuring the virtual assistant known as Alexa. A year later, Google responded with Home, its smart speaker powered by Google's own digital companion, called Assistant. Since then, in a bid to become your go-to digital companion, the two tech giants have teamed up with makers of devices like thermostats, doorbells, light bulbs and car accessories to add their virtual assistants to them. Google is expected to be even more aggressive this year with its Assistant. The company will triple the size of its presence at CES this year, suggesting it is likely to unveil a large array of products that work with Assistant. \"We're really leaning into the Assistant as the best way to get things done, helping you for lots of things as you go about your day,\" said Nick Fox, a Google executive who oversees Assistant. Amazon said it would also showcase a wide range of technologies next week that work with Alexa, as part of a vision it calls Alexa Everywhere. The company's goal is to expand the reach of its virtual assistant into every part of people's lives, including the kitchen, the living room, the office and the car. For you and me, here's a cautionary note: Virtual assistants are still in their infancy and have many shortcomings. We have to speak a very specific command to trigger a virtual assistant to control a device, like setting the temperature on a thermostat or turning on a lamp. Those unfamiliar with the lingo may find the devices even more difficult to use than pressing a button inside an app. \"We still have to learn their language, and they have not learned our language,\" said Frank Gillett, a tech analyst for Forrester, a technology research company. Security for your smart things Plenty of people install antivirus software on their computers. But what about all the other devices that can be connected to the internet, like smart watches, phones, televisions and speakers? In an era of smart things, the Wi-Fi router is becoming a bigger target for hackers, so expect a flood of new equipment and software that offer protection by improving your network security. For a sense of what to expect, consider Eero Plus, a subscription service that Eero, a maker of Wi-Fi equipment, released last year. Eero Plus includes protection against viruses and malware for all the devices connected to its Wi-Fi network. Last year, NetGear released NetGear Armor, a similar security service. More should follow this year — beginning next week at CES, where Scalys, a networking company, plans to introduce TrustBox, a router with built-in security features. The arrival of 5G This year, the wireless industry will begin a big upgrade to its infrastructure. Phone carriers say the 5G technology will deliver data at incredibly fast speeds, allowing people to download entire movies in a few seconds. In addition to increasing smartphone speeds, 5G will be important for other types of devices, like robots, self-driving cars, drones and security cameras. The technology is expected to greatly reduce latency, or the time it takes for devices to communicate with one another. But don't get too excited. Carriers say the new network technology will be deployed this year in only a few cities in Australia and the United States, and in some parts of Britain, Germany, Switzerland, China and South Korea. Here's what is still overhyped Virtual reality and self-driving cars have been talked about a lot in recent years, and they will still be talked about this year. But these two technologies are still nascent or premature. Over the past two years, tech companies like Facebook's Oculus, HTC, Google and Samsung have flooded the marketed with VR headsets and plenty of software and games. Yet people have not exactly embraced the products. \"The industry has been plagued by high-cost hardware, motion sickness, a dearth of compelling content and a general lack of consumer interest,\" said Victoria Petrock, an analyst for the research firm eMarketer, in a recent post. Self-driving cars are also still many years from becoming mainstream. Even though some companies have permits to test autonomous cars in California, Arizona and elsewhere, several of the leaders in the technology — such as Alphabet's Waymo — have refrained from committing to a release date for self-driving vehicles. \"There's going to be a lot of noise about automotive technology but nothing distinct or specific,\" Gillett said.

Since then, the U.S. Consulate has had staff in to see Paul Whelan. Whelan's family insist he's not a spy, and his Russian friends agree. It was not Whelan's first trip to Russia, and family said he was there attending the wedding of a friend and helping American guests navigate Moscow.  Whelan was active on Russian social media site VK, similar to Facebook, and had friends who were former members of the Russian military. It's believed that that could be a reason he was flagged by Russian authorities. Whelan spent 14 years in the Marine Corps reserve but was discharged for bad conduct in 2008.

{"requested_url": "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article223879645.html", "plain_text": "Paul Schwiep is suing Miami-Dade to regain his seat on the board overseeing the county’s half-percent transportation tax, claiming his ouster at the urging of Mayor Carlos Gimenez was a “political power play” to punish him for opposing a major highway extension.  The lawsuit by the Coconut Grove attorney comes weeks after a County Commission committee declined to take up a request by the transportation board to grant Schwiep a waiver for his role representing an environmental group opposing the extension of the State Road 836 toll expressway into Kendall.  A Miami-Dade rule bars any member of a county board from filing a lawsuit challenging county policy, and the County Attorney’s office cited that provision in declaring Schwiep had surrendered his seat on the Citizens Independent Transportation Trust.  This week Schwiep filed suit against the board’s director, saying the county misinterpreted its own rules. He asked a judge to reinstate him to the CITT board.  $20 for 365 Days of Unlimited Digital Access  Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year! Act now!  #ReadLocal  “The actions of the Transportation Trust violated due process of law,” Schwiep’s suit states, arguing the County Attorney’s Office “for political reasons wanted to punish Plaintiff for representing opponents of the tollway...”  Gimenez, the top advocate for the 836 extension, wrote commissioners on Dec. 12 urging them to reject the proposed waiver for Schwiep.  “I ask the Board to strongly consider whether a person who is actively engaged in a lawsuit against our County, regarding policy decisions that this Board has made, is in the best position to serve in an advisory position,” Gimenez wrote. The next day, the commission’s Transportation committee declined to consider Commissioner Eileen Higgins’ motion to grant Schwiep the waiver requested by his fellow board members.  Voters created the CITT board in 2002 as part of a referendum that also authorized the “half-penny” sales tax to fund new transit and transportation projects.  The CITT board can force commissioners to approve some transportation budget items by a two-thirds vote but has only used that authority once. That was earlier this year when the board voted to end authorization to spend the half-percent tax on routine transit operations. Miami-Dade commissioners have yet to take up the board’s action, a delay that preserves the current rules on spending the tax dollars.  A Gimenez spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit. Javier Betancourt, the transit board’s director, also declined to comment on the suit, which was filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court.  In the suit, Schwiep and his lawyers argue the administrative action he helped the Tropical Audubon Society file against Miami-Dade with state regulators does not constitute a lawsuit, and so wouldn’t trigger disqualification under the county rules.  He also said that as a lawyer, he shouldn’t be considered to have “filed” anything against Miami-Dade, since Schwiep isn’t the plaintiff. He noted he represented a different environmental group in a 2013 suit against Miami-Dade, and his board seat wasn’t an issue.  County lawyers say Schwiep’s ouster was triggered by his own inquiry about what role Miami-Dade rules allowed him to play as a lawyer in opposing the 836 extension, which Miami-Dade commissioners approved in September.  The $1 billion road project into West Kendall would be funded through tolls collected by the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority, an independent toll board led by Gimenez, who holds one of the appointed seats and serves as chairman.  In court papers, Schwiep said he was asking a judge to rule on his eligibility for the transportation-tax board because “no neutral arbiter has been involved in the process to date.”", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Critic ousted from Miami-Dade transit board sues, citing a “political power play”", "tags": "half penny, miami-dade, 836, lawsuit, schwiep, transportation trust, citt, gimenez", "categories": "", "author": "Douglas Hanks", "sitename": "Miami Herald", "image_url": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5618154292001/b76cd5e3-261e-45d8-b8c0-688c374d6c95/4128f3c1-c8e7-4647-9817-1acf3949ca6f/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9737351536750793, "responded_url": "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article223879645.html", "publisher": "miamiherald.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104025036-00076.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T03:48:47+00:00"}

But beware of the challenge.  Canada’s hopes ended in heartbreaking fashion last night with a 2-1 overtime loss to Finland at Rogers Arena in Vancouver. Finnish defenceman Toni Utunen beat Michael DiPietro in the Canadian net at 5:17 of OT for the quarterfinal win. The winning goal came after a glorious Canadian chance was foiled when Noah Dobson’s stick shattered on an attempted one-timer at a gaping Finland net. Canada was 46.4 seconds away from winning the elimination game when Eeli Tolvanen tied the score to force overtime when his centring attempt took a few odd bounces and ended up behind DiPietro. And the Canadians had a glorious chance in OT when team captain Maxime Comtois took a penalty shot, but was foiled by a pad save by Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen. The Finns now face surprising Switzerland in the semifinals Friday at Rogers Arena. The Swiss shocked highly favoured Sweden 2-0 in earlier quarterfinal action Wednesday. Canada’s loss means it won’t win a medal at the tournament for the first time since 2016, when they dropped a 6-5 decision to the Finns in the quarter-finals in Helsinki. “I’m sad, angry. It’s not good,” DiPietro, who finished with 32 saves, said after the loss. “Sometimes you’re going to get the bounces and sometimes you’re not. For the game to end up like this, it’s disappointing. For our group, it’s a tough pill to swallow.”  Price was back on the ice for team practice Wednesday in Brossard following what was described as a lower-body injury that forced him to skip a three-game road trip.  Head coach Claude Julien said he would decide on his starting goalie after seeing how Price feels on Thursday morning.  Price said he had been playing through the injury for seven weeks before tweaking it during a practice on Dec. 27. Later that day, his wife, Angela, gave birth to the couple’s second child, Millie, at the Jewish General Hospital.  “It was definitely a perfect storm and everything definitely happened to happen that way,” Price said after practice Wednesday when he was asked if there was any link between his injury time off and the birth of his daughter.  Angela Price also addressed the matter on her blog Wednesday. “I am sorry to say that he did have an injury,” she wrote. “When Carey would have done everything in his power to be at the birth of our baby (even if it means missing a game) he would not have missed an entire road trip for the birth. And to boot, the Habs are a very classy organization. I can’t ever imagine them lying or putting out false information about a player.”    Netflix said 45 million subscriber accounts worldwide watched the Sandra Bullock thriller Bird Box during its first seven days on the service, the biggest first-week success of any movie made for the company’s nearly 12-year-old streaming service. Netflix, which typically refuses to provide viewership numbers, made the rare disclosure in a recent tweet as movie producers, writers, actors and investors continue to size up a company that has already reshaped the way the world watches video.  The first-week audience means nearly one-third of Netflix’s 137 million subscribers watched the movie from Dec. 21 through Dec. 27 — a holiday-season stretch when many people aren’t working and have more free time. Had 45 million people actually gone to a theatre in the U.S. to watch Bird Box, it would have translated to about $400 million in box-office revenue, based on average ticket prices.  But people were watching the movie on a service for which they already had paid and had the luxury of doing so without leaving their homes. That makes watching Bird Box more comparable to watching a television program, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.  By that yardstick, the viewership for Bird Box is less impressive. For instance, the Super Bowl typically attracts 100 million to 110 million viewers in the U.S. alone. The annual telecast of the Academy Awards has drawn a U.S. audience of 26 million to 40 million in recent years. And those totals are for a single day, not a week.  Meanwhile, Netflix is warning viewers to avoid the so-called “Bird Box challenge” in which people don a Bullock-style blindfold and wander through the streets, or worse. One social media video shows a toddler taking a spill after running into a wall. Netflix tweeted: “Can’t believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE. We don’t know how this started, and we appreciate the love, but Boy and Girl have just one wish for 2019 and it is that you not end up in the hospital due to memes.”", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "While You Were Sleeping: Canada eliminated, Price rejuvenated", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Montreal Gazette", "sitename": "Montreal Gazette", "image_url": "https://postmediamontrealgazette2.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/HKO-World-Junior-Canada-Finland-20190102.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9730743765830994, "responded_url": "https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/while-you-were-sleeping-canada-eliminated-price-rejuvenated", "publisher": "montrealgazette.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103142237-00072.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T15:43:32+00:00"}

Michael Love-White, 33, was in Ferndale 43rd District Court on Thursday for a hearing on the theft of the money. Ferndale police said Love-White was working as shift manager at the Pizza Hut restaurant, 23137 Woodward Ave., in July 2017 when the theft happened. The suspect is believed to have fled to another state afterward, but an outstanding warrant was issued by Oakland County prosecutors charging him with embezzlement. Ferndale Police Detective Brendan Moore said investigators first learned about the incident after the manager of the Pizza Hut contacted police. “The manager told us the suspect worked until closing time on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday,” Moore said, “but he failed to show up for work on Monday.” The manager checked the deposits from sales at the restaurant for the weekend and discovered that none of them had been made at the bank. “They were missing $3,287,” Moore said. “The manager found an unsigned letter from the suspect apologizing for the theft and indicating he had some personal problems and owned money to some people.” Moore eventually contacted the suspect on his cell phone shortly after the theft of the cash was reported. “He said he was out of state and in Kentucky,” Moore said. “I asked him about the money. He said he owned some guys some money and they were looking for him.” Love-White verified that the amount of money stolen was accurate, he added. “He said the only way he could come up with the money he owed was to sacrifice his job and take the (restaurant) deposits,” Moore said. Police said Love-White was recently picked up on another charge and Ferndale police learned he was being held at the Wayne County Jail. The suspect was transported to Ferndale on Christmas Eve and arraigned before 43rd District Court Magistrate J. Patrick Brennan. Love-White remains jailed in the Oakland County Jail on $5,000 cash bond. The charge against him is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Police: Ferndale embezzlement suspect stole cash, left apology letter", "tags": "embezzlement, ferndale, pizza hut, oakland county jail, michael love-white", "categories": "", "author": "Mike McConnell mmcconnell com; On Twitter", "sitename": "RoyalOakTribune.com", "image_url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/dailytribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/fb/8fb80090-0f7d-11e9-8062-eb6193089b2d/5c2e4766251a7.image.jpg?resize=480%2C600", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.989188551902771, "responded_url": "https://www.dailytribune.com/news/local/police-ferndale-embezzlement-suspect-stole-cash-left-apology-letter/article_1a7ccda6-0f7d-11e9-8338-1b3b96058055.html", "publisher": "dailytribune.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103224750-00075.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T23:37:20+00:00"}

Question: Is it important to weather the storm early on against Alabama? Teams they’ve placed this year, they’re being outscored 45-25 in the first quarter. Alabama just jumps on you… and do what they do for the rest of the game. Is that a point of emphasis for you guys to weather the storm?  Bryant: No, we never plan on weathering anyone’s storm. We want to come out and attack and set the tempo so no, that’s definitely not our plan to weather the storm.  Question: Four straight Alabama-Clemson matchups in the College Football Playoff. Does it kind of feel like a rivalry at this point?  Bryant: “Yeah, a little bit it does. It seems we’re playing them every year. It’s becoming a saga I guess, kind of like “Rocky,” so yeah I guess you could consider it a developing rivalry.”  Question: What do you think about the first three? Is there a specific play or anything that comes to your mind when you kind of think about these matchups over the last few years?  Bryant: “ Of course the first game in 2015, all of the crazy stuff that happened in that game. The kickoff, the kick return. Then the game in 2016, they go down and score at the end of the game but our offense comes back and puts together a hell of a drive to win the game. Last year they dominated us…just very grateful to have the opportunity this year to write that next part of the story.”  Question: What do you take from the first couple of years personally? Is there anything you can take away or is it like you starting from scratch.  Bryant: “Oh I’m starting from scratch every year. You never want to assume anything because each year, each team is different no matter if it’s us or them so you never want to assume that you know everything because you have to start over from scratch and kind of rebuild to be the best in that moment that you can be.”  Question: How ready is Albert (Huggins) for this moment?  Bryant: “Oh, he’s ready. All of the guys are ready. They all put the same work in all season. They prepare just as well as Dex (Dexter Lawrence) and the rest of us. I have full confidence in Albert, Jordan (Williams), Nyles (Pickney)… I hate it (playing without Lawrence) but those guys are ready to play well.”", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Bryant ready to write next part of the story", "tags": "feature, football, hero, austin bryant, cfp national championship game, clemson, clemson football, clemson tigers", "categories": "", "author": "Katie Florio", "sitename": "The Clemson Insider", "image_url": "https://usattci.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/bryant-celebration.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9616146087646484, "responded_url": "https://theclemsoninsider.com/2019/01/03/bryant-ready-to-write-next-part-of-the-story/", "publisher": "theclemsoninsider.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103142237-00072.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T15:52:40+00:00"}

He’s on the lookout for a move in the January window, with Stoke’s blessing, after just five appearances so far in this the final year of his current contract with the club.  The former Scottish international, now 33, boasts a total of 103 starts and a further 61 from the bench during six-and-a-half years at Stoke City, but accepts the clock is now ticking on his time at the club.  Adam, who makes no secret of his willingness to return north of the border, particularly to old club Rangers, says: “We will see what happens in the window. Everyone knows my situation, I haven’t played as much as I’ve wanted to.  “I think the best for the club and for myself would be to go and play somewhere.  “It will be difficult and it will be emotional because I’ve enjoyed my six-and-a-half years here, but some good things in life come to an end and it might open another chapter.  “I’ve had one bad time and that was getting relegated, but every other day was amazing.  “It’s a great club, great people that run it and I’ve been managed by good people as well.  “When the day does come, it will be sad. It’s not just the staff, it’s people in the kitchen, the laundry, people like that as well that I’ll miss.”  Every fan will have their favourite Charlie Adam match, but what about the game-changing midfielder himself?  “There’s been a lot good memories, a lot of great times, a lot of good goals.  “But I’d probably go for beating Liverpool 6-1 on the last day of the season (2014/15).  “It was incredible for the whole stadium, the crowd, against my former team as well and it was a great way to finish the season.  “So I’d probably say that one, but I’ve had many great times here and I will always look back with fond memories.  “It’s the longest period I’ve been at a club and we’ve had some great times, but when a new manager comes in he brings in his own players. That’s football and I understand that.  “But I’ve always tried to work hard in training and await my opportunity if somebody gets injured, but we will see what happens.  “If nothing happens, then I’ll go to the summer and then go from there.”  The Stoke star was speaking during a recent visit to the Royal Stoke University Hospital to meet patients and families.  “It’s great to come and put a smile on their faces,” he said.  “When you come into a place like this you have to be upbeat and hopefully there is light at the end of the tunnel for the kids and for the parents as well.  “My little boy had an operation, minor operation compared to what these are having, but it’s the whole build up, the drama, being in hospital for the whole day. It is draining and difficult and as a parent you always worry about your kids.”", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Stoke City veteran picks out his favourite game as he looks for January exit", "tags": "Stoke City FC,Royal Stoke University Hospital,Charlie Adam,Liverpool FC;Royal Stoke University Hospital;Stoke City FC;Charlie Adam;Liverpool FC", "categories": "Football News", "author": "Martin Spinks", "sitename": "Stokesentinel", "image_url": "https://i2-prod.stokesentinel.co.uk/incoming/article2384822.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_GettyImages-474616340.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9845783710479736, "responded_url": "https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stoke-liverpool-rangers-charlie-adam-2384785", "publisher": "stokesentinel.co.uk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104072922-00077.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T08:02:00+00:00"}

The 52-year-old seemingly defies aging and wanted to encourage everyone who planned to commit to a new year’s resolution to attain healthier living.  “If you’re the type of person that purchases a gym membership Jan. 1st but doesn’t end up really using it, I’m talking to you! This #FitnessFriday is all about setting realistic goals and intentions for yourself in the #NewYear! Write them down, put them somewhere you see every day and keep them as your daily motivation to stay focused and inspired on your #2019 fitness journey,” Berry wrote.  She’s dedicated herself to healthier living and eagerly shares posts and videos about her adventures in fitness. She possesses an amazingly sculpted, toned physique and absolutely radiant skin. Every Friday, Berry shares a favorite workout and discloses diet tips for her social media followers to absorb.  Berry recently traveled to the Sahara Desert in Morocco, where she seductively posed in the middle of the richly brown desert completely topless. Her bare feet left a few prints in the gently rippled sand, dunes peaking behind her. She’s wearing a gauzy skirt starting below her belly button that settled on her lean hips, her jeweled hands covering her bare chest. Berry draped herself in beautiful beaded necklaces, her head tipped backward and eyes closed with a serene look on her face.  “Take care of your body, it’s the only place you have to live!” she wrote.  In the comments, an Instagram user thanked Berry for her motivating posts and dedication to fitness.  “I am a working mom and have decided to work on my health and I am currently doing keto and work out 4 times a week. It’s been quite the journey. Your posts are inspiring,” the user wrote.  According to Shape magazine, Berry’s favorite workouts include strength training, specifically Harley Pasternak’s 5-Factor Fitness plan, which includes five minutes each for warm-up, upper body strength training, lower body moves, core training exercises and fat-burning cardio work. She also loves kickboxing to boost her energy and strength. Finally, she enjoys hills surprisingly. She alternates between hiking, climbing stairs, and using the elliptical.  In one of her videos, she and her trainer, Peter Lee Thomas, talked about how her workouts are different every day of the week so her muscles are challenged regularly.

American golfer Tway carded a seven-under-par 66 to set the pace at the season-opening event in Maui, Hawaii on Thursday. Tway made seven birdies without dropping a shot to lead a field restricted to golfers who won a tournament during the previous calendar year. The 30-year-old's display was impressive after he withdrew from Wednesday's pro-am at the Plantation Course. \"It kind of felt like I was walking on a water bed the whole hole and so I withdrew from the pro-am, went to the doctor, had like an ear infection and sinus infection,\" Tway said. \"I got some pills and feel a little bit better today but still a little dizzy.\" Tway, who claimed the 2018 Safeway Open, ended the day ahead of Justin Thomas and reigning champion Dustin Johnson. American stars Thomas and Johnson had seven birdies and a bogey apiece on day one of the event, while Gary Woodland also recorded a 67. Patton Kizzire – three shots off the pace at four under – made the shot of the day as he registered a hole-in-one on the par-three eighth. It was Kizzire's first ace on the PGA Tour and he told Golf Channel: \"I was just trying to hit the green.

Bryan Alverez stated on Wrestling Observer’s Filthy Four Daily with Tom Lawlor (Via Cagesideseats.com) that Vince McMahon is planning to \"switch up\" The New Day again. Apparently, Vince McMahon is thinking about doing something different with the trio. The Chairman has stated this in the past as well but hasn't acted upon it. However, things look to be different this time around. In case you didn't know... The New Day is one of the longest-running faction in WWE History and probably the longest running faction in WWE as of now. The faction was formed in 2014 and has won the Tag Team Championships on five different occasions, which also includes their record-breaking 478-day Title reign. While the trio was initially a heel faction, The New Day has remained faces ever since their first turn. They are currently part of the SmackDown Tag Team division and are mostly used for comedy skits. The heart of the matter While The New Day has consistently been popular with the WWE Universe, many fans have started to call their act \"stale\" as of late. This could be the reason that McMahon has taken a personal interest in the trio and wants to shake up things a bit. It is still not clear as to what could be next for The New Day. A slightly edgier version of the existing gimmick could be a good idea and would help reinvigorate the trio. While some feel the time for The New Day to split up has come, I feel that all three men work much better together than separately. What's next? Ever since the McMahons have taken over the on-screen authority role, we have seen a number of changes in the programming. Hopefully, this \"switch-up\" for the New Day will be something the fans love.

Morgan upgraded the stock Dec. 13, the stock has rallied 12.4%.\" It seems that the opinion of market experts is that GE stock is simply \"bounc[ing] off last month's 9 1/2-year low.\" Or, simply put, GE stock is going up ... because it's already gone down so much there's really no place left to go but up. Now what Advertisement I don't buy that argument, however. Is GE stock down a lot? Sure it is. Even after two big bounces in the space of a week, GE shares still sell for less than half what they cost a year ago. And yet, the fact remains: This is a company with a $70 billion market cap (that just happens to cost only $8-and-change a share), carrying $115 billion in debt. GE's not earning profits. Its free cash flow is negative (according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence). And to top it all off, GE's sales were down last quarter -- so things are getting worse, not better. If GE were any other stock than GE, the idea that a stock in these dire straits couldn't go down anymore would be patently ridiculous. There's still a lot of room to go between here and zero. 10 stocks we like better than General ElectricWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

{"requested_url": "https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/claude-puel-never-win-over-2385843", "plain_text": "Premier League football fans must be scratching their heads in bewilderment as to why Claude Puel is not being universally lauded by Leicester City fans.  That is except for many Southampton fans - and Lyon supporters.  The Frenchman took over at City in October last season when the club was flirting with relegation but City still finished ninth, and reached two cup quarter finals.  This season City are currently seventh, only sat in the wake of the Big Six, and have gone out in another cup quarter final only after penalties.  They have done so after a hugely problematic first half of the campaign which has seen the club struggle to deal with the tragic helicopter crash that claimed the lives of five people, including much-loved chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.  They sit at the top of the Best of the Rest League having recently won three of their last four games, including victories over two of that Big Six; Chelsea and Manchester City.  Putting the season into perspective, it hasn’t been a bad job by City so far.  Bottom line, football is a results business, they say. If that was entirely true then Puel would be getting more credit from a section of the City fans than he is.  But he isn’t, so why?  A fierce debate has been raging, on social media at least, about Puel’s performance as City boss that has divided opinion amongst the Blue Army.  So far it has been confined to social media and in the traditional conversational melting pots – the pubs. There hasn’t been too much open dissension in the stands, but there has been murmurings, most notably during last Saturday’s home defeat to Cardiff City, the one disappointment in what has been a hugely productive Christmas period for City.  There certainly has not been the outright rebellion Puel experienced as Lyon boss in his third season.  Lyon had won seven consecutive Ligue 1 titles when Puel took over. In his first season they finished third. In his second they were runners-up and reached a Champions League semi-final for the first time in the club’s history.  By late September of his third season Lyon fans were calling for his resignation, with banners unfurled inside the stadiums and protests in the streets.  It was in stark contrast to his next job, at Nice, who had finished 15th, 17th and 13th until his arrival.  In his first season they finished fourth. This time the banners were of thanks to Puel.  The next season they finished 17th but they recovered to 11th and in his last season they finished fourth and qualified for European football.  The lure of the Premier League took him to Southampton, where he led the Saints to eighth in the Premier League and the League Cup final, and yet he was relieved of his duties after one campaign with a section of the Saints supporters bemoaning the style of play, branding it dull.  Even now, despite Southampton’s decline since Puel’s sacking, some Saints fans are unrepentant. He had to go, they still insist.  At Lyon, it was his inability to maintain their record-breaking dominance of the Ligue 1 title that upset the fans.  In England it seems it is his approach and style of play that is failing to win all the fans over, despite results.  At City he is accused of being overly cautious, especially at home, despite the fact he has swapped his two regular and more defensive full-backs in Christian Fuchs and Danny Simpson for younger more attack-minded ones.  He has opted for two holding midfielders in his system, even three destructive midfielders in recent games, and City won all three in which the trio of Papy Mendy, Wilfred Ndidi and Hamza Choudhury played.  It is in the final third that he is most heavily criticised as City remain reliant on Jamie Vardy, who often receives little support.  City’s patient build-up, switching play by passing square and backwards, certainly doesn’t suit Vardy’s instinctive game, where he thrives on the early ball over the top. There is no Danny Drinkwater to play that early ball now. Only Marc Albrighton or Vicente Iborra still seem to have that in their locker when he plays.  It also doesn’t satisfy many City fans who loved the direct, high-octane approach that made City so successful under Caludio Ranieri.  Puel has said he wants to evolve and equip City to meet different challenges, but the counter-attack still works, especially away from home, and that might legislate for the fact City’s away record is now better than at the King Power Stadium. It is easier to play that style on the road. It is effective (except Bournemouth and Crystal Palace, of course).  On home soil City’s more measured approach has proved frustrating to watch for some fans as City prod and probe, looking for an opening that often doesn’t appear. Too slow, too ponderous, they say.  This is where City need to improve, on home soil, if Puel is to win his doubters over. He still retains a large number of supporters amongst the fans, it would seem, but there are many who want more goals, more excitement, more thrills and spills.  Puel is unlikely to alter his approach. In terms of results, it has served him well during his career and it is hard to argue against his record.  If City do finish seventh it will be another decent effort, especially if they do well in the FA Cup, although it won’t appease those who have had their expectations raised by the title success  But even then Puel will have to accept that not every City fan will buy into how it was achieved.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Why Claude Puel will never win over all his Leicester City critics", "tags": "Leicester City FC,Ben Chilwell,Christmas,FA Cup,Football League Cup,UEFA Champions League,Jamie Vardy,Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha,King Power Stadium;Ben Chilwell;Christmas;FA Cup;Football League Cup;UEFA Champions League;Jamie Vardy;Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha;King Power Stadium;Leicester City FC", "categories": "Football News", "author": "Rob Tanner", "sitename": "Leicestermercury", "image_url": "https://i2-prod.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article2372302.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1075690006.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9880892634391785, "responded_url": "https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/claude-puel-never-win-over-2385843", "publisher": "leicestermercury.co.uk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103192509-00074.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T20:32:31+00:00"}

Bernie Sanders and his chief lieutenants are offering contrition as some of his 2016 campaign staffers face allegations of sexual harassment.  Hours after a New York Times report detailed allegations of unwanted sexual advances and pay inequity on his first campaign, Sanders apologized late Wednesday \"to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately.\"  \"Of course, if I run again, we will do better next time,\" Sanders told CNN.  In the wake of the report, some Democratic activists and operatives complained about the aggressive culture during the first campaign when male staffers and supporters were sometimes labeled \"Bernie bros.\"  \"I'm not the least bit surprised,\" National Organization for Women President Toni Van Pelt told The Associated Press, noting she was forced to block Sanders' supporters from her social media feed in 2016. \"To me, it was really clear this was the way they were running the campaign.\"  She blamed Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump, at least in part, on Sanders and his supporters.  \"It wasn't just Trump, it wasn't just the Russians, it was also the sexist people that ran his campaign,\" Van Pelt said.  Sanders' senior adviser told the AP last month that Sanders would run a \"much bigger\" operation and would start out as a front-runner if he ultimately decided to run.  Should he run again, the 77-year-old would enter a crowded field that features multiple prominent liberal women. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already launched a presidential exploratory committee. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who has been a central figure in Washington's reckoning with the #MeToo era, is considering a presidential run.  Even before the Times' story was published, Politico reported that more than two dozen former campaign workers and volunteers had requested a meeting with Sanders to discuss sexual violence and harassment that occurred during the 2016 campaign.  The Times detailed one situation in which a campaign surrogate touched a strategist's hair in a \"sexual way,\" among other unwanted advances. The Times also reported that in some cases, women were expected to sleep in the same quarters as men they didn't know. Others discovered examples of men who were paid significantly more for doing similar jobs.  Sanders' wife, Jane O'Meara Sanders, said the meeting with concerned former staff and volunteers would take place in a matter of days, although it had not yet been scheduled as of late Wednesday.  \"The fact is if somebody didn't feel safe in any way, it was a failure. I, we apologize profusely. This is not acceptable,\" she told the AP. She continued: \"I welcome hearing from the individuals that had such problems because we need to talk about this. And women need to feel and to be safe on campaigns, in their workplaces, on campuses and in their homes.\"  O'Meara Sanders said she and her husband became aware of the allegations only after the campaign was over. They subsequently implemented a series of safeguards on his 2018 Senate re-election campaign, which included mandatory staff training, strict guidelines and the creation of a complaint hotline run by a third party.  \"We didn't hear specific things during the campaign. We heard some of them after the campaign. We've heard others just now that were never reported,\" O'Meara Sanders said. \"We were, as you can imagine, out on the road and you do delegate. But we do think at the top level, people did the best they possibly could.\"  Sen. Sanders noted the 2016 campaign grew from just a handful of employees to roughly 1,200 workers in just a few months.  \"I am not going to sit here and tell you we did everything right in terms of human resources,\" he told CNN.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Bernie Sanders contrite as 2016 aides face harassment allegations", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "The Associated Press", "sitename": "Arkansas Online", "image_url": "https://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2019/01/03/AP19003068195313_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9908834099769592, "responded_url": "https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jan/03/bernie-sanders-contrite-2016-aides-face-harassment/", "publisher": "arkansasonline.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103142237-00072.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T16:19:57+00:00"}

That was his third successive start with Jonjo Shelvey working his way back to full match fitness after injury and South Korea international Ki Sung-yueng on international duty at the Asian Cup. However Hayden, who handed in a transfer request during the summer for family reasons, has revealed he still wants to go and is hopeful of getting his wish this month. He said: “It's unchanged and the club have known that from day one. It wasn't going to change. “My family, my partner and daughter will always come first. Football is football, but family is more important. “The club have had conversations already. Hopefully a solution can be found. It wasn't in the summer, but I was professional and got on with the job I have to do.” Hayden's admission comes with Benitez once again keeping his fingers crossed that owner Mike Ashley will sanction the signings he believes he needs to keep the club in the Premier League for another season. The Spaniard has decided not to talk about the transfer window having spent much of his time on Tyneside pleading both in public and behind closed doors for investment, too often to little effect. Just as it was 12 months ago, the situation is complicated by the prospect of a takeover with four groups currently attempting to put together a package to buy Ashley out. Amanda Staveley's PCP Capital Partners were unable to make tangible progress this time last year and no group appears close to doing so this time around. Benitez could get at least some of what he wants - he landed Martin Dubravka, Kenedy and Islam Slimani on loan during the last winter window - but that could have a knock-on effect in terms of price for any prospective buyer. In the meantime, Benitez, whose own contract is due to expire at the end of the campaign, will hope for improved fortunes after an eighth home league defeat of the season left the club just two points clear of the drop zone. The Magpies performed admirably for long periods against United, but were ultimately undone by an uncharacteristic error from Dubravka which allowed substitute Romelu Lukaku to give the visitors a lead.

I recently went on a long dive trip with 20 Russians in the Sea of Cortez. I enjoy being with these people, I remembered thinking as we toweled off and headed to our cabins after the last dive. Soon we were within cell phone range, and I scanned the news: the U.S was withdrawing from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. How in the world could this happen? My colleagues and I spent years at the National Security Agency in the ‘80s supporting this eventual treaty with the former Soviet Union. It was a proud moment, ending the standoff between dangerous Pershing and SS-20 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles. As a symbol of this historic agreement, an SS-20 still stands in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, but I wonder now if the Russians will want it back. When President Donald Trump ran for office, he raised many issues that, no matter what you think of him, no one else dared discuss. He questioned why we couldn’t have a better relationship with Russia and the future of NATO. These made sense to me — NATO will be 70 years old next year and was created to contain the Soviet Union. Can the role of something that old be reviewed without so much rancor? Evidently not, and as a result, NATO has become a vacuum cleaner, sucking into its club Eastern European nations that were once under the aegis of the former Soviet Union. I don’t know which came first, the chicken or the egg, just like I don’t know if NATO deployed first to Eastern Europe and Russia responded by creating problems for us around the world or the other way around. But NATO’s presence in former Warsaw Pact countries is arguably the major national security issue for Russia and the stumbling block to a better relationship. As NATO continues on its merry way, Russia will become more threatening. Last summer, thousands of NATO troops participated in an exercise in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia — Russia’s backyard and places most Americans wouldn’t fight for. Now Russia is giving us a taste of our own medicine: It plans to deploy nuclear-capable TU-160 bombers on a Venezuelan island base less than 1,400 miles from Miami. I’m not pleased. I live in Ft. Lauderdale. Let’s admit it: this Spy vs. Spy relationship with Russia has plunged us into a new Cold War that feels more threatening and unpredictable than the first. Russian “Bear” nuclear bombers now routinely fly near Alaska; Russia is suspected in attacks on U.S. diplomats in Cuba; Russian submarines and spy ships ply U.S. coastal waters; Russia plans to place its most modern air defense system in Crimea threatening the Black Sea; Russia poisons a former Russian spy in the U.K., and Russia captures Ukrainian ships and sailors after a flareup in the Black Sea.  While this national security threat grows, Washington appears to be in no mood to address it sensibly. Republican acolytes of the late Sen. John McCain still dismissively call Vladimir Putin a “thug.” These same individuals advocate global U.S. power projection at whatever cost and threw a tantrum when President Trump decided to pull just 2,000 troops out of Syria. Democrats have made it impossible for Mr. Trump to have meaningful dialogue with Russia given the collusion investigation. In July, Mr. Trump met Mr. Putin in Germany, and politicians went berserk, to the point where some in Congress wanted to question the interpreters. When Russia engages in bad behavior, the U.S. usually responds with sanctimoniousness and more sanctions. The latter have hurt Russia economically, but they have not stopped them from developing the hypersonic missile Avangard, which Vladimir Putin says can evade any Western air defenses. This weapon and tearing up the INF treaty are destabilizing and should drive us to the negotiating table to update the treaty, taking into account the many technological changes in weaponry that have occurred since 1988, and including a relatively new bully on the block — China. Moving forward, we need a “demilitarized zone” between Brussels and Moscow. NATO must eliminate or reduce troop levels in the Baltics, while Russia does the same in its neighboring oblast, Pskov. No more exercises in these regions will be permitted. Poland and Eastern Europe must be on the table for base and troop reduction as will be Kaliningrad and eastern Ukraine, where a civil war has raged for nearly six years. The Russian-held territory of Crimea is something Russia is not going to return to Ukraine. Russia just built a multi-billion dollar, nearly 11-mile bridge to Crimea, and this wasn’t only because it’s a nice place to vacation. Russia has three major naval fleets: one north in Severomorsk, another east in Vladivostok, and one in the south, in Sevastopol, Crimea. Krym nash (Crimea is ours), Russians say. An acknowledgement of this would be a powerful inducement for Russia to ratchet down unacceptable (to us) behavior such as the bomber base in Venezuela and tampering with elections. But it’s hard to see much changing given the nasty state of politics in D.C. Mr. Trump passed on an opportunity to meet with Mr. Putin at the G20 in Buenos Aires in November because, I think, he felt politically constrained. Perhaps it’s worth remembering how President George H.W. Bush dealt with Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet Union upon its demise. He had a relationship with Mr. Gorbachev. They met many times. He didn’t kick the Soviets while they were down. This is what we expect from presidents, not politics which handcuff them from moving forward on national security interests.

But Gutierrez Lopez, a single mother, has yet to leave the country after getting her deportation order in December. Instead, she took refuge on the grounds of a Maryland church that offered her sanctuary and a chance to remain in her adopted homeland with her children. The Cedar Lane Unitarian Universalist Church, located in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, offered Gutierrez Lopez an apartment to live in while a pastor from her local church in Fredericksburg, Virginia, cares for her children. She moved in on Dec. 10, the same day U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had ordered her to leave the country. Like Gutierrez Lopez, dozens of migrants are now believed to be sheltering in U.S. places of worship, according to migrant advocacy groups. U.S. immigration authorities are not prohibited from detaining people in houses of worship. But ICE has a written policy of not arresting anyone at “sensitive locations,” including schools, hospitals, rallies and churches, except in cases involving national security or when there is imminent risk of violence. Gutierrez Lopez was detained at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2005 after fleeing El Salvador because she said she feared for her life. Authorities released her and ordered her to appear in immigration court, but she chose not to show up on the day her case was scheduled. Instead, she began a new life as an undocumented immigrant in Virginia, she said in an interview on Wednesday, finding work in a restaurant and starting a family. U.S. President Donald Trump has tried to crack down on immigrants living illegally in the United States and has spoken out against those who do not appear at court hearings. Eventually, Gutierrez Lopez turned herself in to immigration authorities in 2014 and was regularly issued deportation stays and work permits until last month, when she was ordered to self-deport. She said everything changed when Trump took office. “Under the Obama administration, I only went to report in every year,” she said. “Under Donald Trump’s administration, I received an ankle bracelet ... It hurts my soul because I’m not a criminal.” During his candidacy and in the White House, Trump has pointed to crimes committed by illegal immigrants as evidence of the need for tough enforcement of immigration laws. But despite the reality of deportations, which increased to record numbers under former President Barack Obama, desperate people fleeing Central America’s endemic violence and poverty continued to push toward the southern U.S. border in 2018. Trump is demanding that $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border be included in any legislation funding government agencies, something Democrats in Congress oppose. The dispute has triggered a partial government shutdown that began on Dec. 22.

{"requested_url": "http://desertherald.com/the-buhari-dangote-conspiracy-against-nigerians-2/", "plain_text": "By Odilim Enwegbara  There is no need for a denial. Aliko Dangote and Femi Otedola are not partisan politicians; they don’t belong to any party and couldn’t have, therefore, been named members of the “APC Presidential Campaign Council.” But they could still perform more strategic roles as members of the “APC Special Advisory Council.” What’s in a name anyway? Nobody is fooled.  I have credible intelligence revealing why Dangote and Otedola have suddenly joined the Buhari presidential campaign. It concerns Dangote’s readiness to roll out billions of naira in campaign finance support.  There have been some last-minute deals which, if allowed to happen, would make Dangote among the 10 richest people in the world, and make Nigeria a Dangote incorporated entity.  What are these irresistible deals offered to Dangote? And why must Dangote carry Otedola along?  The two big deals involve the sale of the country’s four refineries to Dangote’s foreign business partners. This is to avoid anyone raising an eyebrow or fear that Buhari is selling such important assets directly to Dangote in exchange for partly financing his campaign.  The game plan here is that once the refineries are sold as scrap by the federal government, the so-called foreign owners would so run them down that the federal government would announce that it would be taking back these refineries. Once this happened, the next announcement from the same federal government would be that it has found Dangote and Otedola as the local buyers and who have what it takes to own and manage the four refineries. Eventually, the federal government would pretend as if circumstances were forcing it to hand them to the two at a little fee.  Otedola, it was gathered, will get two of the four refineries. And for him to focus on these deals, he was advised to quickly divest in Forte Oil Plc., which is debt-ridden.  The second irresistible deal is Ajaokuta Steel Company. The same strategy used in the sale of the refineries would be applicable in the sale of Ajaokuta.  Dangote, I learned, was also reminded how good Buhari has been to his business. In particular he was reminded how he enjoyed the lowest forex rates – they were far below official rates – which the presidency mandated the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to provide for him in the name of forex for Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical. That was besides the gas-for-fertiliser deal the Dangote Group and the OCP Group of Morocco signed in late 2016, which was facilitated by the federal government.  In return, the Buhari Campaign has asked Dangote to support Buhari’s re-election with some undisclosed billions of naira as campaign support.This request from Dangote is besides the N500 billion — I repeat, N500 billion — that has already been mapped out for vote buying: it is expected to buy as many as 25 million votes at N20, 000 for each vote.  There are two dangerous implications here.  First, with these deals Dangote may soon become Nigeria’s and Africa’s Rockefeller, the same man whose capability to buy over American politicians was able to destroy America’s capitalist system, as he turned America into his private empire. And with his complete access to the US federal government, not only did he create oil cartels, he went as far as creating monopolies across industries, which he used in destroying any form of competition and buying over those he couldn’t destroy, including all potential competitors. That this led post-war US’ de-industrialization and economic financialization explains why America is yet to recover and become a leading global manufacturing hub like Japan, Germany and recently China and India.  Second, like the same Rockefeller, Dangote could, on becoming so rich and so much involved in Nigerian politics and political campaign financing, literally decide who will be elected as federal lawmakers along with who will be elected governors of the 36 states and, of course, who will become Nigeria’s president.  With this newly handed political power by Buhari via this on-going game, Dangote would, apart from having his cronies populating the three tiers of government, including the judiciary, also ensure that his cronies head virtually all the ministries, departments and agencies of government including the police, the military, DSS, immigration, and of course the Federal Inland Revenue Service, customs, and the anti-graft agencies.  If Nigerians allowed Buhari to win and get these deals concluded, then, they would live to regret it, just as Americans are yet to free themselves from Rockefeller’s control of both America’s economy and politics. For instance, Dangote would be the person to control the country’s foreign policies and its trade policies. Above all, he would decide the country’s fiscal and monetary policies, given that it is his cronies who would be populating the country’s ministries of foreign affairs and finance. It also means that the CBN would be so under his control to the extent that he could decide from time to time who would be appointed the governor and deputy governors.  During the three weeks of top secret negotiations between Dangote and the Buhari Campaign headed by the powerful cabal, it was learned, there was intense fear that if Atiku was allowed to win the presidential election, which is increasingly becoming evident, the Dangote business built on government cronyism would suffer a terrible setback.  Starting with Atiku’s plan to restructure the country, there is the fear that a restructured Nigeria would make it extremely difficult for Dangote’s oil blocks to remain in his hands. But most important is the fate of Dangote Refinery which has been freely taking the South-South’s oil and gas simply in connivance with the federal government.  Dangote fears that an Atiku presidency will lead to privatising the four refineries and handing them to real serious investors. The new owners of the refineries will no doubt bring competition and force down high pump prices of fuel. With his refinery nearing completion, Dangote is planning to unleash high fuel prices on Nigerian consumers.  Maybe most Nigerians do not know that it is as a result of Dangote’s monopoly of cement that the commodity costs the highest in Nigeria. What about salt, sugar, flour, pasta, beverages, tomato paste, Indomie, and rice? Others are real estate, furniture, garments, motor spare part, tyre, battery, telecommunications, and SunTrust Bank secretly established in 2016. Dangote is the majority shareholder of the bank. Dangote’s plans, which Buhari’s cabal is excited about, is to soon put millions of small businesses in the country completely out of business.  But more dangerous is that he is about to join the GMO foods production. What this means is that, soon, you and I will begin to eat Dangote cancer-causing processed foods such as carrot, corn, rice, potato, orange, pineapple, papaya and cabbage. And Dangote’s political and economic power? No one can ever try to stand in his way without expecting to be crushed! There are Dangote police in most of our cities already.  The strategic sole aim of these businesses – including Dangote’s forthcoming retail business chain that will soon be seen littering Nigerian cities, known as Danmart – will put millions of our small retail business owners out of business. If this should be allowed to happen, it might no longer be difficult for him to also impose his planned monopoly prices on other petroleum products, petrochemicals and fertiliser.  In the meantime Obasanjo is alarmed. Also alarmed are other powerful generals who are already in possession of information about what is feared to happen to Nigeria should Buhari force himself on Nigerians through vote buying and outright election rigging.  Buhari’s re-election is like an atomic bomb that must not be allowed to explode in Nigeria. In particular, it would trigger ethnic and religious conflicts in Nigeria — with millions caught up in civil turmoil that will force them to head for neighbouring West African countries, other African countries and potentially Europe as refugees. However, there is already an agreement among world leaders that everything should be done to stop Buhari’s re-election in order to save Nigeria from internal disintegration.  It was on the basis of this frightening scenario that, as far back as July 2018, concerned world leaders agreed that the only way to avert such post-election ethnic and religious crisis in Nigeria is to not allow Buhari steal a second term. Those who had access to this global consensus know that has since sealed Buhari’s hope of being re-elected Nigeria’s president.  Because die-hard supporters of Buhari do not have access to this damning intelligence report on Nigeria, they are understandably still shouting “Buhari is going to win” the February 16 presidential election. Had they seen that report, or understood the fear that any attempt to declare him winner would instantly ignite revolts across the country – they could start in Port Harcourt and spread like wildfire to Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Kaduna, Onitsha, Ibadan, etc. –the die-hard Buharists definitely wouldn’t be shouting “Buhari must win”.  Understandably, Nigeria’s powerful retired generals such as Obasanjo, IBB, Gusau, Danjuma, and Abdulsalami Abubakar who are in possession of that report are doing everything to save Nigeria from a second civil war that could bring to an end the nation we all call ours. \n——————————————- \nEnwegbara, a development economist can be reached at basil_enwegbara@yahoo.com or at 07038501486", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "The Buhari-Dangote Conspiracy against Nigerians", "tags": "", "categories": "Political Mirror", "author": "Desert Herald", "sitename": "Desert Herald Newspaper", "image_url": "https://i2.wp.com/desertherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/buhari-dangote-9.jpg?fit=412%2C275", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9719082713127136, "responded_url": "http://desertherald.com/the-buhari-dangote-conspiracy-against-nigerians-2/", "publisher": "desertherald.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104025036-00076.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T04:29:55+00:00"}

All the hope and goodwill UConn engendered by that Nov. 15 win over Syracuse at Madison Square Garden has evaporated. After Wednesday night’s 76-68 loss at South Florida — South Florida! — UConn is 9-5 overall and 0-1 in conference. It has lost two in a row, three of its last five and four of its last seven games. It is 1-5 against “Major 7” competition, if you will.  Here are five takeaways from the loss to USF:  HERE WE GO AGAIN: The one promise this season held with Dan Hurley at the helm was that, if nothing else, the Huskies would play harder and not be as embarrassed as much. Those awful, head-spinning runs by opponents would be a thing of the past.  Well ... UConn is starting to revert to last year’s bad habits.  The Huskies were outscored 51-28 in the second half against Villanova. Over a 20-minute span from the end of the first half to near the end of the game on Wednesday night, USF outscored the Huskies 45-21. The Bulls, like Villanova, scored 51 points in the second half.  “When you have a couple of years of losing,” said Hurley, “it’s hard to have that player that’s been through it for a couple of years, that when stuff starts going sideways, has the ability to rally the troops and settle everyone down.”  This rebuild is gonna take a while, folks.  FRONTCOURT FOLLIES: We knew UConn’s relatively young, inexperienced frontcourt would be a potential big weakness this season. Never was that more evident than on Wednesday night.  Josh Carlton had two points and three rebounds and seemed to be lost in a fog most of the night, struggling even to catch the ball. Same with Sid Wilson, who had two points and two boards. Eric Cobb, who didn’t play a second against Villanova, got 15 minutes of run on Wednesday and, while he did grab a team-best seven rebounds, took just one shot — which he missed. Even little-used Isiah Whaley got in on the act, going scoreless with one rebound in four minutes.  Tyler Polley, a small forward, missed nine of the 10 shots he took, including all seven 3-pointers. He had exactly one rebound in 27 minutes.  Grad transfer Kassoum Yakwe, the team’s most accomplished shot-blocker, was out with a foot sprain, but he wouldn’t have made that much of a difference.  Such lack of production by the big men puts added pressure on the guards, but Hurley wasn’t about to absolve the latter of any blame.  “It’s not the bigs’ fault that the guards couldn’t stay in front of the ball, and we’re just getting driven and driven and driven,” he said. “Our guards, there’s a lot of pressure on them to play at a high level. But in that stretch, where it was eight and it was slowly dwindling, that’s when we need guys to make plays. Not at the end of the game when we’re down 12.”  TIMEOUT OF MIND: One thing Hurley doesn’t seem to like to do too much is call timeouts while his team is reeling.  “You can’t just keep calling timeouts,” he reasoned. “You can call the one timeout and try to settle things down, but at some point, you’ve got to kind of save one or two for the end, if you can, and do the best you can coming out of the timeout. And it wasn’t like the most prolific run (on Wednesday night). It was kind of a slow, paper-cut thing. It wasn’t like a flurry. It was kind of happening slowly and painfully.”  ROAD WEARY: Over the past two seasons, UConn is 2-10 in true road games. Over the past three years, 6-18. That’s a sign of a lack of toughness, a lack of rising up to the challenge in hostile territory. Even when it’s in front of a sparse — if occasionally spirited — crowd of a mere 3,429 on Wednesday night.  BEATA-BULL: The most disheartening thing about Wednesday night? USF really isn’t very good. Sure, the Bulls played better in the second half and are now 11-2. But they turned the ball over 20 times (UConn “only” had 13 turnovers, though it felt like more) and still don’t shoot very well from either 3-point land or the foul line.  USF simply played harder than the Huskies. Sounds like a cliche, but they just seemed to want it more. Look no further than LaQuincy Rideau, a 6-fot-1 point guard who had 25 points, eight rebounds (!) and three steals. Or Putman Science Academy product Alexis Yetna, who finished with 12 points and eight boards.  david.borges@hearstmediact.com", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "UConn men’s takeaways: This rebuild is going to take a while, folks", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "David Borges", "sitename": "New Haven Register", "image_url": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/77/62/43/16722162/3/rawImage.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9705246686935425, "responded_url": "https://www.nhregister.com/uconn/article/UConn-men-s-takeaways-This-rebuild-is-going-to-13506895.php", "publisher": "nhregister.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103224750-00075.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T00:40:45+00:00"}

In a Facebook post, Gandhi cited the report which claimed investments in the just-ended December quarter fell to a 14-year-low.

One is unable to handle the administration, the other is unable to understand the economy,\" the Congress president wrote in Hindi in a thinly veiled reference to Modi and Jaitley. \"One runs away fearing questions.

{"requested_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-border/u-s-activists-helped-migrants-in-mexico-during-border-clash-idUSKCN1OY01N?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "plain_text": "MEXICO CITY/TIJUANA (Reuters) - A group of U.S. activists opposed to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies helped migrants in Mexico during a clash with U.S. agents at the border on New Year’s Eve, and dispute their government’s account of the events. Late on Monday, about 150 migrants gathered at the border in Tijuana to try to enter the United States, according to the U.S. activists and a Reuters witness. After learning of a possible conflict, 11 U.S. volunteers who were in Tijuana headed to the border to provide medical assistance and document the events, said Lilith Sinclair, a spokeswoman for the group. The activists, part of a group known as the Border Support Network, have said they were banding together to counter what they view as the U.S. government’s violation of asylum seekers’ rights. They have also challenged the U.S. government’s position that agents deployed tear gas after coming under attack. “This attack on migrants peacefully seeking asylum was crippling, inhumane and unprovoked,” Sinclair said in a statement on Wednesday. The clash in Tijuana was the second incident in less than two months in which dozens of migrants tried to cross the border and were met with gas. The activists were not present for the entire confrontation, but did not witness any provocation by migrants in the time they were there, Sinclair, a 24-year-old from Portland, Oregon, said in an interview. When Sinclair arrived, she saw a small group near the border fence, trying to tell agents they planned to seek asylum. She then saw agents deploy tear gas. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency said it could not immediately respond to a request for comment, citing a backlog due to the U.S. government shutdown. The CBP previously said agents launched smoke, pepper spray and tear gas known as CS gas only after migrants threw rocks. “This is among the lowest levels of response we can give,” said Joshua Wilson, vice president of the San Diego Border Patrol Union. “A rock is deadly force.” A Reuters witness did not see migrants throwing rocks. The Associated Press reported that rocks were flung after tear gas was deployed. The CBP said on Wednesday that an internal investigation of the use of CS gas on Dec. 31 was underway. On Thursday, the Mexican government requested a full investigation. ANTI-FASCISTS Formed in November in response to the migrant caravans that drew Trump’s ire, the activist coalition includes self-described anti-fascists and advocates for causes such as indigenous rights and water access, Sinclair said. Some members met through protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline and a police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. Mario Osuna, Tijuana’s secretary of municipal development, and a spokesman for the foreign ministry said they had no information about the group. Mexico’s immigration institute did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Under Mexican law, U.S. citizens may undertake voluntary work for up to 180 days without a visa. In mid-November, the group opened a safe house in Tijuana, housing about 25 volunteers at a time, most from the United States, said Evan Duke of Seattle, one of the organizers. The Border Support Network is funded largely by individual donations, Sinclair said. The group mobilized quickly after receiving word of the clash, heading out with warm clothes, medical supplies and water, said Duke, 45. He stayed behind to support volunteers from the safe house, adding that the activists had not transported migrants to the border or otherwise instigated the incident. Another activist, Nathaniel Dennison, a 34-year-old documentary filmmaker based in Virginia, said the mood at the border was “hopeful and peaceful until border patrol acted on asylum seekers, unprovoked.” Dennison said he was struck by three “plastic pellets.” The CBP says it does not deploy rubber bullets but does use pepper balls, a round rubber projectile containing pepper spray. Erick Hernandez, a 24-year-old Salvadoran who tried to enter the United States, said American volunteers helped bridge the language gap at the border. “They spoke with the American side,” he said. “We asked them for a little bit of respect for the children.” Reporting by Julia Love in Mexico City and Mohammed Salem in Tijuana; additional reporting by Kristina Cooke in San Francisco and Lizbeth Diaz in Tijuana; Editing by Tom Brown", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "U.S. activists helped migrants in Mexico during border clash", "tags": "", "categories": "Homepage", "author": "Julia Love", "sitename": "Reuters", "image_url": null, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.972989022731781, "responded_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-border/u-s-activists-helped-migrants-in-mexico-during-border-clash-idUSKCN1OY01N?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews", "publisher": "reuters.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103224750-00075.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T00:48:44+00:00"}

Ellie Yarrow-Sanders, 26, has not used her bank accounts or mobile phone since she disappeared with son Olly Sheridan six months ago.  Her estranged partner Patrick Sheridan, 45, has renewed his appeal for information.  He begged Miss Yarrow-Sanders to let Olly have a \"normal childhood\" not a life \"on the run\".  Olly is at the centre of a family court dispute between his estranged parents.  Miss Yarrow-Sanders disappeared with Olly in July a few weeks before she was due to give evidence in a \"critical\" family court hearing, according to lawyers.  A judge raised the alarm in December and urged anyone with information to come forward.  Mr Justice Williams, who oversaw a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London, said he was gravely concerned.  Family court hearings have been staged in private and journalists were barred from identifying relatives involved.  Mr Justice Williams said he has now lifted the identity bar in the hope that publicity will help find Olly and Miss Yarrow-Sanders.  He said the family members from Basildon in Essex could be named and photographs published.  Essex Police are also searching and have urged anyone with information to get in touch.  \"I hope that Ellie sees sense and comes forward so that this can be sorted out and Olly can have a normal childhood, not living on the run,\" Mr Sheridan said.  \"My boy needs both of his parents in his life and not to live a life undercover, hidden away from his family and the rest of the world.\"  He said Christmas was \"unbearable\", adding: \"Please, if any members of the public who might have seen Olly or have any information, call the police.\"  Lawyers representing Mr Sheridan said Miss Yarrow-Sanders had \"gone underground\".  Staff at law firm Irwin Mitchell said Miss Yarrow-Sanders had not used her bank accounts or mobile since disappearing with Olly.  A spokeswoman said Miss Yarrow-Sanders's mother travelled to Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, at around the time Olly vanished.

{"requested_url": "https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/what-happened-levi-bellfield-west-15615141", "plain_text": "The name 'Levi Bellfield' still haunts Londoners - and indeed, the entire nation.  Since the serial killer was convicted of the murders of 22-year-old French exchange student Amélie Delagrange in Twickenham, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell in Hampton, his name has continued to appear in the media.  Serving three life sentences, he has also been convicted of the murder of 13-year-old schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who disappeared from Station Road in Walton-on-Thames in 2002.  The former nightclub bouncer, dubbed the 'Bus Stop Killer' for his choice of hangout, is thought to be responsible for countless sexual assaults, rapes and murders.  Prowling the streets of West London, the West Drayton-based rapist spent his evenings waiting at bus stops and dark alleyways, stalking girls and young women who passed, and approaching them in his van.  If they dared reject his advances he would explode in a fit of violent rage and attack them with hammers or baseball bats.  Fathering 11 children, he had a string of partners and wives, often at the same time. Ex-girlfriend Jo Collings has spoken out since his arrest in 2004, claiming he raped her repeatedly, using her as 'target practice' for his night time ventures.  She once found a bin bag in Bellfield's shed filled with a balaclava, a kitchen knife, and a magazine with the faces of blonde models scratched out.  Bellfield's daytime exploits involved driving around in his car with a gang of violent thugs, and using his employment as a car-clamper to blackmail legally-parked drivers into paying him money.  Although locked up for life, Bellfield has managed to get his way back into the headlines. Here are just a few of the reasons he's stayed in the limelight.  The payout for a prison assault  Bellfield's name first returned to headlines in a storm of media fury amid fears the killer could receive a payout after he was attacked in prison.  Bellfield was eventually awarded a taxpayer-funded compensation sum of £4,500 in 2014 after he was hit in the back of the head by prisoner Albert Willett, who used a makeshift weapon.  The incident allegedly took place in the communal kitchen of the maximum security prison HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire.  Willett was jailed in 2008 for the murder of father of two Balbir Matharu, who challenged the killer as he attempted to steal the radio from his car.  Claiming prison staff should have protected him, Bellfield fought Ministry of Justice lawyers for three years before they were finally forced to admit liability.  The MoJ said it was \"hugely disappointed\" by the judge's decision to award damages to the murderer.  The Milly Dowler confession  In 2016 police reported Bellfield had admitted responsibility for the brutal rape and murder of schoolgirl Milly Dowler for the first time.  Bellfield had refused to give evidence at his trial and repeatedly denied killing the teenager. Her family released details of the confession, which came as a result of police investigations into whether Bellfield had an accomplice.  Milly's family said of the confession: \"The effect of this information has been devastating for a family which has already had to endure so much.\"  In a shocking twist, Bellfield released a statement two days after the alleged confession, claiming he had made no such admission, and challenging the police to prove what he had said.  His solicitor wrote to Surrey Police requesting a tape of the alleged confession. According to Bellfield, he was being formally questioned by police about other murders he was suspected to have committed before the tape recorder was turned off and he was informally asked about Milly Dowler.  DCI Colin Sutton, whose memoirs from the investigation into Bellfield have been used as the basis for ITV's new drama Manhunt starring Martin Clunes, said:\"I am almost lost for words on this.  “He has been toying around with the police and also the victims’ families, particularly the Dowlers. It is even beyond the cruel, wicked games that I know he was capable of.\"  The Islam conversion  Now calling himself Yusuf Rahim, Bellfield converted whilst in prison. He was one of thousands of prisoners allegedly becoming 'convenience muslims' in order to have access to extended rights and better conditions.  A newly Muslim inmate, Bellfield now has access to better food, more time out of his cell, and is excused from work duties to attend prayer meetings.  Prison bosses have seen a surge in religious conversions, with the extra free time making it easier for dangerous criminals to form gangs.  Bellfield's letters to pals have been signed from his new name, Yusuf Rahim.  The Daily Star reported that Bellfield had been targeted, alongside fellow serial killer Ian Huntley, by Muslim extremists looking to extend their gang influence over the prison.  The Russell murders confession  The team of lawyers working for Michael Stone - who was convicted of killing Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter Megan, and found guilty of the attempted murder of her second nine-year-old daughter Josie - claimed in 2017 Bellfield had admitted to the murders.  The team said Bellfield had made a detailed confession to a fellow prisoner, describing his encounter with Lin and her daughters, his attack with a hammer, and his motivation for the murders, including details that were not in the public domain.  An eye witness has also come forward with evidence she saw Bellfield near the crime seen shortly after the time of the murders.  Stone has launched two failed appeals since his conviction in 2001.  His imprisonment has become the topic of hot debate, with a panel of forensic experts on a BBC2 documentary claiming no forensic ties had ever connected Stone to the crime scene, and that it is likely there was another man there.  Lin Russell was walking with her her daughters down a quiet street near their home in Chillenden, Kent, on the way home from a swimming competition when they were attacked in 1996. They were tied to a tree, blindfolded, and beaten to death with a hammer.  Despite sustaining horrific injuries, Lin's oldest daughter, Josie, survived the attack. She spent a year learning how to speak again had to have a titanium plate put into her head.  Bellfield has denied both the murders and told the BBC that he didn't make the confession.  The 'Bellfield eats better than most out there' story  Bellfield clawed his way back into the limelight in 2018 after a letter released details of his fine dining behind bars. Bragging to his friend, he told him he 'most likely eats better than most out there.'  Facing prison for the rest of his life, the killer spends his time scoffing rump steak, legs of lamb and roast beef.  Funding the meals himself, his breakfast is a feast of 'Poached eggs, kippers, toast and honey, washed down with a pot of coffee.'  He added details of how he obsessively lines up his belongings, telling the recipient of the letter 'Everything has to be in place neat and tidy.'  When he's not too busy eating, Bellfield entertains himself with his own TV, PlayStation, X-Box and sound system.  The child sex grooming gang allegations  At the end of last year papers exploded with the news of Bellfield's alleged involvement in a paedophile gang which groomed young girls. The gang has reportedly never been brought to justice and some members are still at large.  In December 2017 Debbie Weissang, the former child sexual exploitation manager at Hillingdon Council in Bellfield's home of West London, sent a report to the Met Police which linked Bellfield with six other men accused of rape, paedophilia, and grooming.  While Bellfield has been locked up for good, she expressed 'deep concern' about the potential risk to other children, since the other six will not serve life sentences.  Weissang claimed the men targeted and groomed underage girls, who were often from children's homes. The paedophile gang is said to have used the date rape drug GHB and assaulted girls in Bellfield's one-bedroom Hanwell flat, making use of a room dubbed the 'raping room' by the predators.  Victor Kelly, who was convicted of exchanging drugs for sex with a 12-year-old, and Suraj Gharu, who was convicted of having sex with a 14-year-old from Hillingdon Council children's home, have both been named as alleged members of the gang.  Detectives involved in the murder cases of Amélie Delagrange and Marsha McDonnell had long suspected that Bellfield was part of a paedophile ring.  ITV Drama Manhunt  Levi Bellfield is due to become a household name yet again as ITV has announced its new drama Manhunt, starring Martin Clunes.  The new ITV drama will follow the work of Metropolitan Police detective DCI Colin Sutton (Clunes), who vigilantly pursued Levi Bellfield after he was assigned to Amélie’s case.  Based on Sutton's personal memoirs, the first episode starts with the discovery of Miss Delagrange's body near Twickenham Green.  Bellfield will be played by Celyn Jones, who has previously appeared in television shows such as Shameless and Catastrophe.  The three-part series starts on January 6 at 9pm, with the remaining episodes showing on consecutive nights on January 7 and 8.

{"requested_url": "https://bizwatchnigeria.ng/declining-sales-stock-price-slip-yet-apple-doesnt-know-what-is-causing-its-descent/", "plain_text": "Apple is in deep trouble. With a ten percent drop in its stock price on the day and low sales forecast in China, the technology behemoth is facing a tough quarter ahead.  Samsung, the largest conglomerate in South Korea, is also struggling to deal with low sales. As smartphones users feel less compelled to acquire new models, satisfied with older versions, smartphone manufacturers could continue to see a decline in sales throughout the years to come.  On January 2, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, wrote in a letter to the investors of the company that the firm’s projected revenue is expected to be lower than its initial expectation.  Cook wrote:   Based on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. While it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. Due to the ongoing trade war and the unresolved tension between the two countries, the overall demand and popularity of Apple products in China declined in recent months.  Similar to the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, the economy of China, affected by the poor performance of its stock market, has weakened throughout 2018. The slow rate of growth of the Chinese economy, as well as the conflict between local conglomerates such as Huawei and Western authorities, are said to have contributed to the decline in sales of Apple products.  Cook said:   China’s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. Within merely few hours, the stock price of Apple plunged from $158 to $142.5, by nearly 10 percent.  The steep sell-off of Apple shares comes from the company’s belief that the root issue that caused the company to struggle in the past quarter is the increasing tension between the U.S. and China.  However, if the trade war is the driving factor of Apple’s declining sales and it remains uncertain whether a comprehensive trade deal will be established by March 1, investors cannot possibly expect the performance of the company in China to improve in the short-term.  Apple Doesn’t Understand the Real Issue  As The Verge social networks columnist Casey Newton said, many analysts have pointed towards the high specifications and strong performance of Apple’s previous mobile phone models as the major contributing factor to the company’s short-term struggle.  For the first time, users are finding it challenging to justify an upgrade from the previous model (iPhone X) to iPhone XS.  “This was the first year in five that I didn’t upgrade my iPhone. Two reasons: – iPhone X was really, really good, and battery life is still great – The 2018 models were functionally identical to the iPhone X,” Newton said.

Nearly 50 dioceses and religious orders have publicly identified child-molesting priests in the wake of the Pennsylvania report issued in mid-August, and 55 more have announced plans to do the same over the next few months, the AP found. Together they account for more than half of the nation's 187 dioceses.  The review also found that nearly 20 local, state or federal investigations, either criminal or civil, have been launched since the release of the grand jury findings. Those investigations could lead to more names and more damning accusations, as well as fines against dioceses and court-ordered safety measures.  \"People saw what happened in these parishes in Pennsylvania and said, 'That happened in my parish too.' They could see the immediate connection, and they are demanding the same accounting,\" said Tim Lennon, national president of the board of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP.  The recently disclosed accusations date back six or seven decades in some cases, with the oldest from the 1910s in Louisiana. Most of the priests were long ago removed from ministry. An AP examination found that more than 60 percent are dead. In most cases, the statute of limitations for bringing criminal charges or suing has run out.  Nevertheless, advocates say exposing molesters nearly two decades after the scandal first erupted in Boston in 2002 is an encouraging step, in part because it gives some victims a sense of vindication after decades of official silence or denials. Also, it could increase pressure on dioceses to set up victims' compensation funds, as the church has done in Pennsylvania already. And it could result in the removal of molesters from positions outside the church that give them access to children.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Wamsi Mohan maintains at Neutral, price target lowered from $220 to $195. Baird's William Power maintains at Outperform, price target lowered from $230 to $185. Wells Fargo's Aaron Rakers maintains at Market Perform, price target lowered from $210 to $160. KeyBanc Capital Markets' Andy Hargreaves maintains at Sector Weight. Rosenblatt Securities' Jun Zhang maintains at Neutral, unchanged $165 price target. Tigress Financial Partners' Ivan Feinseth. Loup Ventures' Gene Munster and Will Thompson. Shares of Apple hit a new 52-week low of $142.81 Thursday morning and were down 8.54 percent at the time of publication.  Wedbush: 'Jaw-Dropping' Guidance  The Street was mostly expecting a certain degree of softness from Apple but the company's Wednesday guidance implies a \"jaw-dropping\" 8-percent top-line miss, Ives said in a research report. In addition, the guidance announcement is \"clearly Apple's darkest day\" and a defining moment for CEO Tim Cook, he said.  Apple has two options moving forward, the analyst said:  Maintain the course with no pricing changes and hope the next iPhone release will result in large-scale user upgrades. Enact significant price reductions ahead of the next iPhone launch to generate new demand in China. BofA: China Deterioration Worse Than Expected  Bank of America downgraded Apple's stock in 2018 based on anticipated weakness in China, Mohan said in a research report. But Wednesday's guidance revision suggests demand for iPhones in China \"deteriorated materially\" over the past two months.  Looking forward, the Street is likely to continue revising estimates lower, which will pressure Apple's stock, the analyst said.  Baird: Shares Attractive For Long-Term  Apple's guidance announcement is \"clearly disappointing\" given the company's reputation of hitting the December-ending quarter guidance, Power said in a note. Yet Apple stock is now trading at around 12.8 times estimated calendar year 2019 EPS, or at just 10.6 times when adjusting for cash. This compares to the stock's historical average of around 14 times and is approaching prior troughs near nine times forward earnings.  The current multiple could prove to be attractive for long-term investors, the analyst said.  Wells Fargo: 3 'Derivatives'  Apple's guidance could trickle over to three segments of its supply chain, Rakers said in a note:  The iPhone XS and XS Max was a key driver in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)'s growing modem business. Apple accounted for 60-80 percent of Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO)'s wireless segment revenue. Smartphones as a whole represent around 35-40 percent of total NAND Flash and DRAM bit consumption, with Apple alone accounting for 15 percent or more of total bits consumed. KeyBanc: Not Just China Problems  Apple highlighted weakness in China, but the company's problems extend beyond Asia, Hargreaves said in a note.  Apple's \"aggressive\" price increases to the iPhone in 2018 coupled with minimal differentiation in the new models prompted many users to either hold off on upgrading their phones or trading down their devices, he said. There is little reason to expect these trends will improve in Apple's favor in the medium term, which implies \"soft\" iPhone results are likely to continue, the analyst said.  Rosenblatt: Cautious On March Quarter, 2019  Apple's March-ending quarter is likely to come in short of normal seasonality, with an estimated 39 million iPhone units shipped for the quarter, Zhang said in a note. The company could end up shipping 10 percent fewer iPhones in calendar 2019 vs. 2018, the analyst said.  Tigress Financial: Buying Opportunity  The weakness in Apple's stock represents a buying opportunity for not only Apple but many of its component suppliers, Feinseth said in his daily newsletter. His bullish stance stems from signs of Apple customers spending \"more than ever\" on services within Apple's ecosystem.  Apple is rumored to be preparing the launch of an \"Apple Prime type of subscription\" that would combine music, cloud storage, AppleCare and even a video streaming platform, he said. This would give Apple direct exposure to monetize 750 million iPhone users and supports \"significant upside\" in Apple's stock from current levels, in Feinseth's view.  Loup Ventures: The 'Healing Process' Starts  Apple attributed most of its guidance revision to China-related woes, but the Asian country only accounts for 15 percent of Apple's total revenue, Munster and Thompson said in a blog post. Apple made a mistake in assuming the consumer reaction to a 23-percent increase in the iPhone average selling price in 2018, according to Loup.  Apple needs to rebuild investor confidence, and the \"healing process\" could start with Apple's December-ending quarter earnings and guidance, Munster and Thompson said. If the March-quarter ending revenue guidance at the midpoint translates to revenue growth that is better than the negative 5 percent that will be reported in the December-ending quarter, then investor confidence will improve, they said.

Some absolutely massive gigs will take place across the capital over the next 12 months, with music lovers of all tastes catered for.  We're taking a look at some of the highlights of Dublin's live music calendar.  Let us know what show you can't wait for this year.  Post Malone, 3Arena, February 14  What better way to spend Valentine's Day than in the company of the loving ballads of Post Malone? It would certainly be a romantic night out with a difference if you're attending this show with your significant other.  Ennio Morricone, 3Arena, February 15  Ennio Morricone turns 90 on February 15 and you can celebrate this milestone with the legendary conductor and composer when he comes to the 3Arena next month.  Shawn Mendes, 3Arena, April 13 & 14  Shawn Mendes has featured on Forbes “30 Under 30”, Time Magazine’s “Most Influential Teens” and has been recognised by ROI Influencer Media as #1 Most Influential Teen across all social media platforms. He's also know for his music, which fan can hear in all its glory at the docklands in April.  The Spice Girls, Croke Park, May 24  They're back! But will the Spice Girls still be a force to be reckoned with without vocal powerhouse Victoria Beckham, who has opted out of the reunion? We'll find out when they open their world tour at GAA HQ in May.  Kodaline, St Anne's Park, May 31 & June 1  We can't recall there being a gig in St Anne's Park before but it's certainly a lovely spot to stand and listen to some of the Swords rockers soaring hits.  Fleetwood Mac, RDS, June 13  Staying true to form for internal strife, Lindsey Buckingham is sadly no longer part of the band after the rest of the band told him \"You Can Go Your Own Way\" last year. But with Mike Campbell and Neil Finn in to fill his shoes, this should still be a cracking show.  Bon Jovi, RDS, June 15 & 16  Bon Jovi have somehow remained popular for over 30 years - if that doesn't illustrate the power of living on a prayer, then nothing will.  Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, Malahide Castle, June 16  He may be in his fifties now but Noel Gallagher appears intent on not letting up on the sibling rivalry. After Liam played a storming set at Malahide last year, it was perhaps inevitable that Noel would bring his High Flying Birds to the same venue this summer in an attempt to outdo the younger Gallagher.  Westlife, Croke Park, July 5 & 6  They're also back! And having already proved they can survive the departure of lyrical powerhouse Brian McFadden, the three Sligo lads and Bertie's son-in-law will no doubt find the comeback trail a breeze when they reunite on the Croke Park stage this summer.  Ariana Grande, 3Arena, September 22 & 23  Ariana Grande has released three platinum-selling albums, surpassed 18 billion streams, nabbed four Grammy Award nominations and landed eight hits in the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart - and she's still only 25! The singer brings her Sweetener world tour to the 3Arena in September for two sold-out shows.  A-Ha, 3Arena, October 29  It's 35 years since THAT video for Take On Me was released - and it's still amazing. But can the trio still hit those high notes? We'll have to wait until October to find out.  Other shows we can't wait for this year:  The Game, The Helix, March 7 Nicki Minaj, 3Arena, March 15 Michael Buble, 3Arena, June 6 & 7 The Cure, Malahide Castle, June 8 Backstreet Boys, 3Arena, June 11 Elton John, 3Arena, June 12 & 13 Paul Weller, Trinity College, July 4 New Order, Trinity College, July 7 Damien Dempsey, Iveagh Gardens, July 6 Villagers, Iveagh Gardens, July 12 Burt Bacharach, Iveagh Gardens, July 20 Foo Fighters, RDS, August 21", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "11 Dublin concerts we can't wait for in 2019", "tags": "Noel Gallagher,Nicki Minaj,Paul Weller,Victoria Beckham,Brian McFadden,Spice Girls,Trinity College,Westlife,Croke Park,Sligo;Noel Gallagher;Nicki Minaj;Paul Weller;Victoria Beckham;Brian McFadden;Spice Girls;Trinity College;Westlife;Croke Park;Sligo", "categories": "What's On", "author": "Mark O'Brien", "sitename": "Dublinlive", "image_url": "https://i2-prod.dublinlive.ie/incoming/article15203923.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Westlife-in-concert-0-collins.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9662390351295471, "responded_url": "https://www.dublinlive.ie/whats-on/11-dublin-concerts-2019-15627577", "publisher": "dublinlive.ie", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103192509-00074.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T21:31:34+00:00"}

{"requested_url": "https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/03/vacancies-mississippi-legislature/2465362002/", "plain_text": "Here's some of the buzzworthy quotes coming out of the Mississippi Legislature this week. Dustin Barnes/Clarion Ledger The 2019 Mississippi Legislature convenes Tuesday with at least three vacancies due to state lawmakers being elected judges in November and another lawmaker will join the Court of Appeals in February. Vacancies in the House: 3 Reps. Adrienne Wooten, D-Jackson; Willie Perkins, D-Greenwood; and Brad Touchstone, R-Hattiesburg, were elected judges and required to give up their legislative seats in the 122-member House. Wooten was elected as a Hinds County Circuit judge. Perkins was elected as a chancery judge in Leflore, Quitman, Tallahatchie and Tunica counties. Touchstone was elected a Lamar County Court judge. Under current state law, if a vacancy occurs in a calendar year in which the general election for state legislators is held, the governor has the discretion whether to call a special election to fill the vacancy. Secretary of State spokeswoman Leah Rupp said Thursday the office hasn't received a writ from the governor setting a date for special elections to replace the lawmakers. Also, another lawmaker, Rep. Cory Wilson, R-Madison, will leave in February to assume a seat on the Mississippi Court of Appeals. Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Wilson to the Court of Appeals to replace Kenny Griffis who was appointed by Bryant to the state Supreme Court. Griffis will replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Bill Waller Jr. who announced last year he is retiring Jan. 31. Also, there is still a question whether Rep. David Myers, D-McComb, will be back in the Legislature for the full session. Myers, a member of the U.S. Army Reserves, was deployed in 2017 to a year-long stint in Irag. He has said he would be back for some of the 2019 legislative session, but was unsure if he would be redeployed. Myers has said he will seek reelection. House members running for higher office in 2019: At least two House members are running for higher office this year. Jay Hughes, D-Oxford, is running for lieutenant governor and Mark Baker, R-Brandon, is running for attorney general. Senate vacancies: 0 Senators running for other offices in 2019: Senator Billy Hudson, R-Hattiesburg, has announced he won't seek reelection this year. Also, Sen. Buck Clarke, R-Hollandale, has announced he is running for state treasurer. and Sen. Michael Watson, R-Pascagoula, has announced he is running for secretary of state. Factoid: Mississippi Legislature consists of 122 House members and 52 senators. They are elected from districts and serve four-year terms. The job is part-time. Most Mississippi lawmakers receive about $40,000 to $50,000 a year in salary, per diem, reimbursements and other payments. The 2019 legislative session is scheduled to convene at noon Jan. 8 and go to April 7, but it is likely the session will end before April 7.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Mississippi Legislature has several vacancies, others running for higher office", "tags": "", "categories": "news", "author": "Jimmie Gates", "sitename": "Mississippi Clarion Ledger", "image_url": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/10/17/PJAM/1a3f5fb1-1003-4d2c-b68a-b26bd3552b43-wooten.jpg?crop=749,432,x0,y152&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9721363186836243, "responded_url": "https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/03/vacancies-mississippi-legislature/2465362002/", "publisher": "clarionledger.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103192509-00074.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T21:39:15+00:00"}

It was the first time Apple cut its revenue outlook in nearly 20 years.  Shares fell by nearly 10 percent during after-hours trading Wednesday into Thursday morning.

Apple stock was trading for about $144 a share shortly before lunchtime on the East Coast on Thursday.  In all, Apple has lost more than $350 billion in shareholder wealth in just three month’s time.  Hassett said we should expect more announcements like Apple’s moving forward.  “The Chinese economy is slowing in a way that I haven’t seen in a decade.

In 2014, MDOT began the program with nine parking sites along the I-94 corridor in southwest Michigan. \n   This expansion is part of a federally funded Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant awarded collectively to eight Mid America Association of State Transportation Officials (MAASTO) states: Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. \n   By using TPIMS, drivers can monitor parking availability and make better-informed parking decisions as they near the limit of their federally mandated hours of service.

Well, he played 24 minutes against the Winnipeg Jets on New Year’s Eve, second to Darnell Nurse on the Oilers’ back-end, and the Jets are a Stanley Cup contender. Even with seven defencemen in Edmonton and three also hurt — Oscar Klefbom, Kris Russell and Andrej Sekera — the rookie Jones might not be returning to Bakersfield anytime soon. Usually, there’s a burst of adrenaline and good play when someone is called up from the minors, but there’s been no fall-off with Jones. “I see a helluva player … there’s something uncoachable here and that’s calmness under fire,” said Oilers coach Ken Hitchcock, who had the left-shot Jones on the right side when he came up from the AHL, but now has him on left with the right-shot Adam Larsson. “When you see Caleb under hard pressure, he makes a calm play and that’s hard to teach. You either have it or you don’t and that’s a good quality, one that he can carry with him the rest of his hockey life. “I think (assistant coach Trent Yawney) would prefer that Caleb stay on the left side for now rather than flip-flop him so he can work with him there. But, he’s a great addition for us.” Jones has averaged 18 minutes a night in his seven games and scouts around the league are starting to notice. Certainly, the Jets got an eyeful in the most recent game and if they have to trade a forward, say, Nikolaj Ehlers, for cap reasons to sign wingers Patrik Laine and Kyle Connor to big bucks this summer, maybe they would be looking at Jones, whose stock is definitely on the rise.

That hasn’t changed even though Harrison’s American Top Team teammate Amanda Nunes knockout out Cyborg on Saturday in the co-main event of UFC 232.  \"I'm really happy for Amanda, but part of me -- my villain is gone now, kind of,\" Harrison told ESPN. \"That's always been the difference between me and (fellow Olympic judoka and former UFC women’s bantamweight champion) Ronda Rousey. She never wanted to fight Cyborg. I was always like, 'I can't wait to fight Cyborg.'  \"The next day, I don't want to say it affected me, but I was a little crestfallen. The hardest part is, the trajectory of my career probably just changed, and I didn't do a damn thing, you know? I was sitting in a hotel room when everything changed.\"    UFC 232 took place at The Forum in Inglewood, California. With the win, Nunes took Cybor's UFC women's featherweight title. Nunes also holds the UFC women's bantamweight belt.  With the loss, Cyborg has only one UFC fight left on her contract with that promotion. Harrison’s hope seems to be that when Cyborg’s contract expires the PFL will sign her and match up the two.  Cyborg’s knockout loss was her first defeat in 10 years and just the second setback of her career. That lengthy winning streak is the reason Harrison still believes a fight with Cyborg makes sense.  \"I still think it would be awesome to fight her,” said Harrison. “One loss in 10 years doesn't make her a dud. She's still a complete wrecking machine. That was the greatest women's fight of all time, and it kind of pisses me off it was overshadowed by so much stupidity and drama last week. I think the only thing that makes sense for her right now is a rematch with Amanda, but of course I would still fight her. No matter what, I would fight her.\"  Harrison has won all three of her fights by way of stoppage. I am a freelance writer who has covered a wide variety of topics over the years.

{"requested_url": "https://www.dailynews.com/2019/01/02/paul-george-has-37-points-as-thunder-spike-short-handed-lakers/", "plain_text": "LOS ANGELES — As Paul George, the star the Lakers once could have had, went off, the Lakers themselves looked frightfully thin on standouts. That was the short summary of a 107-100 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, an at times tense and exciting game that slowly drummed down to disappointment as the Lakers lost their third game in the last four without LeBron James. The best the Lakers had was Brandon Ingram, who keyed second- and third-quarter runs with 17 points, 11 rebounds and five assists, but went cold in the fourth quarter. Ingram missed his first six attempts of the final frame, only sinking a shot in the last minute when the result was well set. Likewise, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who got off to another explosive start with 18 first-half points, wound up with 25 in the game after cooling in the second half. Even if it was a predictable result, there was insult added to injury, as George led all scorers with 37 points. The 28-year-old, who spurned the Lakers last summer in free agency, wrapped up his night in the last two minutes with a dunk followed by a powerful flex, perhaps letting some steam off from tension that built throughout the evening.  For all the adoration George received during his visit last year, as Lakers fans set themselves to woo the Palmdale native, on Wednesday it was paid back in boos. Staples Center fans booed George when he was introduced. They booed him when he touched the ball. When he got his third foul just nine minutes into the game, a brief Bronx cheer arose as George complained to officials, followed by another chorus of boos. It didn’t take long for the Thunder to adapt to the role of antagonists: Russell Westbrook picked up on it after he tumbled on a dunk attempt, then threw a fit when no foul was called against McGee. George poured fuel on the fire minutes later, slapping the backboard with both hands on an alley-oop from Westbrook and drawing a technical foul for the gesture. From there, the duo didn’t hold much back: After a second-quarter sequence when George hit a tough jumper and drew a foul against Lance Stephenson, Westbrook performed his own rendition of Stephenson’s air guitar celebration.  Russ did Lance's celebration in front of him, winked and blew a kiss 😂 pic.twitter.com/hcERQkJIRm   — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) January 3, 2019  The two Southern California natives had officially become villains. Even though Westbrook struggled through an ugly shooting night (3 for 20), he still managed a triple-double (14 points, 16 rebounds, 10 assists). An already banged-up Lakers squad got even thinner during the game: Kyle Kuzma headed to the locker room before halftime with a lower back contusion and didn’t return. It left the Lakers without their top two scorers (James and Kuzma) and their top two assist men (James and Rajon Rondo). The offense often looked toothless. The most worrisome stretch came in the fourth quarter, when the Lakers didn’t score for a stretch of more than five minutes. It included four straight missed free throws, underscoring that the Lakers were just 19 for 32 from the stripe.

The student group called Business Leaders in Christ sued the University of Iowa last year after the school deregistered the club when it discovered that the group believes in Biblical marriage.  The Justice Department filed a \"Statement of Interest\" saying the university violated the students' rights.  The statement reads: \"Plaintiff Business Leaders In Christ ('BLinC') complied with the University's policy for registering as a student organization, including its Human Rights Policy prohibiting discrimination. Nonetheless, the University deregistered BLinC—and denied it full participation in the campus community—because the University decreed that BLinC's Statement of Faith might be 'unwelcoming' to certain students.\"  The University acknowledges that the Christian group readily agreed to amend its constitution to welcome LGBT members and leaders. However, the school took issue with the group's statement of faith, which states that \"sexual relationships\" should exist only \"between a man and a wife in the lifelong covenant of marriage\" and that \"every person should embrace, not reject, their God-given sex.\"  The University of Iowa found the group's religious views \"unwelcoming\" to LGBT people.  The Justice Department argues that the University of Iowa violated the group's rights.  \"In the United States' view, the Court should grant summary judgment for BLinC because the University's deregistration of BLinC 'without justification' violated BLinC's constitutional rights,\" the statement said.  The government also reasserted its commitment to protecting freedoms on campus.  \"The United States is resolutely committed to protecting First Amendment freedoms and to ensuring, as Congress has directed, that public 'institutions of higher education . . . facilitate the free and open exchange of ideas.'\"", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "Justice Department Defends Christian Club Discriminated Against by U of Iowa", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Emily Jones", "sitename": "CBN News", "image_url": "http://www1.cbn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/media/standard/images/uofiowa_si.jpg?itok=ox-cZPNu", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9484629034996033, "responded_url": "http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/january/state-department-defends-christian-club-discriminated-against-by-u-of-iowa", "publisher": "www1.cbn.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104025036-00076.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T06:16:36+00:00"}
{"requested_url": "https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/news-opinion/carbon-tax-costs-leo-varadkar-13810811", "plain_text": "There's only one difference between a carbon tax and ordinary tax….the former has the word carbon before it.  Apart from that it’s another run-of-the-mill levy designed to make money and, as always, hit the poorest hardest.  The claims by our Tory Boy Taoiseach a carbon tax has less to do with raising revenue and is more about changing behaviour will not wash with most.  They remember how the “temporary” Universal Social Charge was supposed to be an emergency measure only to discover it has morphed into another level of income tax.  Back then it was a case of fleecing the public to save the banks, now Leo wants to screw families and commuters to save the world.  That’s not to say the planet is not in peril because of climate change, it is, but hammering the least well off with more tax is not the way to go about it.  The chaos on the streets of France over increased fuel prices is no doubt a stark reminder to him of what can happen when you push people too far.  The water charge protests which almost brought down the Government and levelled Labour will be on Leo’s mind. Still, the leader of a party which threatened to cut off drinking water to families supposedly fretting about the quality of air is something to behold.  After the last Budget there were claims by environmentalists there was a missed opportunity for Ireland to do its bit to prevent global warming.  But it could just as easily be described as a failed chance to make it more difficult for older people and the poor to heat their homes with coal and turf.  Meanwhile, the Moneypoint power station, which is temporarily offline, burns two million tonnes of coal annually. That’s a lot of carbon but where’s the tax?  The problem for Leo and the Irish Tories is when it comes to taxation and fairness they are not trusted by a section of society. The €14.3billion back tax from Apple sitting in a bank account which the Government refuses to touch is a case in point. You’d buy a lot of carbon credits with that.  Incidentally, Ireland has spent €120million since 2007 on carbon credits – greenhouse gas allowances – to plug the emissions gap.  While the Taoiseach wants to penalise us into burning less fossil fuels, he appears to have an aversion to burning things, especially bank bondholders.  Before Christmas it was revealed a group of Anglo Irish Bank bondholders are to be paid €267million despite promises from former Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny they would not get a cent.  Documents recently uncovered by investigative journalist Ken Foxe reveal how the Government considered a special tax system for the top executives of multinational corporations, which would see them pay a flat rate of 30% while most of their workers were hit with 40%.  Had it come to pass it would have been among the most generous tax schemes in the EU but the plan had to be abandoned after the Attorney General said it might breach EU laws on State aid.  Even the British Tory party wouldn’t dare try a scam like that.  This amounted to a separate, secret and more lenient tax regime for an elite, wealthy 5% by the same Government which now wants to hammer people with a carbon tax whenever they heat their home or use their car.  Is it any wonder there are serious misgivings about any new tax when the public know that when it comes to Fine Gael the wealth of the few takes precedence over the wellbeing of the many?  In its current form all a carbon tax would do is punish people driving to work when they have no alternative.   In many other EU states public transport is subsidised – in Luxembourg it’s free – while here fares   continually rise and the entire bus fleet is fuelled by dirty diesel.  As for the pretence that electric cars are the future, they might be if drivers had a means of charging them.

In Drogheda, where I live, which has a population of more than 50,000, I know of two charging points and they are at the local Lidl store, so what would be the point in investing in an electric car?  To add to the hypocrisy, the vast bulk of the electricity which might power such vehicles is still generated by fossil fuels and will be for the foreseeable future.  If it is all about changing behaviour, as Varadkar claims, he might change his own and put a real plan in place to allow the public to reduce emissions instead of hitting them with a tax to reduce their income.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Pat Flanagan: 'The poor can't pay the price of Leo's new carbon tax'", "tags": "Pat Flanagan,Anglo Irish Bank,Apple,Conservative Party,European Union,Fine Gael,Labour,Revenue,Leo Varadkar,The Budget,Environment;Anglo Irish Bank;Apple;Conservative Party;European Union;Fine Gael;Labour;Revenue;Leo Varadkar;Pat Flanagan;The Budget;Environment", "categories": "News Opinion", "author": "Pat Flanagan", "sitename": "Irishmirror", "image_url": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/politics/article13810820.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_I190103_200029_3024538oTextTRMRMMGLPICT000171913553o.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9748567342758179, "responded_url": "https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/news-opinion/carbon-tax-costs-leo-varadkar-13810811", "publisher": "irishmirror.ie", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104072922-00077.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T10:22:34+00:00"}
{"requested_url": "https://www.romper.com/p/the-bird-box-challenge-is-more-offensive-dangerous-than-the-internet-realizes-heres-why-15647668", "plain_text": "At the very end of 2018, one of the most hotly anticipated Netflix movies was released and quickly became a cult hit. Bird Box stars Sandra Bullock in a post-apocalyptic hellscape in which seeing supernatural forces incites people to believe their worst fears are coming true, leading most to die by suicide or other forms of inflicted violence. Therefore, Bullock and her co-stars must wear blindfolds so as not to be influenced by the \"monsters,\" a concept which the internet has now created a challenge out of. However, the Bird Box Challenge is far more offensive and dangerous than many people may realize. As a debriefer, the whole concept of the Bird Box Challenge is that people perform everyday activities â€” as benign as eating breakfast to as potentially lethal as driving a car on the highway â€” all while, you guessed it, wearing a blindfold. Though it's not exactly abnormal for people to create jokes and memes and games out of pop culture, this challenge in particular is really raising eyebrows as it is not only insensitive to people who have eyesight impairment, but The Guardian reported the consequences can be very, very severe. Enough so that Netflix itself had to issue a statement warning against participating in the challenge. The streaming service posted to Twitter, saying: \"Canâ€™t believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE. We donâ€™t know how this started, and we appreciate the love, but Boy and Girl have just one wish for 2019 and it is that you not end up in the hospital due to memes.\" On social media, some users are posting videos of themselves and friends trying to do things while blindfolded, and the tasks are at times extremely dangerous. One such video shows an individual trying to drive a car down the highway with a blindfold on while his friend laughs in the passenger seat, another shows someone trying to navigate their way through the dark and running into a parked car, while yet another shows a father and his two kids running around the house bumping into things while wearing cloths over their eyes. The challenge has even scaled to social media stars doing full YouTube videos trying to navigate their entire days blindfolded, The Verge reported. Though to some the challenge may just be seen as another innocuous joke, it really isn't. Aside from the fact that in many cases, someone's personal safety or, even worse, the safety of innocent bystanders (as would be the case on the highway, or in public) is being put severely at risk. There is absolutely no reason, ever, to operate a vehicle or any other kind of machine blindfolded â€” no matter how funny it may seem to you, your friends, or the internet. On top of that, the challenge is just generally insensitive given that there are people in the world who are living with visual impairments, and they navigate through their every day lives without being able to see. However, these individuals take precautionary measures to ensure their safety, like utilizing service animals and going through years of training and therapy to live safe and healthy lives. Disregarding the safety and oneself of others â€” especially in such an extreme way â€” is not funny. It is not cute, and it is not a ploy for social media fodder. It is unintelligent, it is mindless, and it needs to stop ASAP, no matter how many likes and RT's you may have to forego.", "published_date": "2019-01-03", "title": "The 'Bird Box' Challenge Is Both Extremely Offensive & Dangerous", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Brianna Wiest", "sitename": "Romper", "image_url": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/1/3/a8dbecd5-3eae-449e-9d7a-ccd5bde350a8-screen-shot-2019-01-03-at-35024-pm.png?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9729570150375366, "responded_url": "https://www.romper.com/p/the-bird-box-challenge-is-more-offensive-dangerous-than-the-internet-realizes-heres-why-15647668", "publisher": "romper.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190103192509-00074.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-03T22:38:53+00:00"}
{"requested_url": "http://www.pattayamail.com/ourcommunity/thailands-eastern-seaboard-back-future-238758", "plain_text": "On Friday, 14th December, the British Chamber of Commerce Thailand (BCCT) hosted a multi-chamber networking event at the Royal Varuna Yacht Club. Before the event, the BCCT organized a seminar to discuss the future of the Eastern Seaboard (ESB) and Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). Greg Watkins, Executive Director of BCCT, was the moderator and he introduced the presenters who were: * David Nardone – Group Executive, Industrial and International, WHA Industrial Development PLC & Vice President AMCHAM Thailand. * Graham Macdonald MBE – Director, Macallan Insurance Broker Co Ltd; Senior Adviser PKF; Honorary Adviser to: BCCT, SATCC, South African embassy, Rugby School Thailand, English for All. * Peter Malhotra – Managing Director, Pattaya Mail Publishing Co., Ltd.  * Jim Howard – past-Managing Director, Katoen Natie Sembcorp, EOC Polymers & SGS. The aforementioned were all on the original BCCT ESB Group which was founded in 1998 and Graham Macdonald was the first Chairman. Needless to say, all of them have seen many changes over the last 20 years. David Nardone started the evening off with a presentation on how the ESB had grown over the last couple of decades and how he expected this to continue. David showed statistics from the automotive industry which showed just how far the ESB has come since the early 1990s. The ESB was responsible for the first industrial clusters for certain exports, e.g. automotive, electronics and steel plus many others. It was also the first place in Thailand to integrate all the infrastructure for many different kinds of industry as well as launching the region’s inaugural energy and petro-chemical complex at Maptaphut. He also pointed out that private investment was more than five times that of the government but was the first to point out how vital the infrastructure was to the existence of the ESB and thereby the EEC. Reverting to the automotive industry David showed how almost continuous growth has taken it from producing just over 300,000 cars in 1999 to almost 2 million last year. This then showed how the ESB and EEC could offer a first class destination which also provided an experienced, skilled workforce to potential investors – especially when you throw in the special incentives offered for setting something up within the EEC. There are 12 targeted industries for the EEC but anything will be considered. The twelve are: next generation automotive, smart electronics, medical & wellness tourism, agriculture &biotechnology, food for the future, robotics & mechatronics, aviation, logistics, biofuels & biochemicals, digital. Also, national defence and human resource & educational development will receive special consideration. Once everything is in place, the recent quote from Dr. Kanit Sangsubhan, Secretary General Eastern Economic Corridor Office of Thailand was shown as it summed up the whole project, “With the EEC development, Thailand will move up the global value chain towards becoming a value-based economy. The project is expected to kick start economic growth through new industrial and urban development, jobs creation and heavy public-private infrastructure investment.” David then handed over to Peter Malhotra who spoke about the human side. He reminded people that Pattaya was nothing more than a little fishing village fifty years ago and that Second Road was just a dirt track. He has seen the development grow exponentially since then – some of it good and some of it not. However, this was definitely the place to be in Thailand if you wanted to continue with progress. Nonetheless, it was vital the human element was considered by those who were planning the industrial and urban growth of the region. The educational system is old fashioned and must be restructured. He stressed the importance of vocational training which will give opportunities for young people to get better paid high skilled jobs. “The EEC is great for business and we are looking forward to the day when all these wonderful plans become a reality. But I do encourage business enterprises to invest in vocational training centres too. It will not only be good for your business, but you will also ensure that the next generation of Thailand’s work force will be as knowledgeable and skilled, comparable to the best in the world.” Jim Howard concurred with Peter and added that the planning and creation should be monitored at all times. Too often, elsewhere in South East Asia, greed has taken over and promises broken – to the detriment of all concerned but especially those whose lives and hopes had been dashed. Graham Macdonald summed up by agreeing with everything that his fellow panellists had said. He said that he believed a lot of the basic infrastructure was already in place but more was needed, particularly when such projects as the expansion of U-Tapao and the Sattahip Commercial port were so close to being awarded. He also worried about where all the skilled labour was going to come from as unemployment in Thailand is hardly at an all-time high. The evening ended with a Q & A session and a vote of thanks being given by Greg Watkins.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Thailand’s Eastern Seaboard: Back to the Future - Pattaya Mail", "tags": "", "categories": "Our Community", "author": "Pattaya Mail", "sitename": "Pattaya Mail", "image_url": "http://www.pattayamail.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1326-BCCT-27.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9722127914428711, "responded_url": "http://www.pattayamail.com/ourcommunity/thailands-eastern-seaboard-back-future-238758", "publisher": "pattayamail.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104072922-00077.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T10:27:50+00:00"}
{"requested_url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2019/01/02/how-will-the-real-estate-market-perform-in-2019/", "plain_text": "It seems timely to take a look at the real estate cycles in years past and project what the market is likely to do in 2019.  No one I know has a crystal ball that they can use to see the future with absolute clarity. But thanks to Steven Thomas, local real estate broker and economist, we have some data we can refer to and extrapolate from to try to predict how the market will behave this year.  There is an annual cycle, the data show. We start each year with a low point for both inventory of homes for sale and demand for homebuying. The inventory usually gradually builds up until about Labor Day, then slides toward the holidays to the year-end low.  Our historical data show that demand ramps up more quickly, with a sharp increase from Super Bowl Sunday, then gradually continues to increase until about Memorial Day, at which point, it begins to taper off for the remainder of the year.  So, generally speaking, demand is at a high for the first five months of the year, then people get busy with kids’ graduations, vacations, and other distractions, which skid into the holidays, which now start at the end of summer. You have seen the Christmas decorations in Costco in August, right?  Inventory, however, starts out slowly, then keeps building until the end of summer. Maybe because sellers think that everyone wants move in the summer. Actually, more people are buying in the winter and spring.  And even though we have about 59 percent more inventory now than this time last year, and there were about 24 percent more pending sales last year, the cycle should follow the same pattern.  This increase in inventory and drop in demand has flipped us from the strong seller’s market at the start of 2018 into a slight buyer’s market as we start 2019.  This impact can be seen in the average days on the market, which has gone from 65 days on average last year to 127 days as of the beginning of 2019. That’s double from last year. For home buyers, this means you have more choices, more time to kick the tires, run the numbers, and get your loan even partially underwritten before you make an offer. You actually have time to go look at the house more than once, for more than five minutes, before you submit an offer. You’ll also probably be the only offer on the table. Multiple offers on the same home are no longer the norm.  For home sellers, this means put your house on the market the Thursday before Super Bowl Sunday, which this year falls on Jan. 31. You’ll have it staged to perfection, take professional photos, and you’ll price it right at market value, and anything else you can think of to stick out for potential buyers.  What’s going to happen to home prices?  Despite the turning tide in supply and demand, the Orange County median home price peaked in May and September at $740,000 – up from a 2017 peak of $710,000.

Presented by AstroTurf, prior winners selected this year’s winners among the only set of college football awards that recognize the most outstanding position coaches. App State becomes just the third Group of Five program to be represented among the 11 winners of the defensive back coaches award. Gasparato and Brown will receive their award and be recognized during the American Football Coaches Association Convention in January. The other finalists were the defensive backs coaches from Mississippi State, Notre Dame and Miami. With Gasparato coaching App State’s safeties and Brown continuing to coach the cornerbacks as a first-year defensive coordinator in 2018, the Mountaineers (11-2) didn’t give up more than 19 points in any of their wins, all of which had double-digit point differentials. App State, which ranks fourth nationally at 15.5 points allowed per game, set a Sun Belt Conference record with only 20 defensive touchdowns allowed in 2018 and tied for first place nationally with only eight passing touchdowns allowed. Led by the “Legion of Boone” secondary, the Mountaineers intercepted 17 passes to rank 11th nationally, with safety Josh Thomas, safety Desmond Franklin and cornerback Tae Hayes picking off four passes apiece. One apiece came from cornerback Clifton Duck, safety Austin Exford and safety Kaiden Smith. App State also ranks in the top 10 nationally in fourth-down defense (No. 1), defensive passer rating (No. 3), fewest passing yards allowed per game (No. 5), fewest yards allowed per pass attempt (No. 5), fewest total yards allowed per game (No. 6) and fewest first downs allowed (No. 7). According to FootballScoop, Appalachian State was one of just two teams nationally to have twice as many defensive interceptions as touchdown passes allowed.

Stanforth highlighted that the city had completed “another successful year.”  “I’m proud of all our department heads for maintaining the valuable service they provide to our citizens while husbanding taxpayer money, and continue to give the citizens the service they deserve,” he said.  He added that 2018 continued the momentum of previous successful years with providing services, paving streets and continuing code enforcement work.  “As with the success of previous year’s paving project, it could not have been complete without the additional tax revenue the citizens have entrusted us with,” he said.  And 2019 will be a planning year, the mayor stated, with paving for Rombach Avenue, updating of the traffic signals and a waterline replacement.  Water Superintendent Rick Schaeffer was praised for this work in navigating the disputes in regards to the contract between the city and the Army Corps of Engineers. Stanfordth also praised Landfill Superintendent Mike Crowe and his staff for their work with the recycling programs and maintaining smooth operations.

Ranveer Singh plays the role of an underdog rapper from the streets of Mumbai who becomes a big name in home-grown rap and Hip Hop. On Friday, director Zoya Akhtar released a teaser of Gully Boy, which had no dialogues and the scenes were set to the song Asli Hip Hop rapped by Ranveer Singh. Going by the quick moving snippets viewers can understand that Ranveer's character faces resistance from his family and society to fulfil his dream. But he does get what he aims for in the end. Alia Bhatt and Kalki Koechlin play a crucial role in the development of Ranveer Singh's character graph in the film. The full trailer of Gully Boy will release on January 9 (Can't wait). Till then watch this announcement video: Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy is partially inspired by the journey of Rapper Divine, who earlier told PTI that he's looking forward to the film's release. Speaking to PTI, Divine had said: \"The film is inspired by the Mumbai hip hop community and it's amazing how far we have come in the last few years. With this film, it seems the journey has only begun.\" Rapper Raja Kumari, who has twice collaborated with Divine (City Slums and Roots), liked the announcement video and commented: \"Goosebumps.\" Gully Boy also stars actor rapper Chaitanya Sharma (better known as SlowCheetah) and it will open in cinemas on February 14.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Ranveer Singh And Alia Bhatt's Gully Boy Trailer Announcement Is Rocking.

In the final non-league game before Southeast Yosemite League resumes next week, the North senior scored a career-high 40 points on Thursday as the Stars beat Garces at home, 70-59. The game could be a precursor of a Central Section Division III playoff matchup next month. “It was so loud in here with a lot of people in here. It felt like a playoff atmosphere,” Ferguson said. “It was a big win. We had some adversity, but we came back from it. It was a huge win. I feel it every game, especially if I hit a few shots.” That’s exactly what Ferguson did after connecting on six 3-pointers, making short jump shots and driving to the rim with authority. Garces took a 56-54 lead with a little more than four minutes remaining in the game on a layup by Isaiah Hughes, who scored team-high 21 points. North answered when Larry Atkerson scored on a put-back, however. From there, Ferguson scored 11 of the final 14 points for the Stars (7-9) during a 16-0 run to close things out. “Shannon is one of the premier players in the area,” North first-year coach A.J. Shearon said. “With his size and athleticism, he’s such a great attacking player. But when he shoots it like he did tonight, he’s really tough to guard. That’s what we come to expect of him. Maybe not 40, but he’s our leader.” North stormed out to a 19-11 lead after the first quarter but Garces cut the lead to four at halftime and Hughes scored the first eight points in third for the Rams (11-8). Nick Sill hit a 3-pointer as time expired in the quarter as Garces took a 49-48 lead. North outscored the Rams 31-11 in the fourth, however. “We’ve scheduled intentionally to rep these types of environments,” Shearon said of the playoff-like atmosphere and setting. “Credit to coach (Brian Dignan) for bringing his kids over here during the break and putting in a really good D-III battle here. This is exactly what we want, and that’s to be battle tested going into league and playoffs and hopefully have some experience for those environments.” Jack Hatten scored 12 points for Garces.

Trinity Ladies were accepted into Women’s Super League at the beginning of December, following a hugely-successful year in the Women’s Championship. And with his side now in the top tier of the women’s game, Hirst wants his team to start playing more games on Super League turf. “Everyone is eager to get going,” said Hirst, who will take his first pre-season training this Monday. “We played at Belle Vue once or twice last year and the girls loved playing on a Super League field and being in the changing rooms. “There was a buzz around and hopefully next year we will be able to do it more. “Some of the games will be live-streamed but for that to happen the games have to happen in a Super League ground. “That is one of the reasons why we will be playing more games at Belle Vue. “We have got a good three months pre-season to get in, it gives us plenty of time. “We are also hoping to get in at least two or three friendlies beforehand as well. “Players are going to have to get used to each other as well as me and how we have been playing for the last year. “The players will soon pick it up, it is nothing new really, just different terms and whatever else may be slightly different. “It is going to be a good three months getting to know everyone and being ready for the first weekend of the season in April.” Hirst also hopes that having another top-tier side in Wakefield will help to speed up any plans relating to a new community stadium for Trinity. He added: “I would love to say that us playing at Belle Vue would help with the stadium. “As someone who has been a Wakefield fan for many years, to see the club get a new stadium and if we could be a part of it - that would be ace but we will just have to wait and see. “I know that the club have been trying their best and tried their best to push for it. “It is a little bit out of our hands but it would be nice. “The club as a whole seems to be on a real high at the moment, with the signings that the first team has made and with the Ladies getting into Super League.\"", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Wakefield Trinity Ladies hoping to play more games at Belle Vue next season", "tags": "", "categories": "Sport", "author": "Ben McKenna", "sitename": "Wakefield Express", "image_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/http://editorial.jpress.co.uk/mastheads/NYWE-masthead-share-img.png", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9902978539466858, "responded_url": "https://www.wakefieldexpress.co.uk/sport/rugby/wakefield-trinity/wakefield-trinity-ladies-hoping-to-play-more-games-at-belle-vue-next-season-1-9518454", "publisher": "wakefieldexpress.co.uk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104025036-00076.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T07:15:44+00:00"}
{"requested_url": "https://wtop.com/food-restaurant/2019/01/6-restaurants-to-look-out-for-in-2019/", "plain_text": "WASHINGTON — The D.C. area’s restaurant bubble continues to grow, but it’s not bursting just yet. Close to 100 eateries opened in 2018 — from grand dining rooms to street-food stands — and 2019 is shaping up to be an equally exciting year for the taste buds.  What, exactly, is in the works? Washingtonian executive food editor and critic Ann Limpert shared six projects from local chefs that will open in 2019.  There, the 31-year-old James Beard Award finalist will “step onto a much bigger stage” with fresh pastas, homemade breads, pickled goods and a menu that changes daily.  “The really cool thing here is that most of the menu is going to be circulated around the dining room on trays and carts,” Limpert said.  “They’re even going to have a mobile oyster bar for table-side shucking.”  Emilie’s is expected to open in late 2019.  Adams Morgan will get a new place to dine and drink when the team behind the Michelin-starred Tail Up Goat opens its new restaurant, Reveler’s Hour. Limpert said the concept will be casual with a menu of pastas, vegetable dishes and wood-fired items. She expects it will also be a hot spot for wine lovers.  “Their sommelier, Bill Jensen, makes things really accessible and fun, and I think he’s a real star on the scene,” Limpert said.  Peter Chang is adding to his growing restaurant empire this year with a new outpost on Old Lee Highway in Fairfax, Virginia. Mama Chang will shine a spotlight on home-style Hunan and Szechuan dishes.  “And the cool thing here is that many of the recipes have been passed down through lots of generations of his family,” Limpert said.  Seasoned sommelier Brent Kroll and former Arroz and Requin chef Michael Rafidi are joining forces with two neighboring and collaborative projects in D.C.’s Navy Yard neighborhood.  Limpert said Radidi’s restaurant, called Albi, will focus on Middle Eastern-inspired fare; Kroll will head its wine program. Next door, Kroll will open a second location of his wine bar, Maxwell Park, for which Radidi will design the food offerings.  As if Nicholas Stefanelli wasn’t busy enough in 2018, the chef behind the Michelin-starred Masseria and the recently opened Officina (a three-story Italian market and trattoria at The Wharf) has another project in the works. This year, Stefanelli will open Philotimo, a Greek restaurant at Fannie Mae’s new downtown headquarters.  “He’s going to be importing specialty cheeses, wild herbs and olive oils from Greece, but he’s also going to highlight food and wine from all regions of the country,” Limpert said.  Similar to its Annandale, Virginia sibling, The Block in North Bethesda, Maryland will showcase an array of Asian foods in a food hall format. Limpert said the new location, designed to look like an Asian night market, will be much bigger than the first (more than 3,000 square feet bigger). Diners can expect a bar and several stalls serving street foods.  Read about more 2019 restaurant openings on Washingtonian’s website.  © 2019 WTOP. All Rights Reserved.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 746 points in the latest twist in a wild three months for markets.  Hopes for progress in the U.S.-China trade dispute, a strong report on the U.S. jobs market and encouraging comments from the head of the U.S. central bank about its interest rate policy all combined to cheer investors.  China’s Commerce Ministry said trade talks will be held Monday and Tuesday in Beijing, and investors will again look for signs the world’s largest economic powers are resolving their dispute. The tensions have dragged on for nearly a year, slowing business and dragging down stock indexes worldwide.  Meanwhile the Labor Department said U.S. employers added 312,000 jobs last month, a far stronger result than experts had anticipated. U.S. stocks have tumbled since October as investors worried that the economy might slow down dramatically because of challenges including the trade dispute and rising interest rates.  The stock market’s plunge also threatened to shake up the confidence and the spending plans of businesses and consumers. Some analysts said investors were acting as if a recession was on the horizon, despite a lack of evidence that the U.S. economy is struggling.  “It’s hard to square recession worries with the strongest job growth we’ve seen in years,” said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research for FTSE Russell.  Stocks rose even further after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank will be flexible in deciding if and when it raises interest rates. He added that the Fed is open to making changes in the way it shrinks its giant portfolio of bonds, which affects rates on long-term loans such as mortgages.  Until recently, the Fed had suggested it planned to raise short-term interest rates three times this year and next, and Powell said the Fed’s balance sheet was shrinking “on auto-pilot.” Wall Street feared that the Fed might be moving too fast in raising borrowing costs, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors.  The Fed’s interest-rate and bond portfolio policies “were at the top of the list of things we were concerned about, which is why the statement Powell made today is so supportive of the market,” Orlando said. “The Fed understands that what they attempted to communicate last month was inartful, that they didn’t get the right message across, and Powell tried to reset.”  The S&P 500 index climbed 84.05 points, or 3.4 percent, to 2,531.94, more than wiping out Thursday’s loss. The Dow rose 3.3 percent to 23,433.16 after gaining 832 during the afternoon. The Nasdaq composite jumped 275.35 points, or 4.3 percent, to 6,738.86.  About 90 percent of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange traded higher.  Stocks sank Thursday after Apple said iPhone sales in China are falling, partly because of the trade fight, and a survey suggested U.S. factories grew at a weaker pace. Technology companies took their biggest losses in seven years.  The U.S. and China have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods in a fight over issues including Beijing’s technology policy. Last month, President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to 90-day ceasefire as a step toward defusing tensions, but that failed to calm the stock market.  Technology companies, banks, health care and industrial companies all made strong gains. Most of the companies in those industries stand to do better in times of faster economic growth.  Smaller and more U.S.-focused companies did even better than larger multinationals. The Russell 2000 index surged 49.92 points, or 3.8 percent, to 1,380.75. Smaller companies have fallen further than larger ones in the last few months as investors got nervous about how the U.S. economy will perform in 2019 and 2020.  Stocks have whipsawed between huge gains and losses for the last few weeks after their big December plunge. Katie Nixon, the chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management, said investors will continue to react to the health of the economy, and to concerns about high levels of corporate debt as interest rates rise.  “We don’t expect that this will be the end to the volatility,” she said. “There’s mounting evidence we’re going to see a slowdown,” albeit not a severe one.  Bond prices also changed course and moved sharply lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.66 percent after it plunged to 2.55 percent Thursday, its lowest in almost a year. That helps banks, as higher interest rates allow them to make bigger profits on mortgages and other loans.  European shares also overcome losses from a day earlier, with Germany’s DAX gaining 3.4 percent and France’s CAC 40 rising 2.7 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 advanced 2.2 percent.  In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 2.2 percent. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.8 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 2.3 percent on its first day of trading in 2019 as technology and electronics makers slumped on Apple’s report that Chinese iPhone sales were slipping.  U.S. crude oil added 1.8 percent to $47.96 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was up 2 percent to $57.06 per barrel in London.  The dollar strengthened. It rose to 108.51 yen from 107.77 yen. The euro rose to $1.14 from $1.1391. The British pound moved up to $1.2740 from $1.2630.  Wholesale gasoline dipped 0.1 percent to $1.35 a gallon and heating oil added 1.6 percent to $1.77 a gallon. Natural gas rose 3.4 percent to $3.04 per 1,000 cubic feet.  In other trading, gold fell 0.7 percent to $1,285.80 an ounce and silver slipped 0.1 percent to $15.79 an ounce. Copper rose 3.1 percent to $2.65 a pound.  ____  Stan Choe contributed to this story from New York.

On December 30, 2018, at approximately 12:32 am, Washington County Sheriff’s Deputies notified the Maryland State Fire Marshal Bomb Squad to assist with the discovery of a suspected device. The device was located in the parking lot of the Quaker Creek Apartments. As a result of diagnostics performed by the Bomb Squad, it was determined that the device was a functional intact improvised explosive device. The Bomb Squad rendered the device safe and took it in to custody for evidence and assumed the investigation. No injuries or damage was reported as a result of the incident.  On January 4, 2019, the Maryland State Fire Marshal Bomb Squad executed a search warrant at 714 Hammond Street in Salisbury. As a result of the execution of the warrant, Michael Joseph Thorn (51) was taken into custody without incident and transported to Wicomico County Central Booking/Detention Center.

For years I have been a haphazard garden journaler, resulting in a pile of half-started notebooks, scattered collections of plant labels and lots of unfiled images.    My failure means I have to rely on memory, rather than evidence, a failing that guarantees each year I will put a spade through at least one pricey and dormant bulb.    Experts in behaviour change tell us that a resolution is destined to fail unless accompanied by a serious strategy. As my garden-journaling strategies have been about as successful as prime ministerial reshuffles I asked for help.     Anita Rayner, head gardener for Sydney Living Museums' Elizabeth Farm, Rouse Hill Farm and Vaucluse House, has time only for Instagram, which she says, \"is actually pretty useful for following flowering times year to year\".    She acknowledges that more information would be beneficial and jokes that the absence of journals for all three gardens is a bad habit she learnt from the former head gardener.    \"He took so much knowledge with him,\" she laments, \"we're still scrambling to catch up.\"      Rick Shepherd, head gardener at Retford Park, got serious about keeping garden notes when the National Trust took over the property in 2017. He came up with a system of double diaries. One is his planning diary, which operates like any other work diary, with reminders to return Robin Powell's call about garden journaling and order the mulch.    The other diary operates in the present and past tenses, listing the jobs completed, as well as notes about the weather and what is looking good in the garden. It's filled in every day, briefly but succinctly summing up the garden and its work patterns.    The only domestic gardener I know who religiously keeps a garden journal and has done for years is Sandra Ross, who swears by the Royal Horticultural Society's five-year garden journal. There is a double-page spread for each week of the month. It's divided into six columns, one for each of the five years plus a spare for extra notes, plans, ideas and dreams. There's a wish list section, where Ross lists the plants she hopes to find at Collectors' Plant Fair (April 6-7, Hawkesbury Racecourse, Clarendon). Each weekly entry is an opportunity to reflect on the garden's growth and change over the years.     Having considered the options, my 2019 strategy is going to be to use my work diary, which is always on-hand. I've allocate the notes pages at the beginning of every month to what's going on in the garden, what I've planted where and what I want to remember to do. So that's the seed planted; the next job is to nurture the habit.

{"requested_url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/northern-advocate/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503450&objectid=12183349", "plain_text": "Dirk Weishaupt's passion for acupuncture was sparked by \"a midlife crisis\". Rather than buying a sports car or dating someone half his age, he opted for a career change.  It was 2005, Weishaupt had been an optometrist for 30 years and was desperate for a new challenge. Stressed and suffering from headaches, he visited an acupuncturist to see if it would help.  \"He inserted a needle in my toe and the pain subsided almost immediately.  \"The experience completely changed the way I looked at the human body. I decided there and then that I was going to study acupuncture.\"  Within weeks, Weishaupt had signed up for a four-year bachelor degree at the New Zealand School of Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine in Auckland.  \"Going back to school as a middle-aged man was scary but exciting. It was also one of the best decisions I've ever made.\"  Originally from Germany, Weishaupt spent a year in Whangārei in the early 90s and returned for good in 1997.  Over the years he has become a familiar face around town and built long-lasting relationships with the locals.  \"Whangārei is a great community and I feel privileged to be part of it. The people here are wonderful. And Northland beaches can't be beaten.\"  Weishaupt knows many of his clients from his previous life as an optometrist, although his case load is more varied these days.  \"People seek acupuncture for all kinds of conditions – musculoskeletal issues, coughs, colds and flu, nausea, migraine, digestive problems, heart conditions. It can offer support for almost any ailment affecting the body or the mind.\"  Working with people who are trying to conceive, either naturally or through IVF, is also an area close to Weishaupt's heart.  \"There's no bigger satisfaction than helping a client achieve a positive outcome. I also work with women to help maintain a healthy pregnancy and prepare the body for childbirth.  \"Many people see acupuncture as a last resort when all other modes of treatment have failed. But early intervention can often prevent further complications.\"  Weishaupt typically sees anywhere between 30-40 clients each week, and this number is increasing all the time. This reflects a growing demand for acupuncture and other allied therapies, as New Zealanders embrace a more holistic approach to healthcare.  A 2004 paper from the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Complementary and Alternative Medicine and a 2010 peer reviewed study (by Pledger, Cumming and Burnette) both reported that 24 per cent of New Zealanders had visited a complementary therapist within the past 12 months, and it is likely that this number is now much higher.  With more than 800 acupuncturists practising in New Zealand, finding the right one can be something of a minefield. Acupuncture New Zealand, the country's largest acupuncture professional body, recommends prospective patients select an acupuncturist from their membership database to ensure the highest standards of care.  Although acupuncturists aren't currently bound by statutory regulations, Acupuncture New Zealand members meet and maintain stringent voluntary standards. AcNZ members have completed the equivalent of four years fulltime training in New Zealand or overseas.  To maintain their Annual Practicing Certificate, they are also required to complete 20 hours continuing professional development (CPD) education each year and hold a current first aid certificate.  Weishaupt found that adopting a different mindset towards the human body was one of the biggest challenges of retraining as an acupuncturist.  \"Western medicine is very clear cut in terms of right and wrong, black and white, whereas traditional Chinese medicine has a lot of grey areas and apparent contradictions.  ''Embracing that uncertainty was a huge learning curve and didn't come naturally at first, but now it's second nature.\"  One thing which has always come naturally, however, is Weishaupt's desire to make a difference to people's lives.  \"For me, happiness and fulfilment in life comes from a sense of belonging to the community, having a purpose and doing something worthwhile. Optometry and acupuncture are very similar in that sense.\"  Having the opportunity to learn and grow professionally is also a big motivator.  \"In traditional Chinese medicine, there is a saying, 'when the patient walks in the door, the teacher has arrived'. Each client is unique. The more people I treat, the more I learn. The more I learn, the happier I am. Becoming an acupuncturist has given me a whole new lease of life.\"", "published_date": "2019-01-05", "title": "Vision of holistic health sparked career change", "tags": "Northern Advocate", "categories": "Northern Advocate", "author": null, "sitename": "NZ Herald", "image_url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/giGl1xdr7V22J6qXEKgP2bf7r2w=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IHOBCH2I7RCYDDD366AKYU3INU.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9675623774528503, "responded_url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/northern-advocate/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503450&objectid=12183349", "publisher": "nzherald.co.nz", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190105020634-00083.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-05T02:11:55+00:00"}

Fermoy District Court head that James Heffernan (39) of Ballinlyna, Kifinane, Co Limerick told gardaí that they were \"sound as trouts\" on August 1, 2016 after he spent a night in custody following his arrest. Mr Heffernan appeared in court on charges brought following events relating to July 31/August 1, 2016. Judge Brian Sheridan found Mr Heffernan guilty of drink-driving on the Limerick Road in Mitchelstown on August 1, 2016. He disqualified him from driving for a period of three years and fined him €500. The former Labour Senator was also convicted of two common assault charges and one of assault causing harm to three members of the Force after he was arrested on July 31, 2016. He was also convicted of two charges of careless driving at Coolnave, Mitchelstown on August 1, 2016, and fined €400. At a sitting of the court in December Mr Heffernan had denied that he assaulted or spat at gardaí following his arrest when he was allegedly ejected from the festival. He maintained that any suggestion that he was \"kung fu kicking a guard in the back\" was completely false and that he was never abusive to gardaí. Gardaí told the court that Mr Heffernan was in an intoxicated state outside the venue and was seen kicking security barriers which fell on to the roadway. Gardaí had to take him into custody in Fermoy garda station for his own safety as he fell on barriers knocking them to the ground and was a \"social danger.\" Detective Garda Gerry Murphy said as they attempted to put Mr Heffernan in the garda van, he kicked Sgt Ger Quinn. He also spat at now-retired Detective Garda Jim Fitzpatrick twice. When they got to the station Mr Heffernan was aggressive and uncooperative. Garda Murphy said Mr Heffernan refused to take off his shoes. When they were being taken off he kicked Garda Trevor Sheehan into the mouth causing it to bleed. In his evidence at the previous hearing, Mr Heffernan said he was frustrated by the decision of gardaí to remove a miraculous medal from his neck whilst in custody. However, he insisted that the mood in custody \"was jovial and jocular\" and they spoke about \"garda pay and conditions\". He said his alcohol consumption consisted of whiskey and a few cans. Garda evidence had been that he reportedly told them he was after \"a whole heap of porter, whiskey and gin\". At a hearing of the court today, Judge Sheridan directed that a probation report be prepared in the case. He said that the evidence of the defendant was at variance to that of the gardaí and the security guard at the festival. The qualified primary school teacher will be sentenced on March 15.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Former Senator found guilty of assaulting gardaí after Indiependence music festival", "tags": "ireland;courtcase", "categories": "ireland", "author": "Friday; January", "sitename": "Irishexaminer", "image_url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/remote/media.central.ie/media/images/j/JamesHeffernanCourt2016_large.jpg?width=648&s=ie-895664", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9923987984657288, "responded_url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/former-senator-found-guilty-of-assaulting-gardai-after-indiependence-music-festival-895664.html", "publisher": "irishexaminer.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104185010-00081.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T18:54:27+00:00"}

{"requested_url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2813773-how-has-cristiano-ronaldos-departure-impacted-la-liga", "plain_text": "Cristiano Ronaldo was unveiled as a Real Madrid player in July 2009. Even though it was a Monday, 80,000 people turned up at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium to catch a glimpse of the star, which was more than the 62,467 fans who attended that year's UEFA Champions League final between Barcelona and Manchester United at Rome's Olympic Stadium. A further 10,000 disappointed fans—many of whom had queued for hours in dry, baking late-afternoon Madrid sunshine—were left outside the stadium when the gates closed at 8:40 p.m. The evening felt box office. Ronaldo didn't disappoint. Over the next nine years, he smashed all kinds of records, winning four UEFA Champions League titles and scoring 450 goals for Real Madrid. The club might never see a player like him again. Now that Ronaldo has gone to Juventus, it seems like something is lost. On the field, Real Madrid is struggling, as it trails Barcelona in the league by seven points. Attendances at the Bernabeu have dropped—only 55,229, for example, showed up for its last home game against Rayo Vallecano, on the day his old teammate Luka Modric was presented with the FIFA Ballon d'Or award. Real Madrid has been averaging 62,500 fans at home games this season, which is a falloff from an average of 65,824 fans per game last season. The average attendance for La Liga games, however, has increased by almost 8 per cent this season, as supporters enjoy the most competitive title race in years, with, for example, surprise package Alaves in the top five in the standings. \"It's inevitable after a superstar leaves a club—one who has had such an amazing period on the pitch with Real Madrid—that something is lost, but I don't think history will define this last six months as a period where La Liga has lost anything,\" says Gareth Balch, CEO of Two Circles, a sports marketing company. \"Commercially, and sport-wise, it has been very strong for the past numerous years, and that will endure for a number of years to come. \"While data suggests there is a lull in interest at the Bernabeu in attendances, and some consumption data of La Liga on digital properties, it's not something that will sustain. It's just a lull—a cyclical effect after having so many highs in recent years with Ronaldo and his Real Madrid team being so successful. You only have to look at Manchester United, and the torrid time they've had on the pitch in recent years and the continued success they have off the pitch to understand the economic landscape of sport now means that brands endure beyond a few years of difficulty on the pitch.\" Joris Evers, La Liga's Chief Communications Officer, argues that the league is greater than one man: \"Certainly Cristiano Ronaldo is a great player and he contributed a lot to La Liga and football in Spain. However, La Liga and the clubs that form La Liga Santander are bigger than a single player. The competition this season is very close and very exciting. La Liga has been working for the past years to promote the brand of the league as well as the clubs.\" Despite Ronaldo's departure, La Liga announced increases in its broadcast deals over the summer, with spikes domestically (15 per cent) and internationally (30 per cent) compared to the last three seasons, with almost €5 billion guaranteed from international rights over five seasons by MediaPro, starting next season. \"None of our broadcasting partners have brought up Cristiano's departure as an issue to us,\" says Evers. \"We're keen to further grow the La Liga brand and club brands to establish the same kind of notoriety the English Premier League enjoys, which is not leaning on individual star power.\" The Spanish league lags behind the English Premier League's bonanza broadcasting deals, and in terms of revenue, the Premier League is 86 per cent larger than La Liga, according to figures by Deloitte (h/t BBC). It's remarkable given the fact that La Liga is above the Premier League in UEFA's co-efficient rankings, with four Spanish clubs in the top 10 compared to two English clubs, and that the Spanish league has accounted for the last five UEFA Champions League winners and four of the last five UEFA Europa League winners. It is interesting, as Evers notes, that the Premier League has grown over the last decade despite the lack of stardust in its league. Unlike La Liga, it doesn't have a Leo Messi or an Antoine Griezmann, another recent Ballon d'Or finalist. The English Premier League hasn't, for example, had a Ballon d'Or winner since Ronaldo won the award as a Manchester United player in 2008, which was the last time the league even had a player on the podium. Football since then has been defined to a great extent by the Messi vs. Ronaldo rivalry. Both players—until this year's interloper Modric won for his exploits with Croatia and Real Madrid—have dominated the Ballon d'Or awards. Their standards—and incredible goal-scoring records—have made La Liga a compelling battleground, and have driven each other on. They have made the Barcelona vs. Real Madrid rivalry arguably football's greatest derby ahead of historical clashes such as Liverpool vs. Manchester United or Boca Juniors vs. River Plate. That storyline is petering out—with the exception of possible UEFA Champions League clashes—now that Ronaldo has left La Liga for Italy's Serie A. However, Evers is keen to raise the profile of the other 18 clubs in La Liga's premier division. \"A main mission of La Liga is to promote the broad league and to gain awareness for more clubs,\" says Evers. \"Barca and Real Madrid are global brands already. We want more clubs to have broad global awareness and for the league as well. That's a key part of our strategy. We admire how people in places like India, Indonesia and Africa can name multiple English clubs today. Depending on where you are, the list of La Liga clubs people can recall is two, three, maybe four. We need to make that a longer list.\" Real Madrid president Florentino Perez always had a frosty relationship with Ronaldo. He made a calculated risk in selling him to Juve, making a profit on the sale of him after nine years of service. Perez decided to bite the bullet and begin the regeneration of an ageing squad (a process that could accelerate next summer). Ronaldo turns 34 in February. Time waits for no man, and his returns will inevitably decline. However, we are seeing stars in other sports like Roger Federer and LeBron James excel in their mid-thirties. Commercially, though, Ronaldo's stock has never been higher, although that could change quickly depending on how the rape allegations made against him in October by Kathryn Mayora in German newspaper Der Spiegel develop, with a Las Vegas police investigation ongoing. He has denied the accusations. Despite the troubling story, Ronaldo has retained the support of his club, as well as many of his fans and sponsors. No other athlete, according to Forbes, makes as much on endorsements. He has hundreds of millions of social media followers. On Facebook, for instance, he has 120 million; La Liga has 49 million. As the face behind the portfolio of CR7 brands, Ronaldo's earning power—if we refer to the post-playing business career of Brand David Beckham—may not diminish significantly once he retires. \"If you look at all the greatest rock bands or movie franchises of all time, the 10th album or the 10th movie always does better than the first one or the second one,\" says Balch. \"With the familiarity and the depth of engagement that can only be accrued over time and over a career in a sporting context—or through a lifetime in terms of, say, a movie-making perspective—it's more lucrative at the back end of a career. \"Therefore, two years of Ronaldo at Juventus is going to beat the early years he spent at Manchester United every day of the week in terms of financial return Juve will get. It's a compound effect you get from the sense of belonging and following he builds up over the duration of a sporting career.\" In the summer of 2017, La Liga sensationally lost Neymar Jr. (another global sporting brand) to Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain. Last summer, it lost Ronaldo. The Spanish league will endure, though, without them. The skies did not, for example, cave in when the iconic basketball player Michael Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls in 1999. The NBA is stronger than ever. \"It's a chicken or egg scenario,\" says Balch. \"Do you become a big league because you have superstars? Or do you present the league well and superstars get born out of it? I think [the latter] is the greatest challenge for La Liga. They've had the most golden period they could ever have imagined—with two of the greatest footballers of all time playing at the peaks of their powers for the two biggest teams, creating the greatest rivalry for the last 10 years or so. It's made for commercial growth. \"But that didn't propel the league to a No. 1 position. It would show you that going and finding another Ronaldo isn't the only way to make the league the world's biggest league in the world. They need to market better and promote it in a way that drives global consumption. That requires a different approach. The next Ronaldo will come along cyclically. If you look back over the last 50 years there has always been great footballers playing in La Liga. The greatest players have always wanted to play at the Bernabeu or the Nou Camp.\"  Follow Richard on Twitter: @Richard_Fitz", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "How Has Cristiano Ronaldo's Departure Impacted La Liga?", "tags": "Soccer, World Football, La Liga, Real Madrid, Breaking News, Gevorg Hovhannisyan, Christian Ramsebner", "categories": "", "author": "Richard Fitzpatrick", "sitename": "Bleacher Report", "image_url": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/783/850/hi-res-dca15bf6e75d3dca6d4e0a2c106f7c42_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9716795086860657, "responded_url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2813773-how-has-cristiano-ronaldos-departure-impacted-la-liga", "publisher": "bleacherreport.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104104759-00078.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T10:51:28+00:00"}

The ceremony also witnessed the handing over of jerseys by the Deputy Ambassador to The Equalizer Gambia team.  In her welcoming statement, the regional Governor Madam Fatou Jammeh Touray expressed with delight to be part of the event and urged the volunteers to remain steadfast in their noble job of serving humanity.  This programme, she said, wold go a long way in improving the learning outcomes of the benefitting students.  She assured the volunteers of her office's support at all times and welcomed the Deputy Ambassador and his delegation to Mansakonko.  Lamin Fatty, the Master of the ceremony and a lead volunteer, said that Equalizer Gambia is an offshoot of The Equalizer Israel which was conceived by Mr Omar Keita during a month long fellowship in Israel through the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation (MASHAV) in May this year.  Also speaking, Omar Keita the mastermind of the program stated the Equalizer Gambia renders support to over one hundred students from five schools in the region through extra classes and sports activities. According to him, the program is a voluntary one and currently has over twenty volunteers ranging from staff at the regional education office to coaches, referees, and teachers within the region.  He noted that every participating school enjoys two hours of free tuition and sports activities on Saturdays and Sundays respectively.  He disclosed that plans are underway to include more schools in the program especially those that have requested to be part of it.  Delivering a statement on behalf of the Minister of Basic and Secondary Education (MOBSE), Mr. Musa Bah, the Acting Principal Education Officer, region 4 thanked Mr. Omar Keita and his team of volunteers for complimenting the efforts of his ministry and urged them to remain committed to this very important task they have set themselves.  The Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation (MASHAV) was founded in 1958 following a visit by the former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir to West Africa. The agency has since then offered long and short term trainings in numerous disciplines to three hundred thousand people in over one hundred and forty countries. One of MASHAV's founding principles was serving others and he is not surprised that Omar Keita has also decided to serve others through The Equalizer Gambia.. As a sign of appreciation, the Embassy donated hundred jerseys to The Equalizer Gambia team.  The ceremony was punctuated by singing and dancing by a cultural group.

{"requested_url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-democrats-stake-ground-far-090000815.html", "plain_text": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats are staking out ground that leaves them far from any deal to end the partial government shutdown. House Democrats on Thursday ignored a Trump veto threat and passed a two-bill package that would reopen all federal agencies without the $5 billion the president wants for a wall on the U.S. Mexico border. Trump claimed broad public support for building a wall or other barrier that Democrats called a waste of money. “The impasse is real and it is deep,” said Republican Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a close confidant of Trump and chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. He predicted a shutdown lasting months. On Friday -- the 14th day of a funding lapse that’s shuttered nine of the 15 federal departments and left hundreds of thousands of workers on furlough or working without pay -- Trump and the top leaders of both parties from the House and Senate will hold a discussion at the White House in an attempt to end the standoff. House Vote The meeting, the second this week, comes a day after Democrats took control of the House and elected Representative Nancy Pelosi of California as speaker. One of their first acts was passage of two bills, one to fund eight cabinet departments through September and the second to reopen through Feb. 8 the Department of Homeland Security, which is at the center of the border security battle. Almost all House Republicans stood by Trump on both bills. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his chamber won’t consider any measure that doesn’t have Trump’s backing, even though the Senate voted overwhelmingly in December to pass largely identical legislation before the president reversed course and announced his opposition. “We are sending them back exactly, word for word, what they have passed,” Pelosi told reporters shortly before the vote. “The president cannot hold public employees hostage because he wants to have a wall that is not effective.” Separating the Issues Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, New York Democrat, said Thursday the bills “separate the wall fight from the government shutdown -- you don’t have to have one, even if you can’t resolve the other.” “These are not Democratic bills; they were crafted in a bipartisan way by a Republican-controlled Senate Appropriations committee and a Republican-controlled Senate,” Schumer said. McConnell called the House vote “political theater, not productive lawmaking.” The Kentucky Republican said his chamber won’t take up the spending bills because they don’t contain spending increases for border security. As both sides continued to harden their positions, Trump made a surprise appearance Thursday in the White House briefing room with border patrol agents to make his case. “Without a wall you cannot have border security,” Trump told reporters. “It won’t work.” He left without taking questions. Offer Disavowed Vice President Mike Pence offered Democrats a compromise on Dec. 22, the first day of the shutdown, in which Trump would accept $2.5 billion for border security. Trump later disavowed the offer, saying he needed $5.6 billion for a wall. Senate Democrats in August backed $1.6 billion for border security, though they now say they’re unwilling to provide any more than the $1.3 billion approved last year for fencing. Progressive House Democrats urged Pelosi to stand firm and not provide any money for a wall. “We should not give in to extortion,” said Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin, whose district contains thousands of federal workers. “We have sent back the most reasonable and mild proposal to reopen the government” and Republicans should accept it, he said. Federal workers are bearing the brunt of the shutdown’s effects. More than 450,000 “essential” employees are working without pay, including law enforcement personnel, border patrol agents and airport screeners. These workers received paychecks at the end of December but will miss their next checks on Jan. 11 unless the agencies reopen. That could pressure lawmakers to resolve the dispute before next week. Another 380,000 employees have been furloughed without pay. For the public, the visible signs of the shutdown have come in the form of overflowing trash at national parks, closed museums in Washington, and a lack of guidance from the Internal Revenue Service as the first tax filing season begins under the new tax code enacted in 2017. Financial markets are flying blind as the Commerce and Agriculture departments suspended regular reports. The partial shutdown will cut U.S. economic output by about 0.1 percent every two weeks, Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Thursday.

Peninsula didn’t get off another shot before time expired.  “That’s what happens when you don’t play for two weeks,” Blazers coach Allen Thomas said.  Timberline hadn’t played since losing a nonleague game to Skyview on Dec. 20.  “Guys were out of shape,” Thomas added.  Both teams were impressively efficient from the field during the first half. Neither missed a shot in the first three minutes, as the Seahawks grabbed an early lead. Timberline shot 75 percent from the field and Peninsula 67 percent before halftime.  The lead changed hands five times during the second quarter, but the Blazers finished the half on a 13-4 run and went into the break up by 10. Campau, Joubert and Kayden Lacy each had a pair of buckets during the scoring outburst.  “Our guards do such a great job of beating their defenders, pump-faking and finding the open man,” Joubert said. “We play so well together.”  When Hicks and Lacy each scored within a minute of the second half’s start, Timberline took a 41-29 lead and looked ready to coast home.  But, Peninsula wasn’t having it.  “Their coach, Matt Robles, does a great job of staying poised through runs. That’s something I’ve always admired about him,” Thomas said.  The Seahawks (5-5) promptly fashioned a 10-2 run of their own, fueled by a dunk and a routine post-up basket by Kaleb Lichau, to cut the Blazers’ lead to seven by quarter’s end.  Peninsula showed its balance when four different players contributed to an 8-2 run that opened the fourth quarter. With the Seahawks within a point at 50-49, both Lacy and Campau fed Joubert for inside baskets that seemed to give Timberline enough breathing room.  But Roman Bockhorn, who finished with 14 points, then nailed a 3-pointer from the top of the key. With 17 seconds to play, Dane Jackson drove, looking to pass out to a shooter on the perimeter, but was fouled by Hicks and made two pressure free throws to send the game into overtime.  “Defensively, we didn’t have great on-ball pressure tonight, they got a lot of dribble penetration and found open shooters,” Thomas said. “That can set up an upset, but fortunately we got a couple of stops.”  Peninsula took the first lead of overtime on Cole McVay’s only basket of the night, splitting two defenders underneath.  Campau countered with a pair of free throws before Lichau gave Peninsula its final lead, scoring inside with 1:48 left.  “In overtime, I thought our defense looked like it should,” Thomas said.  Joubert tied it on the Blazers’ next possession, setting the stage for Hicks’ eventual game winner.  “We always want to play inside-out. If we can get Trevor touches, and get his confidence up, it will make the shots our other guys take from the outside a lot easier,” Thomas said.  Tyler Spurlock led Peninsula in scoring with 15, while Jackson joined him and Bockhorn in double figures with 10.  Timberline can make it through the first leg of the 3A SSC season undefeated if it can win against rival North Thurston (5-7) on Wednesday, but Thomas is wary.  “In this league, anybody can beat anybody,” he said.

As part of an ESPN contest, four fans representing the semi-final teams took up residence on a 45-foot (13.72 m) high billboard late on Dec. 26 near the site of the championship game for as long as their respective team remained in the playoffs.  The quartet, who were each provided with a tent and sleeping bag, has been since been reduced to Clemson Tigers fan Nancy Volland of Mount Dora, Florida and Alabama Crimson Tide supporter Llyas Ross Sr from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Volland, a 59-year-old married mother of two daughters, said her time on the 40-foot wide by 8-foot deep platform had flown by but admitted it came with its share of challenges. \"It's not like camping in the woods,\" Volland told Reuters in a telephone interview from the platform. \"You have to go down 72 stairs to go to the bathroom. I've had to go a couple times in the middle of the night so getting out of a nice warm sleeping bag when it's in the 30s (Fahrenheit) and going down those 72 stairs and back up is the hardest part.\"  Volland, who attended Clemson in 1977, is such a diehard fan that she told her now-husband that her only requirement before agreeing to marry him and move to Florida from Charleston was that she got to attend three Tigers home games a year. GIANT LOGOS Ross and Volland were among four people selected from a pool of nearly 700 fans who submitted video testimonials explaining why they should be selected to spend 12 days living in the air. While on the billboard, adorned with a TV and giant logos of their respective teams, the fans pass the time by participating in challenges in which they can win cash and prizes. For Ross, a 39-year-old U.S. Army veteran who served three terms in Iraq, living on a platform for the better part of two weeks is just the latest example of his devotion to Alabama. While deployed, he once woke up in the middle of the night to don Alabama gear and cheer on his team back home even though he had to depart on a mission hours later. Ross, who rang in the new year counting down the seconds until 2019 on a video call with his wife and four children, said living on the billboard had not been that challenging but he was glad his stint was nearing an end. \"I am so ready to get off this billboard,\" Ross told Reuters. \"Not only to see my family but before I see my family to see the national championship game because this will be the very first one I am having the opportunity to attend.\" For top-ranked reigning champion Alabama and No. 2 Clemson, Monday's game will mark the third time in four years that they have met in college football's championship with the two having split their previous showdowns.

More than 500 migrants, most Iranian, tried to cross the narrow stretch of water, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, during 2018, French Interior Ministry data showed.  Some 276 migrants reached British waters while the French authorities thwarted the attempts of another 228. More than 80 percent of the crossings were attempted in December. \"This action plan must enable us to put an end to these crossings of the Channel which are not only illegal but also dangerous,\" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said in a statement. \"It is in our interests, as well as British interests, to do everything possible to prevent the development of new trafficking routes that might attract illegal migrants to our coast once again.\" In late October 2016, France razed a sprawling migrant camp outside the northern port of Calais that served as a launch pad for migrants seeking to enter Britain hidden in trucks, trains and ferries.  The numbers trying to reach Britain increased sharply last year compared with 2017 but remained a tiny fraction of those regularly attempting to reach European Union territory by crossing the Mediterranean from northern Africa and Turkey. Nonetheless, the Channel crossings have put pressure on the British government amid a charged political atmosphere less than three months before Britain is due to leave the EU after a referendum in which immigration was a major theme. British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said HMS Mersey, a Royal Navy offshore patrol vessel, was deploying to the Dover-Calais straits to stem the flow of migrants. The waterway is just 21 miles (33.8 km) wide at its narrowest point.

This is the book business at its darkest and most human, but many balance sheets have been balanced by a posthumous work or two. Death is the moment when all eyes are upon the poet for the last time; beyond, for most harmless drudges, lies the abyss. Leonard Cohen, who died two years ago, wore many a fedora — poet, novelist, songwriter, a singer of sorts — but only the last trade, which he took up reluctantly, made him a star. \r\n\tCohen was never taken very seriously as a poet. He wasn’t much of a singer, either; but the gravelly renderings of his lyrics gradually attracted a mass audience that seemed more like a cult. Many found him a bit much, his heart-on-his-sleeve misery no more appealing than plunging your hands into boiling tar. Still, songs like “Suzanne”, “Bird on the Wire” and the rather preposterous hymn of praise “Hallelujah” have been so widely covered as to be nearly inescapable. At any moment of the day, “Suzanne” is probably playing in an elevator somewhere. \r\n\t \r\n\t  Book cover of The Flame  The Flame has a little of everything for Cohen fans and nothing for anyone else. The publicity matter claims the stray work has been “carefully selected”; but if this is the best of his barrel scrapings, there’s not much barrel to scrape. With a plan laid down by the singer himself, the editors have included his own choice of some 60 poems, the lyrics from his last four albums and a long dreary selection of notebook jottings. The pages have been decorated with 70 or so rumpled self-portraits, with a dozen amateurish doodles of young women thrown in. That perhaps represents the internal proportions of Cohen’s famous vanity and his equally famous lechery — I mean, of course, his search for a muse variously named Marianne, Sahara, Vanessa, Charmaine, Anjani, Mara, Sheila, Heather, Carolina and Olivia.  The poems are monotonous scribbles of the moody-undergraduate school, what young Werther would have sung had he been Canadian:  “O apple of the world  we weren’t married on the surface  we were married at the core  I can’t take it anymore.”  The long miseries and brief graces of love are Cohen’s obsessive subject. Some famous love poems by Bernart de Ventadorn and Dante sound almost as bad when translated, but Cohen doesn’t have that excuse. The poems might seem that much better in Provençal or Tuscan.  The lyrics follow in cornucopian abundance, as if Cohen were possessed by a Dionysian mania forever unassuaged. Genial, sloppy, full of conventional lines, they sometimes have little twists that save them from disaster. Heavy on parallels and antitheses, they’re even heavier on abstractions, the words just a syllable or two, on rare occasions three, almost never four:  “The parking lot is empty  They killed the neon sign  It’s dark from here to St. Jovite  It’s dark all down the line.”  Cohen was not a poet who accidentally became a lyricist; he was a lyricist who for years fooled himself into thinking he was a poet. As poems these squibs are worthless; as lyrics, even sung in that lizardy groan, they often moved millions. His voice, that broken, battered thing, could make almost any song — even “God Save the Queen,” perhaps — sound lonesome, miserable, profound.  The final section consists of disordered entries from the hundreds of notebooks Cohen picked up and pitched down over the years (one was discovered in his refrigerator freezer). Fans who have pined for wisdom like “I think, therefore I am / right up there with / Mary had a Little Lamb” or “I was thinking / of a room in Westminster / room / with a woman from Hell / who thought she was hot” may at last be gratified. In the notebooks, the singer writes, “Whatever happened to my place / in the Anthology of English Literature?” The better question is, Why should he be there in the first place?  It’s hard to understand the cult of Leonard Cohen, the thousands who flocked to concert after concert, leaving with a feeling of illumination or exaltation, the sort of things for which people usually receive get-well cards. There are artists we don’t understand whom we are happy for others to love, and artists who attract an adoration that seems such a colossal mistake we can only shake our heads in bewilderment. Those who love Cohen may find in this gallimaufry the answer to their prayers. For everyone else, the only proper reaction is to shutter the windows and wait for the fever to pass.   © 2019 The New York Times", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Leonard Cohen's posthumous collection of poems, lyrics and sketches", "tags": "Leonard Cohen, songwriter, singer, poet novelist, cohen songs, leonard cohen sketches, Suzanne, Hallelujah", "categories": "Beyond Business", "author": "William Logan; NYT", "sitename": "Business Standard", "image_url": "https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2016-11/11/full/1478873001-4959.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.976311981678009, "responded_url": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/leonard-cohen-s-posthumous-collection-of-poems-lyrics-and-sketches-119010401148_1.html", "publisher": "business-standard.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104161229-00080.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T16:33:25+00:00"}
{"requested_url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/4818114/fact-check-mexico-paying-border-wall-trump/", "plain_text": "FACT CHECK: Mexico is not paying for the border wall, despite what Trump says  President Donald Trump has flatly contradicted his officials on how illicit drugs get into the U.S. and made a fanciful case that Mexico, without putting up a peso, is somehow paying for his proposed border wall. TRUMP: “Remember drugs. The drugs are pouring into this country. They don’t go through the ports of entry. When they do, they sometimes get caught.” – Rose Garden news conference on Friday. THE FACTS: He’s wrong in saying drug smugglers don’t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking. Land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country, not stretches of the border without barriers, says the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Coverage of the proposed wall along America’s southern border on Globalnews.ca:  The agency said in a November report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor-trailers as they drive into the U.S. though entry ports, where they are stopped and subject to inspection. They also employ buses, cargo trains and tunnels, the report says, citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall. — TRUMP: “The new trade deal we have with Mexico and Canada – what we save on that, just with Mexico, will pay for the wall many times over, just in a period of a year, two years or three years. So I view that as absolutely Mexico is paying for the wall.” – Rose Garden news conference. THE FACTS: Mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost.  Trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement, but they can’t be quantified or counted on. For example, he said the deal will dissuade some U.S. companies from moving operations to Mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by Mexico for his wall. The deal updates the North American Free Trade Agreement, in the main preserving NAFTA’s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, while making certain improvements for each country. Trump stated inaccurately that it’s “brand new. It’s totally different.” Moreover, it’s not in effect. The deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured. Trump has argued repeatedly that Mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on $5.6 billion from the U.S. treasury to go toward wall construction. His demand and the refusal of Democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government.  © 2019 The Canadian Press", "published_date": "2019-01-05", "title": "FACT CHECK: Mexico is not paying for the border wall, despite what Trump says - National | Globalnews.ca", "tags": "Donald Trump", "categories": "", "author": "Calvin Woodward; Michael Balsamo", "sitename": "FACT CHECK: Mexico is not paying for the border wall, despite what Trump says", "image_url": null, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9713506102561951, "responded_url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/4818114/fact-check-mexico-paying-border-wall-trump/", "publisher": "globalnews.ca", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190105073009-00084.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-05T07:57:32+00:00"}

The next two months will be crucial for both sides who must maintain their intensity and continue to pick up points at an alarming rate.  So who has the better run in January? Here we take a look at Manchester City and Liverpool's next five league matches to see how it could shape the title race moving into the business end of this season's campaign.  Manchester City's next match in the English top flight is at home to Wolves , who they'll be expecting to beat at the Etihad.  They then travel to Huddersfield , who can't seem to stem the flow of their losing streak at the moment, meaning the Reds will again be hot favourites to take home three points.  City's third league match after Liverpool is against Newcastle at St James' Park. The Magpies have proven themselves defensively organised at home this season, but again City should be taking all three points from the tie.  The Citizens' final two matches in this run of five are both at home, which is a bonus, but are against Arsenal and Chelsea.      Pep Guardiola's men have already beaten the Gunners once this season at the Emirates, but the match will be anything but a walk in the park.  Chelsea on the other hand got the better of Manchester City at Stamford Bridge not too long ago, and Mauricio Sarri will be looking for a repeat performance from his players.  Liverpool meanwhile head to Brighton for their first league game after City, where they will be expecting to bounce back with a win.  After that they play host to Crystal Palace and Leicester City - again teams that can pose problems on their day, but again teams Klopp will be expecting his Reds side to beat.  Liverpool's final two matches in this run of five are against West Ham at the London Stadium and Bournemouth at Anfield.  West Ham have been on a great run of form, but their recent defeat to Burnley proves they still have errors in them, and will therefore have to be at their absolute best to get anything against Liverpool.  Bournemouth meanwhile have been suffering of late, recording three defeats and a draw in their past five matches.  At Anfield, you'd think, Liverpool will have too much for them and you'd have to say have the easier run out of the two title challengers in their next five games.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "What Liverpool and Man City's next 5 matches tell us about title race", "tags": "Premier League,Manchester City FC,Liverpool FC,Emirates,Barclays Premier League;Premier League;Manchester City FC;Liverpool FC;Emirates;Barclays Premier League", "categories": "Soccer News", "author": "Irishmirror ie", "sitename": "Irishmirror", "image_url": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13785822.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Premier-League-Liverpool-vs-Manchester-City.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9751344919204712, "responded_url": "https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/what-liverpool-man-citys-next-13813352", "publisher": "irishmirror.ie", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104161229-00080.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T16:42:35+00:00"}

{"requested_url": "https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/little-known-law-thats-confusing-15628588", "plain_text": "An obscure law affecting those who marry after having children is leaving parents confused.  The legislation, which is not commonly known says, parents in Britain should re-register the birth of their child or children after marrying.  This is regardless of whether the natural father or mother is already on the child's birth certificate.  Kent Live reports , it seems, many parents are unaware this law even exists, while others reportedly know about it but have been told it is unneccessary.  A link to the government's LA1 form for people to re-register has been shared among Facebook groups this week, with some parents questioning whether they need to take any action.  The newspaper spoke to a solicitor for an explanation and to ask whether the legislation is upheld, or forgotten.  Possible small fine  The solicitor, Katharine Marshall, described how the legislation relates to a time when illegitimate children could not inherit from their parents, but the legal framework is now outdated, and it's hugely unlikely parents would fall foul of it and incur any punishment.  Marshall said: “When people who already have children together get married, under the Legitimacy Act 1976 parents must re-register the birth of their children, regardless of whether the natural father was included on the child’s birth certificate at the time of original registration. You need to do this through a form LA1.  “The re-registration is not to grant the father parental responsibility - he’d already have this as an unmarried father, provided he was included on the original birth certificate - but for the child to be recognised as a ‘child of the marriage.  “The Legitimacy Act 1976 stems from days when the legitimacy of a child would impact inheritance, but this no longer applies, provided there’s proof they’re a child of the parent - yet the Legitimacy Act 1976 remains.”  It is possible for parents to face a small fine for not filling in the form, but Katharine says she’s never heard of this happening.  She said: “Failure to re-register may incur a nominal £2 fine, but I’m yet to come across any parent who has been charged. I’m sure there’s a huge number of families who have no idea this requirement even exists.”", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Unknown law is confusing parents who got married after having children", "tags": "UK & World News", "categories": "UK & World News", "author": "Emma Gill; Abigail Rabbett; Victoria Chessum", "sitename": "Cambridgenews", "image_url": "https://i2-prod.cambridge-news.co.uk/incoming/article15628564.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_family-stock.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9695714116096497, "responded_url": "https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/little-known-law-thats-confusing-15628588", "publisher": "cambridge-news.co.uk", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104104759-00078.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T11:10:30+00:00"}

But first... Despite exploring \"all possible options,\" the Germantown Country Club will fold this February for financial reasons, ending a nearly 50-year run. Thanks, millennials. That's right. Traditional country clubs are in trouble across the country as their aging memberships dwindle and debt-laden, golf-shy millennials look for less posh options. And, really, who can blame them? The Germantown Country Club's regular monthly membership costs $337, plus a quarterly food and beverage minimum of $180. For millennials, that money could buy a lot of avocados and craft beer. Meanwhile, millennials have more casual golfing options like TopGolf and, in the same vein, Let it Fly, a driving range and sports bar concept Tigers assistant coach Mike Miller is bringing to Germantown. From a financial standpoint, selling the lush country club properties for redevelopment makes more sense than trying to woo these uninterested millennials. The old north golf course of the Colonial Country Club in Cordova could get a $300 million mixed-use makeover. The Racquet Club of Memphis closes later this year, and could be on tap for a new Hilton hotel and upscale apartments. Reporter Corinne Kennedy and Executive Editor Mark Russell, who teamed up on the Germantown club closure story, hinted at those same points in their article: As Germantown has grown, the amount of available land to build on has decreased. The golf course property could be valuable to developers looking to build in the suburb. Golf’s popularity has declined in recent years as fewer young people take up the game. A 2016 report on the golf economy in the U.S. by research firm TEConomy Partners, LLC showed a net decline of more than 700 golf facilities since 2011. However, the average revenue generated by golf facilities nationwide grew by almost 3 percent in the same timespan. So, the takeaway from the closure of the Germantown Country Club: the country club era is coming to a close — and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Maybe fresh new concepts will fill the void, offering a more diverse, less costly alternative to the old clubs. Memphis Tigers zap Shockers in 85-74 win The University of Memphis men's basketball team last night won the first of their 13 games in the American Athletic Conference (AAC), taking down Wichita State 85-74. Our Drew Hill opened his story with an anecdote that kind of sums up the game: Memphis freshman Antwann Jones intercepted a Wichita State pass at the top of the key late in the first half Thursday night and raced down the floor. \"Showtime!\" Memphis assistant coach Mike Miller yelled before the freshman slammed home a one-handed dunk. Memphis defeated Wichita State Thursday in the AAC opener for both teams. Jason Munz, Southern Miss Sports Writer \"Showtime!\" For Tigers coach Penny Hardaway, that's what last night was all about, Mark Giannotto wrote in a pre-game column. Hardaway is out to prove what he's often said: that predictions of an eighth-place finish in the AAC were disrespectful and wrong-headed. And, according to Mark, Hardaway is still hoping for an NCAA tournament slot. Speaking of sports: Wednesday's locker room altercation between Memphis Grizzlies players Garrett Temple and Omri Casspi comes as the team struggles with mounting losses and a leadership void, according to this insightful analysis by our David Cobb. Temple yesterday said they were \"brothers getting into it,\" Cobb also reports. Will Shelby County fight immigration law? The Shelby County attorney concluded a new state law is so vague it could force indefinite detention of some immigrants. Jail photos by Brad Vest. Daniel Connolly, The Commercial Appeal Shelby County appears poised to resist a new state law requiring the county to detain jailed immigrants for federal agents, based on this story from our Daniel Connolly. The new law says local governments must comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to hold suspected unauthorized immigrants until agents can come pick them up, Daniel reports. The problem, according to County Attorney Marlinee Iverson, is that holding people indefinitely would violate the U.S. constitution: \"So it could be 48 hours, it could be 48 weeks, it could be 48 years,\" Iverson told reporters Thursday. \"And that's an unreasonable result.\" She said the law is \"void for vagueness.\" She makes a good point. Perhaps ICE wouldn't leave people in indefinite detention. But if they do request an indefinite detention, it would be inhumane and cruel for the county to comply. Also, from a purely financial perspective, indefinite detentions would be deeply unfair to the county, which is paying the bills while ICE keeps suspects on ice.

For retired Rep. Bob Brady, D-Penn., leaving Congress will finally give him the chance to smoke marijuana.  When asked by the Philadelphia Inquirer in December what he planned to do after ending his 20-year career in Congress, Brady said that he had never smoked marijuana in his life, and that he wondered if it was legal yet in Pennsylvania. \"I'm gonna do it,\" Brady said. \"And I ain't gonna wait for the law. I could care less.\" The Inquirer followed up with Brady this week, asking if he still harbored the dream of engaging in a little reefer madness. Brady said that he would but now says he'll wait until it is legal in the state. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has said that the state needs to \"take a serious look\" at the issue, but the Republican-controlled General Assembly is unlikely to approve legalization any time soon. According to the Inquirer, Brady told the students in the Organizational Dynamics class he taught at the University of Pennsylvania that he had never smoked marijuana but planned to try it. A student offered him three joints after class, which he declined.

{"requested_url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/225629/dr-theodore-papaloizos-remarkable-story/", "plain_text": "In 1949, when 26-year-old Theodore Papaloizos became the choir director, chanter, and principal of the Greek School at St. Sophia Cathedral in Washington, DC, Harry Truman was president, TV soap operas were introduced, and the typical annual salary for an American worker was about $3,000.  In 1959, Papaloizos, who turns 96 on February 8, left St. Sophia for the other Greek Orthodox parish in the nation’s capital, Sts. Constantine and Helen. He has led the choir there continuously since then. Earlier in his career at that church, he served as the principal of the Greek department of the parochial school. He also found time to direct the afternoon Greek classes.  “I never thought I would still be leading the choir,” said Papaloizos, who was born in Cairo and raised in Cyprus, his father’s homeland. His mother hailed from the island of Samos.  In 1946, along with his first wife, Angela, Papaloizos emigrated to the United States, settling in Pittsburgh. The couple raised four children. When she was 40, Angela died of a brain tumor. Maria, his second wife, and mother of their two children, also sings in the choir.  “I’ve still got my voice!” he asserted over coffee after the Divine Liturgy at the church’s sprawling new campus in suburban Silver Spring, Md. “Probably God likes my voice,” he added with a gentle laugh, under a thick forest of gray hair.  While Papaloizos is proud of his contributions to the church, there is a second longtime venture that has sparked joy in his heart: writing the flurry of Greek language textbooks for youngsters and adults. He founded a home-based business in 1956, running his first book off on a mimeograph machine. Before long, his brand skyrocketed, making his books the ones churches and individuals trusted when exploring the nuances of Modern Greek.  “I feel humbled, really,” he declared of his nationwide success. “Greek grammar is very difficult. I created a simplified way of learning grammar.” For example, he said he “classified verbs to make it very easy for kids to understand.”  Papaloizos recently put the finishing touches on his latest book. This one, he said, is designed for high-school students who have never attended Greek school. Those in that age group, he maintained, “have minds that are more open because they’ve been exposed to grammar in high school.”  When he’s not writing, Papaloizos, who holds a doctorate in Greek and Latin classics, said he rises at 8 AM and immediately begins thinking about writing. Boosting him into the daily rhythm includes walking 500 steps around the patio in the back yard of his home. In his younger days, he recalled, he would walk up to six miles a day.  As the bright morning sun danced through the upper windows of the sanctuary, Papaloizos, as usual, sprang to his feet. A walker, a chair and a bottle of water stood at the ready. But the river of adrenaline and passion that coursed through his veins would not allow him to sit.  The various hand signals he made were crisp, seamless, and perfectly measured. When the vocalists collaborated to showcase particularly enchanting liturgical notes, the director smiled his approval. That was followed by words of praise delivered in a gentle, honeyed baritone – still in the moment.  When it was time for the sermon – and still very much in the moment – Papaloizos briskly lowered himself in the red chair before taking a quick sip of water. Then, his compact space illuminated by the small reading lamp that holds notes and music, he bowed his head that revealed the exquisite intensity of a monastery monk in prayer.  Sitting in a chair directly in front of the choir was Pauline Mantzouranis. As the worship service wound down, Papaloizos gracefully stepped away to greet friends, Pauline Mantzouranis sat in her chair and waxed nostalgic.  “I could sit here for hours!” and reminisce about Papaloizos, promised Mantzouranis, now in her 80s, who sang in St. Constantine and Helen’s choir for 55 years. “Everything he does he does with love. He taught with love. He taught with love in his writings. When he speaks to you, it’s not a person speaking. It’s spiritual love.”  Stasy Marlas Ward, a current member of the choir, agreed. Years before in parochial school, Papaloizos instructed her in an assortment of subjects from math and science to geography and mythology. His presence left a deep impact. “He is exceptional in every way,” she emphasized. “He’s driven, inspiring, just full of ideas. I’ve learned perseverance from him and how to enjoy life to its fullest. He’s always looking forward.”  The Reverend Father Michael Eaccarino, priest at Sts. Constantine and Helen, said he remains captivate by the high-octane energy Papaloizos exhibits while leading the choir. “When we see this man at his age…he is running circles around the younger whippersnappers,” asserted the 69-year-old Eaccarino, who arrived at the church five years ago following an assignment in Tarpon Springs, FL. “And that includes me!”  Eaccarino remembered when His Eminence Archbishop Demetrios was visiting the church, he heard the soulfulness of the choir and was enchanted. “He was absolutely taken by the beautiful sound.”  While Eaccarino expects Papaloizos to be in his customary role indefinitely, he did acknowledge the choir members are getting older. “Younger people are not engaging in the ministry of sacred music.”  The importance of maintaining the rich musical tradition is something that Papaloizos is trying to preserve, the priest stressed. To generate awareness and interest, Papaloizos is trying to organize a youth choir at the church, where 350 families make up the membership rolls.  As an educator, Papaloizos didn’t tolerate misbehavior, said Betsy Cizek, a retired school teacher.  “Greek School went from four to six,” two days a week, she said. Students huddled in a rundown chapel nestled behind the priest’s house that featured dusty classrooms and an unreliable heating system. “Mr. Papaloizos would put the fear of God in all of us. He was a no-nonsense kind of guy. He didn’t tolerate funny business.”  And yet, as a retired public school teacher in Maryland, Cizek, 67, appreciated the discipline that she was exposed to. “I recently came across my first-grade Greek book. I’m confident if it wasn’t for Mr. Papaloizos I wouldn’t be able to speak or write Greek on a passable level.”  As he emptied his coffee cup, the connected and curious nonagenarian put a fine point on his recipe for happiness across the lifespan.  “Love what you’re doing,” began the author of thirty books, his voice lively, strong and resolute. “Don’t expect to conquer the world. Be satisfied with the simple things you have. And be kind to people.”", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Dr. Theodore Papaloizos’ Remarkable Story", "tags": "", "categories": "Related News;Associations;Church;General News;Arts & Literature;History & Science;Events;Politics;Economy;Community;Greece;Cyprus;International;USA;General news;Columnists;Editorial;Guest Columnists;Letter from Athens;Letter to the Editor;Agora", "author": "Tony Glaros", "sitename": "Dr. Theodore Papaloizos' Remarkable Story", "image_url": null, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9798116087913513, "responded_url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/225629/dr-theodore-papaloizos-remarkable-story/", "publisher": "thenationalherald.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104185010-00081.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T19:30:04+00:00"}

One of the sources, a senior administration official, said the White House has kept this option on the table for some time, but is now considering it more seriously. \"Depending on the severity of crisis, it’s always been an option. Now that things are getting worse, we are looking at how that could be operationalized and used to confront the crisis,\" the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The official said the talks are ongoing and will continue over the weekend as details are worked out. ABC News first reported that the White House was considering declaring a national emergency to build the wall. Trump said at a press briefing Friday he was considering declaring a national emergency in order to bypass Congress. \"We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country,\" Trump said at the press briefing in the Rose Garden. However, the numbers of border crossers are not at all-time highs. Fiscal year 2018, which ended Sept. 30, saw a lower numbers of illegal border crossings than fiscal year 2014 or fiscal year 2016. Asked if the Department of Defense was open to the idea of using its resources to build the wall, the official simply said the president would use his power as the commander in chief. The official did not rule out that the Federal Emergency Management Administration, a part of DHS, may also be used as part of a national emergency response.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Lawyers discussing details of using national emergency to build wall", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Julia Ainsley Julia Ainsley is a national security reporter", "sitename": "NBC News", "image_url": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_01/2704751/190104-donald-trump-announcement-border-wall-ew-413p_c1f698e1cd2934fb6abe132854e23fb2.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9695449471473694, "responded_url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-admin-lawyers-eye-national-emergency-pentagon-resources-build-wall-n954926", "publisher": "nbcnews.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104220826-00082.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T22:42:54+00:00"}

Beasley rejoining the team comes at a needed time as injuries have depleted the Lakers’ depth.  LeBron James, who was already ruled out for the game with the New York Knicks, won’t travel with the Lakers on their two-game road trip and is due to be re-evaluated in one week. The timeline guarantees he will miss at least the next four games.  Meanwhile, Kyle Kuzma was on hand at the practice facility but received treatment on his lower back contusion in lieu of participating in shootaround. Kuzma remains questionable to play against the Knicks.  “The back is tough,” Lakers head coach Luke Walton said. “You can’t really play through back pain. You get locked up and you can’t move. He’s been getting treatment, and we’ll see how he’s feeling and moving around tonight.”  In the event Kuzma is unavailable, joining James and Rajon Rondo, it could mean an opportunity for Beasley. He last played Dec. 7, scoring 4 points in 8 minutes of a loss to the San Antonio Spurs.  “It was a nice energy boost seeing Michael in the gym,” Walton said. “His teammates love him and it’s just good to have him back. If Kuz does not play, then Beasley will be an option. He told me he’s been running. I told him we could find that out real quick if I decide to play him.  “But he had great energy in here today.”  Reminder: Vivid Seats is the Official Ticket Reseller of LakersNation.com.

{"requested_url": "https://www.westernjournal.com/court-allows-transgender-military-ban-stand/", "plain_text": "A Federal appeals court upheld President Donald Trump’s military transgender ban on Friday, lifting an injunction that prevented the government from limiting transgender military service.  “The District Court made an erroneous finding that the (administration’s policy) was the equivalent of a blanket ban on transgender service,” the appeals court wrote, according to The Washington Post.  Advertisement - story continues below  “The government took substantial steps to cure the procedural deficiencies the court identified in the enjoined 2017 presidential memorandum,” the panel said, according to USA Today.  The Trump administration had decided to allow those with gender dysmorphia to serve, but only if they served under the gender assigned to them at birth and not the one that they self identify with.  The ruling said the partial ban “plausibly relies upon the ‘considered professional judgment’ of ‘appropriate military officials,’ and appears to permit some transgender individuals to serve in the military.”  The decision was made by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and made up of judges appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.  Advertisement - story continues below  Do you think the court was right to rule in favor of Trump?    American Military News reported that while the ruling is in favor of the Trump administration’s ban, there will not be an immediate impact on troops because there are three cases in other courts where the ban is being challenged.  President Donald Trump announced the proposed policy on Twitter in July 2017.  “After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,” Trump tweeted.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017  The president went on to say that, “Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.”  A memorandum released in March 2018 expanded on the proposed policy and read, “Among other things, the policies set forth by the Secretary of Defense state that transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria — individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery — are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances.”  Advertisement - story continues below  The president’s announcement brought turmoil among LGBTQ activists, and the decision has been challenged multiple times since the initial announcement was made.  Shannon Minter, legal director at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, called the recent ruling “devastating.”  “Today’s ruling is a devastating slap in the face to transgender service members who have proved their fitness to serve and their dedication to this country,” Minter said, according to USA Today.  According to USA Today, there have been dozens of transgender recruits who have signed up since Jan 1, 2018, when they became eligible and there are several thousand active-duty transgender troops.

Thank goodness we have The SpaceX founder posted a bizarre/cryptic/silly tweet on Thursday saying, \"There are no coincidences,\" along with a meme of Neil Armstrong in a spacesuit next to an image of an alien. The meme says, \"Neil Armstrong was the first person to land on the moon. 'Neil A.' backwards is 'alien.'\" The tweet attracted a storm of over 475,000 likes. Musk soon followed it up with another backwards musing: \"Evian, the first bottled water, is naive spelled backwards.\" A tabloid story in early 2018 claimed NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin saw aliens during the Apollo 11 moon mission in 1969, but it was quickly debunked. Comments on Musk's tweet point out that there were indeed aliens on the moon: the humans who set foot on it.  The backwards Neil Armstrong idea isn't new.

{"requested_url": "https://www.oregonlive.com/beavers/2019/01/oregon-state-women-surge-late-to-beat-washington-state-in-pac-12-opener.html", "plain_text": "CORVALLIS — Oregon State’s string of 10 consecutive victories over Washington State suggests a period of steady dominance in the series. But many of the women’s basketball matchups have been competitive, a trend that continued Friday night at Gill Coliseum. Plucky Washington State couldn’t hold a four-point fourth-quarter lead as the 11th-ranked Beavers surged late for a 76-69 win in their Pac-12 opener. “What a great battle that was and that’s kind of what you expect in this conference,” Oregon State coach Scott Rueck said. “You have to give Washington State a lot of credit. That’s a veteran team, a lot of scoring potential and ability on that team. … They made the plays and got the momentum, and fourth quarter we had to step up. And this team did.” Trailing 65-61 with under three minutes to play, the Beavers (11-2, 1-0) used a 13-1 run to seal their latest demanding win in the rivalry. Oregon State needed overtime to survive on the road last year and scraped out three straight single-digit victories in 2014-15 and 2015-16. The Cougars (6-7, 1-1), who began Pac-12 play with a 79-76 win at Washington, have another difficult assignment Sunday at No. 5 Oregon. “They are the kind of programs we aspire to be,” first-year Washington State coach Kamie Ethridge said. “I just respect the heck out of Scott and the kind of kids he recruits … and obviously this environment and what he’s built here is amazing. It’s a great opportunity for us to walk into these environments and compete against some top 10 programs.” Mikayla Pivec had 14 points and seven rebounds for Oregon State, which lost key reserve Kat Tudor to a left knee injury midway through the second quarter. Rueck did not have an update on Tudor’s health after the game. On the fateful play, Tudor jumped for a rebound near Washington State’s basket, came down awkwardly and immediately reached for her knee. The junior guard was able to walk off the court with assistance and went straight to the locker room before a concerned Gill Coliseum crowd of 4,733. Tudor, who is averaging 12.3 points per game this season, watched most of the second half from Oregon State’s bench. She is not expected to be available for Sunday’s 2 p.m. game against Washington. “Of course when you see a teammate go down, you care,” Oregon State forward Maddie Washington said. “But at the same time you have to focus back on the game. You still have a mission that you have to accomplish. So of course, yes, we had Kat in the back of our mind, but you have to play through it.” The Beavers did after a rough patch that saw their 13-point halftime lead evaporate. Jovana Subasic’s third three-pointer of the game tied it at 57-57 early in the fourth quarter. Borislava Hristova, the reigning Pac-12 player of the week, scored two of her game-high 24 points to make it 60-57 Cougars. Katie McWilliams answered with a three, but Washington State kept the pressure on and led 65-61 on a Chanelle Molina jumper. Oregon State’s 13-1 run began with a Destiny Slocum layup and included a Taya Corosdale step-back three that put OSU up for good at 67-65. McWilliams and Slocum both had crucial buckets down the stretch as Rueck opted for set plays over the Beavers’ typical motion offense. Oregon State made 5 of its last 6 shots from the floor. “Execution is what we focus on,” Corosdale said. “When we execute, we do things right and we usually get up a pretty good shot.” Slocum had 12 points and eight assists for the Beavers, while Aleah Goodman added 10 points off the bench. Washington (seven points, 10 rebounds) and Corosdale (eight points, nine rebounds) earned high praise from Rueck. The Cougars missed their final seven field goal attempts and had just three points in the final 3:21. “I think once we finally put our foot down and said that we’d had enough of them scoring on us, it was great to see what our defense could do,” Washington said. Washington State kept pace early, going up 14-13 on a Hristova basket. Pivec answered with a three-pointer on the other end to give the Beavers a two-point advantage after one quarter. Slocum, Corosdale and Tudor then hit consecutive threes as the lead swelled to 25-16. Tudor knocked down another to make it 28-18 with 6:35 remaining in the half before going down about a minute later. Oregon State led by as many as 15 in the second quarter and headed to the locker room up 44-31. The Beavers were without reserve forward Janessa Thropay, who suffered a broken left finger during last week’s win over Cal State Bakersfield. Thropay, a junior, underwent surgery and is out indefinitely. -- Bob Lundeberg for The Oregonian/OregonLive", "published_date": "2019-01-05", "title": "Oregon State women surge late to beat Washington State in Pac-12 opener", "tags": "", "categories": "Sports", "author": "Bob Lundeberg; OregonLive", "sitename": "oregonlive.com", "image_url": "https://i.oregonlive.com/resizer/19Uy7r98zO4Ncgr9E8hVOVIkgNA=/620x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal/public/4YM5ATXHORAPLHXBMUAYT5C7KE.JPG", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9715844988822937, "responded_url": "https://www.oregonlive.com/beavers/2019/01/oregon-state-women-surge-late-to-beat-washington-state-in-pac-12-opener.html", "publisher": "oregonlive.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190105073009-00084.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-05T08:38:45+00:00"}

Under Sinochem chairman Frank Ning, who took his post in early 2016, the state group has experimented with new ways of expansion and asset management, such as creating digital platforms for energy trading and logistics services, to add value to its traditional oil and chemicals operations. \"Sinochem created the tech firm in the hope of aiding the IPO of the traditional energy business,\" said a company official. \"But as it was exploring an unknown territory, the company expanded too fast too early without a very coherent strategy,\" said the official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the press. Investors were not impressed by the way the Sinochem unit grew and spent with little prospect for immediate revenue boost, said a second Beijing-based source who was briefed by the group's management about the scale-back. Most of the job cuts were related to operations, marketing and customer services, while the core divisions such as data analysis and product development have been retained, said the company official. Sinochem announced its foray into internet-based energy services in August 2017, and at the beginning of 2018 launched the new company in a tech park in Beijing, with a registered capital of 1 billion yuan ($145 million). \"The digital platforms cover the supply chain from oil trading, refinery optimization, oil and chemicals marketing, gas station chain management ... in a push for digital revolution in petroleum and chemical industry,\" Sinochem said on its website.

The pop icon was scheduled to debut a new Las Vegas residency show called “Domination” in February, but postponed her return to the stage after her father, Jamie Spears, was hospitalized. “I am dedicating my focus and energy to care for my family,” Spears said in a statement, according to Variety. “We have a very special relationship and I want to be with my family at this time just like they have always been there for me.” “Thank you to all my fans for your continued love and support during this time,” she continued. “I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and I look forward to the time when I can be back on stage performing for all of you.” Two months ago, the singer’s father underwent surgery for a ruptured colon at a local hospital in Las Vegas, where he stayed for 28 days under medical care. He’s now recuperating at home and expected to make a full recovery. In an Instagram post, Spears expanded on her decision to delay the “Domination” show until a later date. She said it “breaks [her] heart” to let fans down. “I don’t even know where to start with this, because this is so tough for me to say. I will not be performing my new show Domination,” she wrote alongside a photo of her family when she was a child. “I’ve been looking forward to this show and seeing all of you this year, so doing this breaks my heart,” Spears wrote. “However, it’s important to always put your family first… and that’s the decision I had to make.” Spears said her father “nearly died” from the medical emergency and that she’ll be dedicating her energy going forward to helping him on his road to recovery. “I had to make the difficult decision to put my full focus and energy on my family at this time,” she added. “I hope you all can understand.” Refunds for the show will be made available while the concerts are put on hold until further notice In October, Spears announced her return to Las Vegas nine months after bidding farewell to the city with a splashy parade through the Strip. The residency was set to kick off in February and run through August at the Park Theater at Park MGM, which has hosted performers such as Lady Gaga, Cher, Bruno Mars and more throughout the years. Spears was expected to rake in a reported $507,000 per show, unseating Celine Dion as the highest paid entertainer in Las Vegas. Her hugely successful first residency “Britney: Piece of Me” grossed more than $137 million over four years and was seen by more than 700,000 people. That show initially launched in 2013 for a planned two-year run, but continued until December 2017 with Spears performing nearly 250 shows at Planet Hollywood.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Britney Spears Is Taking An 'Indefinite Work Hiatus' After Father's Hospitalization", "tags": "Celebrities,britney spears;Celebrities,britney spears", "categories": "Entertainment", "author": "Cole Delbyck", "sitename": "HuffPost", "image_url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c2f98053c000014060f3ac4.jpeg?cache=wpgzdmzuop&ops=1910_1000", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9838789701461792, "responded_url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/britney-spears-hiatus-father_us_5c2f964be4b0bdd0de58794b", "publisher": "huffingtonpost.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104185010-00081.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T20:10:10+00:00"}

Steiner wrote the theme music for The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show and Perry Mason. While Alexander Courage composed the theme music for the original Star Trek TV series (TOS), Steiner's significant contributions to the franchise included composing more of the incidental music for TOS than any other composer, as well as scoring or conducting the music for 29 of the show's 79 episodes. Steiner also composed and orchestrated additional music for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), was part of the team of composers for the 1985 film, The Color Purple, which received an Oscar nomination, and was an uncredited composer for Return of the Jedi. Steiner was most active in television series during the 1950s and 1960s. His numerous composition credits included music for Hogan's Heroes, Have Gun–Will Travel, The Twilight Zone, Gunsmoke, and Rawhide.

{"requested_url": "https://www.techradar.com/au/news/software/operating-systems/android-in-2020-the-future-of-google-s-mobile-os-explored-1168141", "plain_text": "Cast your mind back to late 2008, when the first Android-powered handset saw the light of day. Obama won his first Presidential election, Apple launched its App Store (the iPhone had appeared the year before), Google announced its own Chrome browser and we got our first look at the company's new mobile OS on the T-Mobile G1. The Android of 2016 is a world away from that 2008 version, where the Android Market was in its infancy, there were no native video playback capabilities embedded and the G1 had no multi-touch support. In short, it was a phone that sat very happily on the pile of 'might make it big one day if the stars align' moonshots that companies were throwing out at that time. But Google did make a success of Android, seeing it grow to the most dominant operating system in the smartphone world - but it will need to keep innovating and improving its mobile OS to keep that lion's share. We've re-tooled this article to take a peek into the future with our new knowledge, helping us see what Android might look like in the year 2020. With new Android monikers now appearing about once a year (Android N expected around October), its codename should start with an \"R\" - Rhubarb Pie, Rocky Road or Rice Pudding, perhaps? Or maybe even Rolos, giving Google another chocolate brand tie-up? Here are the four key features we think could play the biggest part in Android's ongoing evolution over the next seven years: Maps in Android in 2020 Apple's Maps app may not have set the world alight when it launched, but it's now growing in use (to the point where the brand is claiming it's the dominant mapping platform on iPhones) and that means Google needs to keep enriching its mapping app to stay ahead. Recent Google Maps refreshes have brought with them a greater level of customisation based on your personal searches, and this will only increase in the future. With Google Now tracking your every move, you might already be seeing directions to your favourite watering hole appear on-screen every Friday lunchtime or to the football field every Monday evening, all handled automatically. Richard Jones, Principal Lecturer in Computing at Buckinghamshire New University thinks this knowledge of your habits could be key to the future of how we interact with our phones and may alter how much we depend on our phones. He believes that what will drive innovation is what he calls \"Ambient Intelligence\". He told us that \"In essence this will see people functioning naturally in digitally enabled/enhanced environments using presence-responsive devices that are tailored to their personalised requirements and anticipatory of their behaviour.\" So, for example, in 2020, if the bar in question has an Android-friendly program installed, you might even find your tipple of choice waiting for you when you arrive, because Android will have been able to figure out where you're going, what you're doing, and what you want to drink. The question of whether this will actually happen isn't as clear - many people won't like to have their movements predicted to such a degree, so it will likely be strictly opt-in and have to involve some kind of credit - after all, no bar is going to pour drinks on the off-chance you appear, no matter how likely that is. As for all of the services hanging off Maps, Google is already hiring out the Street View cameras and enabling you to peek inside buildings - you can expect Android 2020 to offer better imagery of most public buildings, as well as tappable info as you move around. Google augments its own data with user-generated content to provide an even more up-to-date view of the world, and once initiatives such as Jump (Google's own - expensive - 360-degree VR rig) become more established you'll be able to see most parts of the world in stunning detail and from the comfort of your own home with the rise of Cardboard... or whatever Google is up to next in VR. More broadly, with the rise of the Internet of Things, we can expect mapping data to get even better. As more gadgets come online that can provide real-time updates on traffic, weather and more, directions are going to get even better and more accurate, saving us more time when travelling. Perhaps one of the most interesting potential mapping innovations could come out Google's Project Tango. This is a real-time 3D mapping technology that uses phones with two cameras on recreate your view in 3D - a bit like Microsoft's Kinect. This technology could be used not just to create cool-looking 3D maps (imagine a 3D Streetview you could zoom around like Grand Theft Auto), but could have practical applications too such as helping the blind and partially sighted navigate more easily - all using the power of your phone. Multiple brands are launching Tango-enabled phones this year, so by 2020 this should have become an established part of the Android ecosystem.", "published_date": "2016-02-14", "title": "Android in 2020: how much could Google's OS change?", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "David Nield", "sitename": "TechRadar", "image_url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/95cfad393479792b0c44bf78455389be-1200-80.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9589539170265198, "responded_url": "https://www.techradar.com/au/news/software/operating-systems/android-in-2020-the-future-of-google-s-mobile-os-explored-1168141", "publisher": "techradar.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104185010-00081.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T20:14:36+00:00"}

The Government has passed an order hiking the fee of RTC and 35 other services rendered at Nada Kacheris and Atalji Janasnehi Centres with effect from Jan.1, 2019. Following the hike, the RTC will cost Rs.5 more and Rs.2 more for each additional page. Also the fee of certificates issued in respect of 35 other services has been hiked by Rs.10. Earlier, the RTC was issued for Rs.10 at Nada Kacheris, Taluk Office and Spandana counter in the Deputy Commissioner’s (DC) Office. But as per new order, the RTC now costs Rs.15 and the applicant has to pay Rs.2 per extra page in case the document runs up to more than five pages.  Also, the fee for the services rendered at Atalji Janasnehi Centres has been hiked from Rs. 15 to Rs.25. Students now have to pay Rs.25 for getting income and caste certificate.  The farmers can get RTC and other certificates at the counter in Mini Vidhana Soudha, Nazarbad, Spandana counter in the DC’s office in the city and at Varuna, Yelwal and Jayapura Nada Kacheris in the Taluk.  A total of 35 different certificates are issued at Atalji Janasnehi Centres located in MCC Zonal Offices at Jayanagar, Ramakrishnanagar, Yadavagiri (Akashavani Circle) and Ambedkar Circle (FTS Circle) and at Ambedkar Samudaya Bhavan, Hebbal.  All those centres totally receive thousands of applications every day, with a majority of them seeking RTC certificates. Meanwhile, the KRRS has condemned the hike in RTC and other fees.  KRRS leader Badagalapura Nagendra said that the Government had reduced the fee from Rs. 15 to Rs.10 four years ago, following an agitation by the then KRRS MLA K.S. Puttannaiah. But the Government has hiked the fee again, which is deplorable, he said and added that the KRRS would take up the issue at a meeting to take place at Bengaluru     on Jan.5.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Sudden hike in RTC and other Certificates fee draws flak from farmers - Star of Mysore", "tags": "RTC", "categories": "News", "author": "Name", "sitename": "Star of Mysore", "image_url": "https://starofmysore.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/News-6.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9550522565841675, "responded_url": "https://starofmysore.com/sudden-hike-in-rtc-and-other-certificates-fee-draws-flak-from-farmers/", "publisher": "starofmysore.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104133413-00079.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T14:46:26+00:00"}

Here’s out top ten pick of premium products to look forward to in 2019. BMW 3 Series Sedan BMW will launch the X7 SUV, Z4 sports car and rebirthed 8 Series GT, but an all-new 3 Series sedan is where the sales volume is. This seventh-generation 3 Series is longer, wider and stuffed with new technology. Come September, expect a range of economical petrols and diesels plus a plug-in hybrid. You’ll have to wait until 2020 for the rapid M3 models. Mercedes-Benz EQC Benz will be busy with its new B-Class, A-Class sedan, A35, CLA, GLS and GLE arriving, but its EQC SUV headlines as the brand’s first production electric vehicle. Due by year’s end, it shares a platform with the GLC SUV and should cost from $100,000. The EQC has dual electric motors putting out 300kW and 765Nm, a 0-100km/h time of 5.1-seconds, all-wheel-drive and a claimed range of 450km. Audi Q3 No rest for Audi with the RS5 Sportback, A6, A1 Sportback, e-tron and facelifted TT and R8 due. In mid-2019 the second-generation Q3 SUV will do the heavy sales lifting though. The compact SUV will be bigger, comfier and flush with Audi’s excellent latest tech and connectivity. Styling is sportier and more muscled, with its giant front grille mirroring the brand’s larger SUVs. Four-cylinder turbo petrols and diesels will be offered. Tesla Model 3 Order books opened for Tesla’s “affordable” electric car in March 2016, and it looks like finally the mid-size sedan will arrive by the middle of the year. Expect a rear-drive entry- level Model 3 with 350km range and sub-six seconds 0-100km/h, longer (500km) range examples, and a hot Performance version with 0-100km/h time of about 3.6 seconds. Prices? Keep guessing. Jaguar F-Pace SVR The elegant F-Pace mid-size SUV scores proper performance in the $140,020 SVR model, its 405kW supercharged 5.0-litre V8 launching it to 100km/h in 4.3-seconds and on to 283km/h. Expect bigger brakes, bespoke suspension, SVR body kit and suitably obnoxious exhaust sound to suit. Alfa Romeo Stelvio Q Arriving this month, Alfa’s $150,000 Stelvio Q is another ballistic mid-size premium SUV newbie. Numbers are epic — 375kW and 600Nm from its 2.9-litre bi-turbo V6 equals a physics-defying 0-100km/h time of 3.8 seconds. It’s possible thanks to an eight-speed auto that shifts gears in less than 100 milliseconds, a rear-bias all-wheel-drive system plus Alfa’s active torque vectoring. Leather, Alcantara, aluminium and carbon fibre are used inside, while the body boasts muscled wheel arches, bonnet vents and red brake calipers behind 20-inch alloys. Volvo V60 Volvo’s lauded XC40, XC60 and XC90 SUV line-up helped the Swedish brand’s sales grow by nearly 50 per cent last year, now comes a gorgeous new wagon, the V60. Longer and lower than the old version, the new V60 adopts the XC60’s platform, good looks and premium cabin but with a sleeker sports wagon shape. Expect a range of petrol engines, a T8 plug-in hybrid at some point and a start price of about $60k when it arrives in the third quarter. Lexus UX Toyota’s luxury arm is hopping on the small SUV bandwagon with the new sub-$45k UX. Front-drive petrols and hybrids are joined by a flagship AWD hybrid, each with a four-cylinder petrol engine — 125kW or 131kW with hybrid — and CVT gearbox. Sharing the Toyota C-HR’s architecture, the UX is designed to attract younger buyers to the brand with relatively cheap entry price and oodles of standard inclusions. Infiniti QX50 A new QX50 mid-size SUV, due by mid-year, will look to reverse a sales slide. The first commercially available car with a variable-compression engine, it cleverly adjusts compression ratio depending on load, promising excellent fuel economy. Expect semi-autonomous tech, sumptuous cabin, decent cargo room and a start price of about $60,000. Genesis G70 and G80 Hyundai’s stand-alone luxury brand Genesis will finally launch in Australia with the Mercedes C-Class rivalling G70 and BMW 5-Series-sized G80. Full specifications and pricing are still unknown but count on the brand trumping the competition on price and equipment to snare sales. When money is no object The new year will be a bumper one for supercars. There’s the new Porsche 911 starting from $265,000 for a 331kW Carrera S, a facelifted Audi R8 retaining its stonking V10 engine and hopefully a V8 Lexus LC F coupe. High-riding supercars are covered by Lamborghini’s $390,000 Urus SUV, good for 100km/h in 3.6 seconds thanks to its 478kW bi-turbo V8. Traditionalists will prefer Ferrari’s track-focused 533kW V8 488 Pista for $645,000. Not enough? Lean towards the Mercedes-AMG One — an F1 car for the road with more than 740kW from its electrically-enhanced 1.6-litre turbo V6. Eight versions are confirmed for Australia and New Zealand, each about $4 million. The same money buys an Aston Martin Valkyrie, with 746kW/740Nm and 11,100rpm redline from its naturally-aspirated 6.5-litre V12, or save millions and settle for a 597kW twin-turbo V8 McLaren Senna.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "The best luxury cars due in 2019", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Iain Curry", "sitename": "news.com.au", "image_url": null, "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8843852877616882, "responded_url": "https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/luxury/the-best-luxury-cars-due-in-2019/news-story/596fe0e329a3b73ae6bbb5468b59bace", "publisher": "news.com.au", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104185010-00081.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T20:18:08+00:00"}

Kanye West and Justin Timberlake were supposed to headline the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, but ultimately decided to forgo the gig, a source confirms to Us Weekly exclusively.  “Kanye backed out at the last minute because of the stage constrictions and he’s done performing on limiting stages and feels they restrict his artistic ability,” the insider explains. “He and Travis Scott are really committed to having unique sets going forward.”  The 37-year-old “Say Something” singer’s decision, however, came due to time constraints. “Justin’s tour schedule conflicted which is why he pulled out but he had wanted to do it and was excited about it,” the source adds.  Timberlake recently returned to his Man of the Woods tour after he postponed multiple concerts and took a two-month break due to severely bruised vocal cords. The former N’Sync member first alerted fans to his condition when he canceled his October show at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

{"requested_url": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/26496", "plain_text": "To Your Credit  The checkered history of the Research and Experimental Tax Credit (more commonly known as the R&D Credit, for research and development) has a certain \"now you see it, now you don't\" quality. In any given year, it's been difficult to know whether the credit is even allowed, and exactly which expenditures qualify have always been hazy as well. Yet this tax-reduction tool offers potentially powerful savings on the kinds of cost-reduction investments so many businesses are making today. In fact, according to Glenn Mackles, a principal in the national tax department of Deloitte & Touche LLP's Washington, DC, office, \"Savings of $20 million or more by large firms are now causing medium-sized and smaller companies to take a closer look at the R&D credit.\" Another reason for the new-found interest in the R&D tax credit: A recent U.S. Commerce Department pronouncement on the issue spelled out more clearly than ever before what qualifies as research and development. The upshot is a surprisingly more liberal interpretation than expected, says Mackles. One of the biggest changes, in Mackles' view, is that it's not just so-called \"research companies\" or companies \"in the R&D phase\" that qualify anymore. A large portion of the significant investments made in process engineering by many firms in recent years can probably be subtracted right from their tax bills. And while \"process engineering\" may sound far too high-tech for you, all it really means is figuring out how to make something better or how to deliver a service more efficiently. If you spent time and money doing this, a portion of those expenses qualifies for a tax credit, according to Mackles. Remember, too, that unlike a deduction, which simply reduces taxable income, a credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your tax bill. The credit can even be claimed for years past, Mackles says, albeit under guidelines \"only an accountant could love.\"  On Again, Off Again  It's not difficult to understand why the R&D tax credit has often been ignored by small business. For one thing, it has been killed off and reborn more times than Frankenstein on the big screen-six times since 1981. Every couple of years Congress allows it to expire, then revives it-for two to three years at a time-typically with credits approved retroactively for the hiatus. \"[The credit] has always been confusing and tough to obtain,\" says Carolyn Turnbull, associate partner with accounting firm Postlethwaite & Netterville in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and a member of the Shareholders and Corporations Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. \"Even when it was renewed or extended, few people knew it was retroactive.\" When the IRS last revived the R&D tax credit two years ago, few people bothered to take note. \"Who reads IRS regulations?\" says Mackles. Even now, the R&D credit is on hiatus; it expired June 30, 1995. But don't let that stop you from taking unrealized R&D tax credits from past years or from keeping proper records while you await yet another miraculous revival. Already, bills have been introduced to bring the credit back. \"There's a good deal more clarity now about what qualifies, and anybody who takes a second look will find a great deal of benefit,\" Mackles says. \"Because of the cost-cutting moves forced on companies right now, lots of money is being spent on finding cheaper, smarter, faster ways to make existing products or deliver services.\" While a simple definition of precisely what expenses qualify for the R&D credit remains somewhat elusive, Mackles says, \"About 95 percent of what qualifies are wages. Eligible salaries apply toward the credit on a prorated basis, and once 80 percent of an employee's time is devoted to R&D activities, you can deduct 100 percent of his or her salary.\" Although it's harder to do, you can also make a case that supplies used in the effort qualify as expenses; you can't, however, consider rent or other fixed costs qualified expenses. Explains Mackles, \"Bricks and mortar don't count, but supplies that get used up do.\"  Brace Yourself  Below, Mackles explains how to calculate your R&D credit. Don't try this at home without professional help. Because the credit expired June 30, 1995, it is available on a prorated basis for the first six months of that year. To make the math easier, we'll base our examples on 1994. 1. First, calculate average annual gross receipts for 1984-88. (For those not in business then, see step 3). Yes, it's a long time ago, and, yes, many of your accountants and employees from that time probably aren't around anymore, so getting accurate records won't be easy. But if it can save you a lot of money, it's worth doing. 2. Now figure out average annual R&D expenditures for the same five-year period. 3. Calculate a ratio of the two by dividing the average R&D spending by average gross receipts. Now you have a percentage. (If your company was formed after the base period, use 3 percent as a standard percentage.) 4. Figure the credit allowed for 1994. Take your average annual gross receipts from the previous four-year period (in this case, 1990-93), and multiply that by the percentage determined in steps 1 to 3 to get a dollar amount. The full credit for 1995 equals 20 percent of every eligible R&D expenditure above that amount. If your average annual gross receipts for 1990-93 were $3 million, and your ratio from step 3 was 2 percent, then 2 percent of $3 million is $60,000. That means 20 percent of whatever you spent on R&D above $60,000 can be subtracted directly from your tax bill as a credit. Technically, you can now claim credits for 1993, 1994 and the first half of 1995. For the many corporations planning to file 1995 returns in September under an extension, 1992 remains open to claims as well. The point of all this, from the government's side, is to encourage ongoing increases in R&D spending. That's why, as the math shows, if you want to qualify for credits year in and year out, actual dollars spent on R&D must continually rise. Remember, this is an incremental tax credit-it applies only to the 20 percent of R&D spending above a base amount. Of course, if you are filing under the Alternative Minimum Tax schedule, R&D credits would have to be carried forward.  Helping Hand  Mackles says firms usually recover three to eight times what it costs to claim the R&D credit. Typically, an accountant conducts a quick appraisal to gauge the likelihood of meaningful savings before plunging in too deep. Finally, a cautionary note: Remember that accountants' opinions and styles vary. Turnbull, for example, has strong reservations about how far R&D credits can be taken given the IRS' current language, especially when it comes to software and service companies. Still, she agrees the credits deserve attention. But while Mackles agrees that much of the language affecting R&D tax credits remains subject to interpretation, he says the big six accounting firms, at least, are moving ahead quickly on the issue. Already, dozens of clients at his firm have claimed this credit, and the activity is filtering down to smaller companies. Regardless of where you or your accountant fall on the risk-reward continuum of claiming credits and deductions, one time-honored dictum still applies that even Turnbull and Mackles can agree on: Keep the best possible records you can. If you want to take advantage of the R&D credit, you're going to need them.", "published_date": "1996-07-01", "title": "To Your Credit", "tags": "Money;Money", "categories": "", "author": "David R Evanson", "sitename": "Entrepreneur", "image_url": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20160408155709-default-hero-entrepreneur.png", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9644681215286255, "responded_url": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/26496", "publisher": "entrepreneur.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104185010-00081.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T20:20:59+00:00"}

He said it is the BJP which has done more injustice to the State by not implementing provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act than the Congress, which divided the State.  Participating in the Janmabhoomi-Maa Vooru programme at Achempeta of Guntur district on Thursday, Naidu recalled that the fact-finding committee set up by Pawan Kalyan had found that the Centre is yet to pay Rs 75,000 crore to the State.  “I want Pawan Kalyan to fight against the Centre for the release of funds to the State,’’ he said and added that there is a need to put up a united fight to get the State’s rightful share.  In the neighbouring Tamil Nadu, all parties unite for the State’s rights and the Centre yields to their pressure. However, the situation is not the same in AP as some parties are bowing before the Centre,’’ he said, hinting at the need for waging a united battle against the Centre.  Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on TDP’s alliance with the Congress, Naidu said the grand old party had included several provisions in the bifurcation Act. However, the BJP government failed to fulfil any of these promises, be it special category status or others. On Modi’s remarks that the TDP government was riddled with corruption, Naidu said AP was the third least corrupt State in the country. “It is the BJP which is riddled with corruption. The Modi government is involved in the `43,000-crore Rafale scam and Modi is maintaining silence over the issue.  “We are fighting against corruption. We have acted tough against those who were involved in AgriGold scam and arrested the accused. We will also ensure justice to the victims,’’ he said.  Reacting to the suspension of TDP MPs from Parliament, Naidu said the TDP would not be cowed down by such attempts and added that the party MPs would continue their fight for special category status.  The CM said the BJP had managed to win only a single seat in Telangana even after Modi toured the State thrice and a battery of BJP leaders, including party chief Amit Shah and chief ministers of three states, campaigned for the party candidates.  Refuting claims of Modi about Andhra people seeking a change of government, he said that the people of the country are seeking change of BJP government. “People are waiting to vote out NDA in the coming polls,” Naidu said.  Kuppam airport  Naidu, on the second day of his tour of Chittoor district, laid foundation-stone for the Kuppam airport at Vijilapuram in Rama Kuppam mandal of Kuppam constituency on Thursday. The airport will come up in 430 acres of land and the construction is likely to be completed in a year.

The state government has been preparing a detailed action plan since December 25 to help the two women offer darshan. Thrissur-based psychologist Prasad Amore, a key member of the team, pitched ‘The Invisible Gorilla Technique’ and mentally prepared them.  We even distracted the attention of police officers at Sannidhanam: Amore  Prasad Amore told Express: “Bindu and Kanakadurga were determined to offer darshan despite returning midway from trekking following widespread protests on December 24. Meticulous planning was made since they were shifted to a safe place under police protection.”  “We decided to use the famous ‘Invisible Gorilla Technique’ to deceive the protestors. We even distracted the attention of police officers camping at Sannidhanam. Only a few of them were aware of the operation. Four trial runs were conducted with dummy pilgrims to analyse the scenario and collect feedback. The mission was executed with such precision that no information was leaked,” said Amore.  Asked about the mission, State Police Chief Loknath Behera said he was not aware of the detailed planning that had gone into the bringing the two women to Sabarimala.  “Our agenda is simple. We’ve taken a position to offer support and protection to any woman who approaches us seeking help to offer prayers at Sabarimala,” Behera added.  What is Invisible Gorilla Technique  Invisible Gorilla Technique is nothing but creating inattentional blindness, also known as perceptual blindness. This is a psychological lack of attention, that is not associated with any vision defects or deficits. It is a technique in which an individual fails to perceive an unexpected stimulus that is in plain sight.  When it simply becomes impossible for one to attend to all the stimuli in a given situation, a temporary blindness effect can take place as a result; individuals fail to see objects or stimuli that are unexpected and quite often salient.  The term was coined by Arien Mack and Irvin Rock in 1992. It is a psychological phenomenon known as inattentional blindness.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "How a psychologist helped Bindu and Kanakadurga enter Sabarimala", "tags": "Womens Entry, Invisible Gorilla Technique, Bindu and Kanaka Durga", "categories": "Kerala", "author": "Ajay Kanth", "sitename": "The New Indian Express", "image_url": "http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2019/1/4/w600X390/WhatsApp_Imagse_2019-01-02_at_2.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9780921339988708, "responded_url": "http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2019/jan/04/two-womens-entry-it-was-invisible-gorilla-technique-1920247.html", "publisher": "newindianexpress.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104185010-00081.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T20:24:14+00:00"}

But the smooth running of home games at Elland Road also relies on the support of a small army of staff who work around the stadium. And now people in Leeds have got the chance to join the United set-up as the club aims to mark its centenary year by winning promotion back to the Premier League. A recruitment open day is being held at Elland Road on Tuesday, January 15, for matchday roles including kiosk staff, cooks, bar workers and waiters. Looking ahead to the event, a United spokeswoman said: “It would be great to get as many people as we can to come along. “We’re looking for a number of hospitality, bar and waiting staff to work on matchdays and those that are successful will play a really important role in ensuring our supporters have the best experience when visiting Elland Road. “It’s an exciting season to be a part of the club so please come along if you’re interested.” United’s stalwart off-the-field staff over the decades have included Annie Cochrane, a catering team member who appeared in the Yorkshire Evening Post last February after clocking up more than 15 years at Elland Road. Head groundsman Kiel Barrett was the subject of a YEP feature in 2016, revealing some of the tricks of his trade and saying: “I love the work – it’s more like a hobby than a job.” Radio Leeds’s Simon Peters became a familiar voice for United fans during the club’s glory years under Don Revie, acting as matchday announcer.

What lingers from that transaction is the someone who might not be a Yankee, that someone being Manny Machado or Miguel Andújar or, perhaps, Tulowitzki. This is not because Tulowitzki has, today, locked down shortstop or third base or any position for the Yankees, as there’ll be no knowing who or what Tulowitzki can be until there are weeks or months of daily baseball behind him. He could be great again. He could break down again. There’s also a lot of room between those outcomes. Time — and repetitions, and recovery from those repetitions — will tell. He is a great bargain, which is why more than a dozen teams sent scouts to watch him chase fungoes and swing at 60-mph fastballs a couple weeks back. He was light on his feet, particularly for a 34-year-old. If you didn’t know he hadn’t played in a year-and-a-half, you’d have thought this was just ol’ Tulo cranking it up for spring training. He’s lean and seemed happy and when all the scouts went home he worked out for another 90 minutes, his body is telling him it can do this, and maybe it’ll cooperate for the next five years or so. Meantime, he’ll be a Yankee, which has seemed to appeal to him. For years he’d worn No. 2 in celebration of Derek Jeter. He visited Yankee Stadium in the middle of the 2014 season, Jeter’s last, only not with the rest of the Colorado Rockies. Tulowitzki was on the disabled list. He went on his own. A year and a day later, he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays. More injuries came. More down time. More prime years spent watching baseball. He became a free agent for the first time about a month ago, if not in the manner he’d ever envisioned, then sorted through his options, then picked the Yankees, regardless of whether they’ll have a position for him to play. Or perhaps he knows — or suspects — otherwise. You’d understand the Yankees’ desire to have him. He is, at best, capable of being Tulo, once among the finer ballplayers of his generation, and still with time to be productive again. He is insurance against Didi Gregorius’ recovery from Tommy John surgery, against trading Andújar for pitching, against some other catastrophic injury, against failing to land Machado. Until Machado makes his choice (the Yankees were believed to be in the running, along with the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White Sox) or until the Yankees withdraw from the bidding on Machado, Tulowitzki, in a position to choose his perfect scenario, couldn’t know what awaits in the Bronx. He has told those close to him he would be agreeable to coming off shortstop for the right situation, and has also said he is not willing to become a utility player. If he is to assume a comeback, he’ll need at-bats, regular at-bats and a regular position. He may need his own backup, for that matter. That leaves whatever conversations he or his agent may have had with the Yankees leading to Tulowitzki’s decision, or Tulowitzki’s strong desire to be a Yankee today and his willingness to sort out the specific details of it some other day, or some other information yet to reveal itself. Maybe he just couldn’t wait for the Yankees’ winter to play out. Maybe he has an idea of how it will.

A poor festive period for the Potters plus growing opposition from disillusioned fans has left Rowett on the brink, less than eight months after he left Derby County to take the job at Stoke.  A victory at Shrewsbury Town tomorrow in the FA Cup is the absolute minimum needed by the 44-year-old former Burton and Birmingham boss to keep his job, but it appears Stoke’s hierarchy could already be moving to replace him.  He reports: “Stoke had wanted to appoint the 55-year-old Scot midway through last season before moving for Paul Lambert, but Moyes had only just joined West Ham as manager.  “His short-term contract at West Ham finished at the end of last season and he has been out of work ever since, but it remains to be seen whether he would be interested in the event of Rowett’s departure.”  The Mirror claimed earlier this week that both Moyes and former Bolton, Newcastle, Everton and England boss Sam Allardyce were in the frame to take over at the bet365 Stadium, while many fans are keen on the ex-Watford and Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic.  However, Moyes fits the bill as an establish British manager more likely to work within Stoke’s established player recruitment framework alongside Scholes and technical director Mark Cartwright.  Stoke have won just one of their last five games, and a New Year’s Day defeat to Bristol City leaves them 14th in the Championship table, eight points off the top six play-off places.  Stoke chairman Peter Coates, a known admirer of Moyes, said in September that finishing outside the play-offs would have to be considered a failure by a club who were installed as pre-season title favorites following their relegation from the Premier League in May.  Moyes, a former Celtic centre-half, made his name as a manager at Preston North End while Tony Scholes was chief executive at Deepdale.

Bofors was a scam but Rafale is not one,” a combative Sitharaman said referring to the scandal involving purchase of Bofors guns during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure as Prime Minister in late 1980s, which led to the fall of his government.  Amid the heated debate, she said under the agreement signed by the NDA government, the cost of each of the 36 aircraft is 9 per cent lesser than that proposed in the deal signed by the previous UPA government.  Giving details, the Defence Minister said the cost of each basic Rafale aircraft proposed to be bought by the UPA government as per inflationary escalation was Rs 737 crore whereas the price of basic fighter under NDA government is Rs 670 crore each.  A basic fighter aircraft is without armament and electronic warfare systems.  The previous UPA government had proposed to procure 126 aircraft for the IAF and Rafale, manufactured by the French company Dassault, had emerged the lowest bidder in a tendering process.  Under that proposal, 18 fighters were to be bought in flyway condition and rest were to be manufactured in India.  However, the deal could not finally fructify and the NDA government in 2015 decided to by 36 Rafale aircraft in flyway condition.  “If national security and the sense of urgency was there, why didn't you (Congress) bring aircraft to India? The IAF procurement was weakest under the UPA regime. China and Pakistan are building a bigger fleet. The UPA government wanted only 18 flyaway fighter jets. UPA created a deadlock,” she said.  \"We (Central Government) don't do defence dealings. We deal in defence with national security as a priority,\" she added.  The Minister informed the House that the first Rafale aircraft will be delivered to India in September 2019 and 36 aircraft will be delivered in the year 2022.  Replying to allegations that due processes were not followed, Sitharaman said negotiations were held between May 2015 and completed in 14 months.  The Rafale jet deal controversy has been on the boil over the last few months. The Congress and other opposition parties have been alleging irregularities in the high-profile deal. The fighter jet is a twin-engine Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft, which security analysts believe can be a 'game-changer' for India's defence system.  In its judgment, the court stated that there is \"no occasion to really doubt the process\", delivering a major victory to the government and lending a setback to the Congress which has been alleging corruption in the agreement.

Unfortunately for those in attendance, the property’s future is still in limbo.  With a large crowd overflowing the multipurpose room where the commission meets, a rezoning request to turn the Garden City golf course into a mixed-use housing development project was voted down.  Following much debate, and a speech from South Carolina Sen. Stephen Goldfinch, the commission nixed the recommendation, going against the Horry County planning staff’s approval.  Digital Access for only $0.99  For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.  #ReadLocal  This does not, however, mean the golf course will be saved.  Interim Planning Director David Schwerd said homes can still be built on the property under its current zoning code of SF6, which allows for residential homes on minimum lot sizes of 6,000 square feet. The Horry County planning staff asked to create plans for it if the rezoning was not approved. Under the SF6 zoning, the developers could build 693 total units of both single-family lots and duplexes, as long as it meets county standards.  “The developer could turn around tomorrow and start working on it,” commission chair Steven Neeves said.  SF6 does not allow for commercial properties.  The rezoning request discussed Thursday actually would have allowed fewer homes. The property owners, Founders Group International, hoped to turn the golf course into a mix of townhomes, single-family homes and some commercial businesses. Nearly 500 homes would be built in total, with 255 single-family lots and 257 townhomes. The commercial possibilities would have to be “community retail services,” per the zoning code the owners requested.  Under county requirements, the property owners would be required to make necessary improvements for traffic and stormwater draining. Some of the specific plans on how to do those were still in the works. A traffic study of the Garden City Connector was completed and will be reviewed by staff, but Thom Roth with Horry County Stormwater said he had not seen the complete plans for retaining stormwater on the property.  “But they are requirements,” Roth said, speaking to the high standards stormwater regulations in Horry County that require slower discharge than normal. “How they meet them, I don’t know yet. But they have to.”  Schwerd said people often assume golf courses are good at absorbing water, and developing them could lead to less flood protections, but in fact they’re designed to get rid of moisture as quickly as possible.  “If anybody plays golf, the whole idea is to get the water off the course as fast as possible into the ponds,” he said. “Apparently that’s where my balls go.”  Goldfinch said the agent for the property owner, Walter Warren of Thomas & Hutton Engineering firm, has been great to work with, but this plan was “putting lipstick on a pig.” Goldfinch thanked the commission for participating in civil service and asked Warren if he would differ so that improvements could be made to the plan and “turn it into bacon.”  “And who doesn’t like bacon?” said Goldfinch, who spoke on behalf of the people living in the community, expressing concerns over traffic, the viability of commercial businesses in the community and other issues.  The rezoning request will still go on to Horry County Council, even though it was not recommended by the planning commission. The council could technically ignore the commission’s recommendation.  “I encourage you to see this through the process,” Neeves said.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Indian Wells gets a no vote from planning.

With just two days left in the winter session, the speaker could consider a request from All India Anna Dravidra Munnetra Kazagham (AIADMK) leader and Lok Sabha deputy speaker M Thambidurai who on Friday urged her to revoke the suspension with a condition that they will not disrupt the proceedings again. Mahajan had suspended 24 AIADMK members on Wednesday for five consecutive sittings and then 20 members of the AIADMK and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) besides an unattached member who had won on a YSR Congress Party ticket. While AIADMK members were protesting over a proposed dam on river Cauvery, the TDP has continuously raised its demand for special category state status to Andhra Pradesh. The action was taken under rule 374A of the Lok Sabha which says that they cannot attend the remaining days of the session, which concludes on January 8. Thambidurai made the request during the Zero Hour, to which the speaker replied that the situation had become “unbearable” “Madam you have the right to take the action, I am not objecting to that. I know any violation cannot be tolerated. At the same time, members are also agitated about their issues. My request is to pardon them. As only two days of this session are left,” he said. The deputy speaker agreed that the members should not enter the Well of the House. “You have already punished them, so I now humbly request as a custodian of this House, please pardon them. Allow them to participate from Monday in the proceedings of this House. At the same time they should not enter the Well of the House,” he said. The speaker said the behaviour of suspended members was sending a “very bad message” to the public. “Who will give the assurance that they will not enter the Well of the House.This is sending a very bad message about MPs who represent lakhs of people. We should discuss this in our chamber. All leaders should come together and discuss this issue,” she said. The speaker also described some of the scenes witnessed in the House as “ugly” and maintained that “unbearable things” were happening in the House.

{"requested_url": "https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bird-box-house-20190104-story.html", "plain_text": "Miles away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood is a house that has quickly cemented its place in movie history.  Nestled beneath a large evergreen tree, the Craftsman-style home with a distinguished stone staircase on the corner of North Canyon Boulevard and East Greystone Avenue provided a refuge from an evil force in Netflix’s recent hit thriller “Bird Box.”  Now, the Monrovia home has become the latest tourist attraction in Los Angeles County. Fans of the movie have flocked to the house to take pictures of themselves covering their eyes or wearing blindfolds on the steps leading up to the property.  The pilgrimage follows a long tradition of movie buffs’ visiting homes across L.A. that have had starring roles on the silver screen. Monrovia homes and commercial areas have been used for years in films such as “Legally Blonde,” “American Pie” and “Never Been Kissed.”  The owner of the seven-bedroom house, which was built in 1908 by architect Frank O. Eager, couldn’t be reached for comment Friday. However, she reportedly received $12,000 for exterior shots of the house that were featured in the movie.  When Diana Hernandez of Chino told her two teenage daughters they were going on an adventure Friday morning, she received groans. But that quickly changed as the family made their way down Canyon Boulevard.  Hernandez’s daughter, Abby Olague, 15, said she “totally freaked out” when she spotted the house.  Abby tried multiple poses in front of the house with one hand over her eyes and another reaching out as if to feel her way up the stairs. Eventually, she used a thick white headband she found in her mother’s car as a makeshift blindfold, capturing the ideal shot and replicating the premise of the movie.  “Just seeing the house, it almost makes you want to go in — even though you know the characters aren’t going to be there,” she said. “This was a good surprise.”  Abby was the first in her family to see the film starring Sandra Bullock, which has amassed a significant global following since its Dec. 21 release.  Netflix announced this week that 45 million subscriber accounts across the world watched the thriller during its first seven days on the streaming service, a record debut for the company.  The film has amassed such a following that Netflix had to warn fans not to hurt themselves participating in the newly created “Bird Box Challenge.” The premise takes the core concept of the film — wearing a blindfold at all times — and applies it to daily activities.  Some fans arrived at the home in search of an expertly cultivated photo for their social media feeds. Others brought jokes along with their cameras.  Northridge resident Jonathan Bugnosen used a trip to the house to take photos with his daughters as an opportunity to cultivate a cringe-worthy pun.  He chuckled as he pulled a green Celtics basketball jersey out of a black Nike shoe box. He slipped the jersey over his long-sleeved shirt and turned around to reveal the player’s last name on the back: Bird.  He held up the shoe box and grinned.  “Bird Box,” he said. “It’s the ultimate dad joke.”  His daughters rolled their eyes.  A man driving past the house paused at a stop sign in front of the home and rolled down his window, clearly baffled at the spectacle.  “What’s going on?” he shouted.  “He hasn’t seen it?” someone in the crowd retorted with a mixture of disbelief and amusement. Another fan quickly explained the house was featured in a film.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Fans flock to 'Bird Box' house in Monrovia to pose in photos as craze over film soars", "tags": "monrovia, bird box, bird box challenge, california, netflix, sandra bullock, canyon boulevard, selfie;Netflix, Sandra Bullock, Jace Fry", "categories": "", "author": "Hannah Fry", "sitename": "Los Angeles Times", "image_url": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/_S_GteIXAqQQlR_nosZ4-3Yu2wA=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RN2D3HWVPNBW5CPUKNJV5BEJII.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9762712121009827, "responded_url": "https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bird-box-house-20190104-story.html", "publisher": "latimes.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104220826-00082.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T23:36:27+00:00"}

The album title, When A Shadow Is Forced Into The Light, comes from Aleah’s own words, ‘When a shadow is forced into the light.’ That was exactly what I needed to do. To push myself out from the shadows. I’ve been pretty much a hermit in the woods for two and a half years. Gathering my life to write this album. That’s also why the subject is very personal and therefore hard for me to talk about. I’d rather leave it all to the music and words on When A Shadow Is Forced Into The Light to tell the story. It’s all there.”  Listen to “Upon The Water” below, and pre-order the album here.  Fueled by personal loss (the album title has its origins in Trees Of Eternity's “Broken Mirror”) and powered by the will to continue, When A Shadow Is Forced Into The Light showcases the group’s ability to maintain its signature sound while expanding upon horizons and diving deeper into the crevasse of doom-death metal. While the previous released single “Lumina Aurea” marks the band’s darkest and most sinister piece of music the band has ever released, When A Shadow Is Forced Into The Light follows a more positive approach and continues in the vein of previous albums – first-rate death-doom in the typical style of Swallow The Sun.

{"requested_url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-impeachment-talk-2020-20190104-story.html", "plain_text": "President Donald Trump sought Friday to push back against talk of impeaching him that has intensified since Democrats took back control of the House, arguing that his adversaries want to remove him for office because of his popularity and success. \"They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020, too much success!\" Trump wrote in one of two tweets Friday morning that addressed the subject. House Democratic leaders have sought to tamp down immediate talk of impeachment, counseling that they should wait for special counsel Robert Mueller III to file a report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. But as the new Congress convened on Thursday, several rank-and-file members were vocal about the prospect of removing Trump from office. One announced he was filing articles of impeachment while another made headlines overnight by calling for Trump's removal in profane terms at a gathering hosted by a liberal group.  \"How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?\" Trump wrote on Twitter. Under the Constitution, presidents can be impeached and removed from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" In a television interview that aired Thursday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said that the House's actions regarding impeachment should be guided by an anticipated report from Mueller, who is probing whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russia and whether Trump has tried to obstruct the investigation. \"We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report,\" Pelosi said in on NBC's \"Today\" show. \"We shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason. So we'll just have to see how it comes.\"  Under the Constitution, presidents can be removed from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\". Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., meanwhile, announced that he was introducing articles of impeachment against Trump, whom he accused of obstructing justice by firing former FBI director James Comey in 2017, among other alleged misdeeds. And overnight, a video clip went viral of Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., saying Democrats should \"impeach the motherf-----\" at an event hosted by the advocacy group MoveOn.org at a bar near the Capitol. Asked about those comments during an appearance Friday morning on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders echoed some of the sentiments in Trump's tweets.  \"Look, you're not going to impeach this president when he's had two of the most successful years that any president has had in modern history,\" Sanders said. \"The only reason they want to come after this president is because they know they can't beat him. ... They have no solutions for America.\" She added: \"I hope some of these new faces that campaigned on being different and being a change will actually come here to work with the president, work for solutions and actually look to help the American people, not to help their own political careers.\" Though Trump has remained popular among Republicans, his overall job approval stood at 39 percent in the most recent Gallup tracking poll. It was unclear Friday how much restraint Democrats would show in talking about impeachment. Asked about Tlaib's comments during an appearance on CNN, Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., said: \"Well, passions are running high. Let's just leave it at that, OK?\" She then repeated Pelosi's line about need to let the Mueller investigation play out. \"Then we'll take it from there,\" she said. Republicans, meanwhile, sought to turn the tables on Democrats, claiming they aren't interested in getting things done. \"Look at the brand new elected congresswoman and her language,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said on Fox News, referring to Tlaib. \"Their whole focus here is to try and attack this president when we're trying to move America forward.\" In his tweets Friday morning, Trump also sought to play down the recent volatility of the financial markets. \"As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets,\" he said. \"We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down.\"", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Trump pushes back on impeachment talk, citing his popularity among Republicans", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "John Wagner", "sitename": "chicagotribune.com", "image_url": "https://www.trbimg.com/img-5c2f7115/turbine/ct-trump-impeachment-talk-2020-20190104", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9827089905738831, "responded_url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-impeachment-talk-2020-20190104-story.html", "publisher": "chicagotribune.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104133413-00079.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T15:14:16+00:00"}

Lloyd Billingsley • Thursday January 3, 2019 1:30 PM PST • During his last eight years in office, California governor Jerry Brown issued 283 commutations and 1,332 pardons. During his final weeks in office, the state Supreme Court denied seven of Brown’s clemency requests as an “abuse of power.” It was the first time the state’s high court had done so in more than half a century, and the rejections seem fully justified. The governor’s candidates included Kenny Lee, who murdered a cab driver, and fellow murderers Huan Nguyen, Joe Hernandez, Howard Ford, and Borey Ai. All had deprived their victims of the most basic right, the right to live.  In one of his last acts as governor, Brown ordered new testing of evidence in the case of Kevin Cooper, on death row for the slayings of Doug and Peggy Ryen, their 10-year-old daughter Jessica and neighbor Christopher Hughes in 1983. Former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger twice rejected Cooper’s petitions for clemency, and prosecutors oppose the new testing. There was no need for Brown to intervene in the case or commute the sentence of any murderer.  In September, Brown heard testimony from five families victimized by juvenile murderers, one a double murder of victims 87 and 76 years old, with torture and hideous mutilation. In a signing statement, Brown said the testimony “weighed on me”—but only after he approved Senate Bill 1391, which bars all prosecution of juveniles as adults, whatever the gravity of their crime.  While approving new incentives for violent criminals, Jerry Brown has made it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves.  He approved a batch of new gun laws that raise the age for purchase of rifles and shotguns to 21, allow confiscation of guns in certain cases, and even require a background check for the purchase of ammunition. As Stephen Halbrook showed in Gun Control in Nazi-Occupied France, such measures are more characteristic of totalitarian states.  Before leaving office, Brown also pardoned state senator Rod Wright, convicted of felony perjury and voting fraud. Brown also pardoned former state education boss Bill Honig, convicted on felony conflict-of-interest charges during the 1990s. The state supreme court did not challenge Brown’s pardon of corrupt politicians and bureaucrats, though Californians could be forgiven for seeing it as an abuse of power. Like Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine) in Being There, Jerry Brown reveals himself to himself, and he is drenched and purged.  ***  K.

{"requested_url": "https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/controversial-plans-make-full-sutton-2391229", "plain_text": "New, bigger plans for a huge prison facility in East Yorkshire have been submitted to the council.  The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) wants to build a new Category C facility accommodating more than 1,400 male prisoners on the site of the existing Full Sutton prison near Pocklington.  Despite receiving outline planning permission (OPA) for a new 1,017-inmate £91m \"super prison\" in July 2017, the MoJ is now seeking a 42 per cent increase to the planned capacity, housing a total of 1,440 prisoners.  If approved, the number of proposed house blocks would rise to six instead of four, with 17 buildings - six more than previously planned - being constructed on the site.  A total of 720 staff will be needed to run the prison, which will involve a local recruitment drive to fill an estimated 389 positions while further jobs will be created during construction.  The plans form part of the Government's £1.3bn prison estate transformation programme, which aims to tackle overcrowding in cells by creating 10,000 new jail spaces by 2020.  In the planning statement, the applicant says: \"The proposed new prison will provide greater opportunity for offenders from the region to be held closer to their home areas, which is an important factor in reducing re-offending rates.  \"Moreover, the investment in a new prison will provide a significant boost to the local economy.  \"The decision to promote a new prison at Full Sutton is based on a national priority of promoting modernisation and efficiency in the operational prison estate.  \"The decision to provide new space in the region is driven by strategic needs for Category C, Adult Male capacity, and the benefits that would arise in terms of offender rehabilitation of providing prison places on the application site.\"  Watch: 12 dangerous criminals locked up in December  The existing HMP Full Sutton provides the highest level of security and houses the most dangerous category A and B prisoners . It was constructed in 1987 and as of March 2018 it has an operational capacity of 558 adult male prisoners.  However, the new facility is set to be designed to hold Category C male prisoners who are not trusted to be in an open prison but are considered unlikely to try to escape.  The applicant adds: \"The majority of changes are driven by the increase in capacity, although others arise from the MoJ having refined its thinking on the design of buildings to be delivered in new developments since 2017. Nonetheless, there are many similarities between the Proposed Site Layout submitted in 2017 and that submitted in support of the 2018 proposals.  \"The anticipated heights of the buildings have reduced from the assumptions made in 2017. The current indicative building heights are all within the maximum indicated for each building at the time of the 2017 OPA, and some are substantially lower. This is balanced by the inclusion of the two additional house blocks.\"  Two public exhibition days were held in November, with more than 100 people attending events in both Full Sutton and nearby Stamford Bridge.  Meanwhile, Full Sutton and Skirpenbeck Parish Council held an extraordinary meeting during the same month, which was well attended by parishioners and representatives from neighbouring communities and councils.  In a statement, the parish council said: \"Within the meeting it was made clear that there was a unanimous mandate to start to start to formulate an objection to the proposal, as well as a continued objection to the outline planning permission already granted for a smaller version of the prison.  Have your say in our poll below  Do you think the Full Sutton expansion should go ahead?  0+ VOTES SO FAR  \"Full Sutton and Skirpenbeck Parish Council are currently formulating a plan and an initial detailed statement to East Riding Council , MOJ, Ministers and the local MP Sir Greg Knight.\"  Members of the public are invited to comment on the application, which can viewed here.  The application is expected to reach East Riding Council’s planning committee in March, where the proposals will be considered by councillors. If the latest outline planning application is approved, the MoJ will then need to submit a full planning application.

He said when the truck was 150 feet away from them, he feared for the couple’s safety and fired several “warning shots” at the vehicle. He told police he then fired several more shots as the vehicle turned away from them and drove away, hitting the truck several times.  He said he fired again when the truck stopped because he feared the occupants might be retrieving a weapon and he wanted them to leave.  Police located the truck and its four occupants, who reported they were going to hunt rabbits and followed a road that took them near Patterson’s encampment. They said they drove by the first time, and were shot at unexpectedly as they returned about an hour later on that same road.  The group said Patterson shot at them, stopped to reload, and then fired more shots before getting in his own vehicle and chasing them.  Police found bullet holes in the truck, one of which was “only inches away from the glass where the rear passenger was seated.”  Police investigated the area and found numerous well used roads and pull outs in the area—which is a popular place for RVs, ATVs and other outdoor recreation.  Officers determined Patterson had not been in any danger when he fired at the vehicle and in their view “was not justified in using deadly force.”  Patterson was booked into the Purgatory Correctional Facility on the four counts of aggravated assault with a weapon.", "published_date": "2019-01-04", "title": "Man arrested for firing several shots at passing vehicle told police ‘he feared for his safety’", "tags": "local, news, assault, shooting", "categories": "Local;News", "author": "Rebecca Green", "sitename": "fox13now.com", "image_url": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/010419-daniel-patterson.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9922661781311035, "responded_url": "https://fox13now.com/2019/01/04/man-arrested-for-firing-several-shots-at-passing-vehicle-told-police-he-feared-for-his-safety/", "publisher": "fox13now.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104133413-00079.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T15:26:38+00:00"}

Fresh demonstrations hit several towns and cities after a 46-year-old Sri Lankan woman became the third female of “menstruating age” to enter the Sabarimala temple complex, late on Thursday.  The woman known only as Sasikala is the third female under 50 - after Bindu Ammini, 42, and Kanakadurga, 44 - to offer prayers at the hilltop shrine, triggering violence across the state, police said on Friday.  Sasikala entered the temple 10 minutes before it was due to close on Thursday night, accompanied by her husband. She claimed her uterus was removed after an operation meaning she does not qualify as a menstruating women, the Hindustan Times reported.  A curfew was enforced in some parts of the state as police took part in Operation Broken Window, designed to quell mass disturbances after a general strike was called by a number of Right-wing Hindu groups.  The row stems from a supreme court ruling in September that declared it illegal for the Sabarimala temple to deny access to female worshippers on the grounds that menstruation offends the celibate deity Lord Ayyappa.  The state government, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has supported the rights of women to enter the temple, leading to religious extremists labelling them and Pinarayi Vijayan, the the chief minister, “godless atheists”.  Kerala police on Friday said they will step up security for the chief minister following threats over the temple controversy.  TK Vinodkumar, chief of the police intelligence wing, said though Mr Vijayan will continue to be in the highest security category, some extra security measures had been taken.  Also in an incident never seen before in the state, 24 buses of the Kerala Road Transport Corporation, which had their broken windows during protests, were paraded on the streets of the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram.  The bus leading the procession carried a banner which read, “I am not responsible for this.

George Garrett, vice-president of Volunteer Cancer Drivers Society, said the need for drivers who speak the two languages “has been increasing over the last couple of years.”  Garrett said the patients being driven to appointments “are much more comfortable if they’re speaking their own languages.” He added that sometimes families are able to send along another family member who speaks English to tag along for the trip to the appointment.  If the society is unable to match a patient with a driver who speaks their language, Garret said, “we just have to have an English-speaking driver who tries their best.”  Drivers develop “a bond” with their patients as they can be driving together “quite often,” Garrett said. He added that for someone going through radiation treatment, the patient could have “30-some treatments in six weeks.”  However, Garrett said, “it’s more than just a ride.”  “It’s companionship and someone a patient can talk to in confidence,” Garrett said. “Sometimes sharing some bad news, sometimes laughter in the car.  “Our drivers are very compassionate.”  And they have to be with the kilometres they’ve driven since the society’s inception.  Back in December, drivers hit a milestone of one million kilometres driven. Volunteers also donated 62,000 hours of their time.  “The drivers themselves are our biggest donor group,” said Garrett of the volunteer drivers who donate their gas money back to the society.  In the summer, Garrett told Black Press Media that an increased demand and rising gas costs could for the all-volunteer service to dip into its cash reserve.  Garret told the Now-Leader that not much has changed since the summer with the most expensive area being Abbotsford-Langley.  “As it turns out, the cost in the Langley-Abbotsford district is as high as $49 per trip.”  Volunteer Cancer Drivers Society began on Feb. 29, 2016 to replace the previous service cancelled by the Canadian Cancer Society in 2015.  “We have grown from a handful of volunteer drivers at the beginning to the point where we now have 175 volunteer drivers (men and women) and 10 dispatchers,” a press release from the society reads.

{"requested_url": "http://www.ibtimes.sg/what-expect-ces-2019-5g-smartphones-ar-vr-updates-more-28799", "plain_text": "CES 2019, the tech industry's biggest event of the year, is right around the corner. This means we'll see a patch of the future we all could have, from faster hardware to smarter gadgets. Of course, not everything will be readily available instantly. Some will be just concepts. Others will be released months or even years away. With technology rapidly advancing, we'll see how game-changing — or even life-changing — this year's inventions are going to be. But to give you an inkling of what could be announced, here are our predictions for this year's CES. Introducing 5G With Qualcomm's announcement of a 5G-capable chipset last December, 5G's going to be what's on people's mouths at CES 2019. While details about the next generation of connectivity remains scarce, 5G capability can become a huge upgrade from what we currently have. It's expected to have average speeds of around 1GBps or have incredibly low latency down to 1ms. It's also expected to go beyond just phones, so other 5G hardware is quite possible. Smarter smart homes Last year, smart homes were the ones that were most talked about at CES. The surge of popularity of smart home devices, such as Google Home and Amazon's Alexa, makes such gadgets a staple in the trade show. Google itself stole the show last year, and this year, it is poised to conquer the show again with its smart ecosystem and Google Assistant. AR/VR getting closer to reality There's a push for smaller, cheaper, or even standalone virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Go. VR's in a good place, that much is certain. But for the augmented reality, there's uncertainty. Demand for AR content isn't as strong as developers expected. And if there's a place to convince consumers to get into AR, it's going to be CES. So, expect more AR peripherals and software on display. Smartphones — faster and foldable? With 5G near the horizon, it means CES 2019 might have 5G smartphones on display. The past years, we've only seen concepts and prototypes of bendable/flexible devices. Samsung's announcement and unveiling of its foldable smartphone in November changed all that. But with the Mobile World Congress coming next month, we might not see foldable smartphones at CES just yet. TVs More 8K Displays? How about a rollable TV with Alexa integration? While we won't see any 12K or 16K TVs yet, we'll see more improvements on how we can watch content on our screens. Reports have suggested Samsung's \"The Wall,\" a gigantic wall display made of microLED tiles, will have a scaled down version. There's also the new HDMI 2.1 Standard that allows for better 8K content delivery and improved high dynamic range content for 4K TVs. And yes — voice control for TVs, whether it's Alexa or Google Assistant. This article was first published in IBTimes US.

Thankfully, the company is completely rebuilding Apple Maps from the ground up. Starting in the iOS 12 beta and starting with Cupertino, this reinvention of Apple Maps isn’t just going to be from Apple updating the existing app with new city records and third-party map data – Apple has invested in its own mapping tech to rival Google Maps, according to TechCrunch.  Apple’s fleet of advanced mapping vans, similar to Google Street View cars that gather data and photos at a street level, is finally going to put its data to use this year. The new Apple vans are strapped with LiDAR arrays and eight overlapping cameras along with the standard measuring tools. The most interesting map-curation tool at Apple’s disposal, however, is your iPhone. Apple already gathers location data from iPhones, but it will be doing this even more from here on out in an effort to change the map real-time. It doesn’t end at the iPhone and street level, either. Apple has deployed satellites to gather even more data and satellite imagery. It will then be cross-referenced with the street level data so that the maps are as accurate as possible. Mapping out the future For the longest time, Google has reigned supreme when it came to Google Maps, but now Apple wants a shot at giving it some serious competition. Apple Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services Eddie Cue even goes as far as to say he hopes Apple will have “the best map app in the world”. This means you can expect more consistent Apple Maps updates outside of year-to-year iOS refreshes. Apple says it will use location data to “change the map real-time and often”, which means you should be notified to sudden changes to your route. If Apple is able to build an infrastructure that uses this its own van and iPhone data to create a constantly updated map, the third-party Google Maps might not be everyone’s default app choice anymore when they’re looking for directions. For anyone worried about their data anonymity, Apple says you don’t need to worry – the company promises it will collect data from its users in a privacy-first manner in order to update map data on the fly with new street and heavy traffic changes. It will only collect data in bits and pieces and never know a person traveled from point A to point B.", "published_date": "2018-06-29", "title": "Apple Maps is still terrible, but Apple is doing something about it", "tags": "", "categories": "", "author": "Bill Thomas", "sitename": "TechRadar", "image_url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X6HpZvezNoW9SGqXBXMp4Q-1200-80.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.94922935962677, "responded_url": "https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/apple-maps-is-still-terrible-but-apple-is-doing-something-about-it", "publisher": "techradar.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190104161229-00080.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-04T17:46:35+00:00"}

The announcement was made during a meeting of top officials from the Central Military Commission (CMC), which Xi Jinping heads.  \"All military units must correctly understand major national security and development trends, and strengthen their sense of unexpected hardship, crisis and battle\", he said, adding that China's armed forces must \"prepare for a comprehensive military struggle from a new starting point\".  \"Preparation for war and combat must be deepened to ensure an efficient response in times of emergency\", he said.  Xi has engaged in a campaign to boost the People's Liberation Army's readiness since he became the president of China in 2012, SCMP reports, adding that in 2019 this effort will intensify.  The two key points of conflict for China are the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost entirely; and the issue of Taiwan, which China views as a runaway province and seeks to reunify it with the mainland.  The US is the main opponent in both areas. Washington insists on \"ensuring freedom of navigation\" in the South China Sea, which effectively means dispatching ships and aircraft to patrol the waters, something that has already led to several near-misses between the powers. Washington has also shown significant support for Taiwan, opposing Chinese claims to the island. Despite having no official embassy on the island, the US de facto uses the American Institute in Taiwan for this role.  According to Yue Gang, a retired PLA colonel, the United States would do good to use the conflict points as bargaining chips in the ongoing trade war with China, instead of risking a deadly escalation.  \"Over the coming year, the US might use Taiwan and the South China Sea as bargaining chips to get what it wants from China with regards to the trade war\", he said, according to the South China Morning Post.", "published_date": "2019-01-05", "title": "China's Xi Commands Armed Forces to be Battle-Ready – Report", "tags": "preparations, war, speech, Chinese Peoples Liberation Army (PLA), Xi Jinping, South China Sea, China, Taiwan, United States", "categories": "", "author": null, "sitename": "SputnikInt", "image_url": "https://cdn5.img.sputniknews.com/images/107121/79/1071217986.jpg", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9622001051902771, "responded_url": "https://sputniknews.com/asia/201901051071234450-china-get-ready-for-war/", "publisher": "sputniknews.com", "warc_path": "https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/2019/01/CC-NEWS-20190105073009-00084.warc.gz", "crawl_date": "2019-01-05T09:48:38+00:00"}
