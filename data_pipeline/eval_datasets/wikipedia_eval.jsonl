{"id": "6899793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas%20Allanbrook", "title": "Douglas Allanbrook", "text": "Douglas Allanbrook (April 1, 1921 – January 29, 2003) was an American composer, concert pianist and harpsichordist. He was associated with a group of mid-twentieth century Boston composers who were students of Nadia Boulanger. His compositions are described by the Kennedy Center as \"smooth, showing astute sense, assertiveness, and originality.\"\n\n## Early life\n\nAllanbrook was born on April 1, 1921, in Melrose, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. He had one sister, Jean. He began taking piano lessons at the age of eight. Within two years he was playing Bach, Haydn, and Czerny. By thirteen, he started composing; his first serious piece was entitled On the Death of a Beautiful White Cat. While in high school, he was composing sonatas for violin and piano and writing sketches for a Symphony in G minor.\n\n## Education\n\nAfter high school, Allanbrook studied at Boston University for one year. In 1939 he was hired as a music teacher at the Mary Wheeler finishing school, a private girls' school, in Providence, where Gloria Vanderbilt was among his piano students. In 1941, the Rhode Island Symphony played his student orchestral work \"Music for a Tragedy.\"\n\nDuring the same year, Nadia Boulanger came to Providence to accept an honorary degree from Brown University. She heard some of Allanbrook's music and immediately took him under her wing. He began commuting regularly to Cambridge to study with her, and became part of her coterie of Boston composers, which included Harold Shapero, Irving Fine, Paul Desmarais, and Daniel Pinkham. She eventually persuaded him to quit his teaching job to study full-time, for free, with her.\n\nIn the fall of 1942, the Army drafted Allanbrook. Serving as an infantryman for three years, he fought his way up the Italian peninsula, in the process earning a Bronze Star and starting his lifelong love affair with Italy. His 1995 book, See Naples: A Memoir of Love, Peace, and War in Italy, recounts his wartime experiences with the 88th Division in the Italian Campaign, in which his division suffered a 75% casualty rate.\n\nWhen the war ended, he returned to Boston to enter Harvard University on the G.I. Bill. His major professor was composer Walter Piston, with whom he studied harmony, counterpoint, and orchestration. Among his fellow students were Peter Davison, who was to become a poet and publisher, and John Clinton Hunt, also to become a writer. Allanbrook composed prolifically, including his first three-movement piano sonata, and a cantata to T.S. Eliot's poem Ash Wednesday. He spent his summers at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, composing among distinguished artists also there.\n\nHe completed his B.A. degree in May 1948 and was awarded a Paine Traveling Fellowship from Harvard, which he used to spend the next two years (1948–1950) in Paris honing his composing and performing skills, once again studying under Nadia Boulanger. There, he formed close musical friendships with composers Ned Rorem, Noël Lee, Leo Preger and Georges Auric.\n\nIn the summer of 1950 on a Fulbright scholarship, he returned to Italy to study harpsichord at Conservatorio San Pietro a Majella under Ruggero Gerlin, a longtime associate of Wanda Landowska, Under Gerlin's tutelage, he learned to perform the partitas and the two books of the Well-Tempered Clavier of J. S. Bach, the Ordres of François Couperin, and various sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti. Allanbrook spent two extraordinarily creative years in Italy as composer and performer. His main work from this period is his first opera, Ethan Frome, a setting of Edith Wharton's novel of the same name with a libretto by John Clinton Hunt.\n\n## St. John's\n\nIn 1952 he returned to the U.S. to become a tutor at St. John's College in Annapolis in its Great Brooks Program. Although he taught part-time at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore from 1953 through 1956, he chose to stay at St. John's for the duration of his teaching career. Allanbrook was on the faculty at St. John's for 45 years, teaching music, math, philosophy, Greek, and French.\n\nIn 1982, he was awarded an American Academy of Arts and Letters music prize. He retired from the college in May 1986, he continued to teach and perform there until his death. For many years, he was a member of the board at the Yaddo artists colony near Saratoga Springs, NY. He died in Annapolis, Maryland on January 29, 2003, from a heart attack at the age of 81.\n\n## Catalog\n\nHis catalog contains 63 mature musical compositions, from his Te Deum (1942) to his String Quartet No. 6 (2002). He greatly admired Boulanger and Stravinsky, and his formative years of composing show influence from both artists. His main works include seven symphonies, two operas, Ethan Frome and Nightmare Abbey (based on the novel by Thomas Love Peacock), sacred and secular choral works, four string quartets, numerous chamber pieces, and innumerable piano and harpsichord works. His opera Ethan Frome was written in 1951 was based on the novel by Edith Wharton. \n\nHe performed the piano part himself in 1955 for Aaron Copland at the Harvard Club. However, the opera was shelved for fifty years until his son John Allanbrook directed in at the Eliot House. During his lifetime, his orchestral works were performed by orchestras across America and Europe, including the National Symphony Orchestra, Baltimore Symphony, Stuttgart Philharmonic, Munich Radio Orchestra. He had a warm and creative collaboration with the Annapolis Brass Quintet from 1975 until its disbandment in 1991. Other performers who gave premieres of his music under his supervision include harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick, violinist Robert Gerle, and the Kronos Quartet.\n\n## Personal life\n\nAllanbrook was married twice, with both marriages ending in divorce. As recounted in See Naples, his first marriage was in 1952 to Candida Curcio, a theater actress whom he met in Italy; they had a son, Timothy, an architect. Later in 1975, he married the Mozart scholar and future president of the American Musicological Society Wye Allanbrook née Jamison (March 15, 1943 – July 15, 2010); their son, John, is a musician who has conducted recordings of several major Allanbrook works for Mapleshade Records.\n\n## Publications\n\n* Douglas Allanbrook, See Naples: A Memoir.

{"id": "23572956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ti%E1%BA%BFn%20Trung", "title": "Nguyễn Tiến Trung", "text": "Nguyễn Tiến Trung (born 1983 in Hung Ha district, Thai Binh province) is a pro-democracy activist in Vietnam. As the founder and leader of the Assembly of Vietnamese Youth for Democracy Trung has been one of the outspoken political dissidents in Vietnam. He was arrested on July 7, 2009, by the public security of Vietnam for allegedly \"plotting to overthrow the government of Vietnam.\" The accusation was persistently rejected domestically and internationally by some Vietnam analysts such as Pham Hong Son and Carl Thayer.\n\n## Background\n\nAs a graduate of Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology in 2002, Trung went abroad to attend the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA) in France in 2002 and earned a Master's degree in Information Technology in 2007. It was during this interval that Trung took an interest in political activism, pushing for greater democracy in Vietnam.\n\n## Activism\n\nIn a bold move in February 2006, Trung petitioned the Communist Party of Vietnam Tenth Congress, followed by a letter titled “Suggestions from an ordinary student” to the Minister of Education Nguyen Minh Hien, seeking redress in the ideologically overbearing dose of politics in Vietnam's education system. There was no official response.\n\nOn May 8, 2006, Nguyễn Tiến Trung officially founded the Assembly of Vietnamese Youth for Democracy (Tập hợp Thanh niên Dân chủ, THTNDC in Vietnamese, variously translated as \"Movement of Democratic Youth\" and \"Democratic Youth of Vietnam\"), calling for students to take part in pushing for political reforms in Vietnam. The goals set forth include disseminating democratic principles, creating a forum for the exchange of political ideas, and organizing for political activism despite the still one-party state in Vietnam.\n\nTaking advantage of the 2006 APEC summit being hosted in Hanoi, THTNDC gathered signatures in mid-2006 petitioning the APEC leaders directly. Trung himself went to Canada seeking support from Canadian dignitaries to back the movement and the demand for democratic reforms. Furthermore, Trung met with President George W. Bush in the US and the members of the European Commission, enlisting their support.\n\nOn December 25, 2006, Nguyen Tien Trung formally submitted his application to the Vietnam Democratic Party (), headed by professor Hoang Minh Chinh and Nguyen Si Binh (alias: Nguyen Trong Nghia). Trung rose in this organization and was appointed deputy secretary for the party, heading up Youth Affairs.\n\nThe THTNDC in the meantime set up a new radio channel for Vietnamese youths in March 2007, broadcasting from Yahoo blog 360, twice weekly in 15–20 minute segments. In its debut broadcast, 7000 listeners tuned in.\n\nShortly after his return to Vietnam in 2007, Trung was called to present for military service in March 2008. According to his mother, he declined to take the Army's honor oath as he claimed it deviated from the revolutionary spirit set forth by Ho Chi Minh. Trung was dismissed from the military on 6 July 2009 but then arrested the very next day and charged with violating the 88th article of Criminal Code, allegedly for \"plotting to overthrow the government of Vietnam\".\n\nHis arrest followed the detention of two other dissidents, attorney Le Cong Dinh and Tran Anh Kim, a retired Army officer.\n\n## Vietnamese response\n\nAfter Trung's arrest, Vietnamese formed groups supporting him such as “Release Nguyen Tien Trung - say 1000s and 1000s of Vietnamese on FB\". However the response to this group was not strong. There were around 1000 people in the group, which had signed a letter appealing for his freedom.\n\n## International response\n\nOne day after Trung's arrest, Loretta Sanchez, member of the United States House of Representatives, officially protested the Vietnamese government's action in jailing the activists.\n\nPolitical analyst Carl Thayer from the University of New South Wales noted that charges of subversion are unsubstantiated while the real intent of the Communist authorities is to silence the dissidents.\n\nIn connection with Nguyen Tien Trung detention, Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based international non-government organization, has released an official condemnation of the arrest, asserting that while the rest of the world has its attention on protests in Iran and the riots in Xinjiang, the Vietnamese Communist government had jailed a number of pro-democracy activists who had spoken out against the state even though their efforts have been peaceful. This would set Vietnam back 10 years in terms of the democratizing process. This was followed by reports that Nguyen Tien Trung was denied access to legal counsel. While in detention Trung is under coercive physical and psychological measures to \"confess\". The communiqué issued by Reporters Without Borders called on the international community to pressure the Vietnamese government to live up to its signatory status in respecting human rights.\n\nOn July 14, The European Union (EU) represented by The EU Troika through the ambassadors of Sweden, Spain and The European Commission formally expressed their “grave concern” over the recent arrests of Nguyen Tien Trung and Tran Anh Kim.\n\nOther analysts asserted that the arrests of activists like Nguyen Tien Trung are part of Vietnam's synchronizing its policy with China's current repressive stance in silencing all protest.\n\nOn August 2 Nguyen Tien Trung's supporters protested publicly at the Trocadéro, Paris in an attempt to draw more attention toward his detention. Appearing in the campaign, Professor Philippe Echard, a former head of the International Relations Department of INSA, told the BBC that he, as an educator supervising international relations issues, was extremely concerned over the arrest of Nguyen Tien Trung by the Vietnamese communist government. He called for the immediate and unconditional release of Trung.\n\n## Vietnam's Government-published confessing video\n\nIn a response to the confession videotape of Nguyen Tien Trung subsequently broadcast on Vietnam's national television following his arrest, Nguyen Hoang Lan, one of members of the Democratic Party of Vietnam and the Assembly of Vietnamese Youth for Democracy, pronounced that Trung's confession, along with those of the other dissidents under detention was made under duress. The Vietnamese authorities aired the tape to \"prove\" Trung's complicity and counter international criticisms of his arrest.\n\nAccording to a formal announcement of the Assembly of Vietnamese Youth for Democracy toward the confession tape of Nguyen Tien Trung and the other pro-democracy activists, the Assembly proclaimed the action of filming the defendant, while under investigation, appeared to be an abuse formally forbidden by law. The Assembly steadfastly articulated that no one should seem to be convicted for their crimes before an official verdict has been handed down. The Assembly called on Vietnam's government to respect the democratic processes in the legal proceedings against all of the defendants. The members of the Assembly of Vietnamese Youth for Democracy have been supporting Nguyen Tien Trung and others arrested for peaceful activism; so far their detentions have not resulted in charges or trial. The Assembly has formally made another appeal to the government for the immediate and unconditional release of the arrested activists, on the grounds of respect for Vietnam's constitution and international conventions.\n\nHe was released in April, 2014 to be returned to his home under local supervision and serve the remaining three years under house arrest.\n\n## See also\n\n* Assembly of Vietnamese Youth for Democracy\n\n* Human rights in Vietnam\n\n## External links\n\n* Vietnam's new dissidents thrive via Internet\n\n* Two men arrested for anti-state activities\n\n* Vietnam: More dissidents arrested\n\n* Carlyle A.

The position was consolidated in the Taihō Code of 701. The Asuka Kiyomihara Code of 689 marks the initial appearance of the Udaijin in the context of a central administrative body called the Daijō-kan (Council of State). This early Daijō-kan was composed of the three ministers—the Daijō-daijin (Chancellor), the Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) and the Udaijin. The Udaijin was the Junior Minister of State, overseeing all branches of the Daijō-kan. He would be the deputy of the Sadaijin.\n\nFrom the Kamakura period (1185–1333), when the warrior class came to power in Japan, this imperial court position became an honorary position with no real authority. Oda Nobunaga, who was a powerful daimyo in the Azuchi-Momoyama period, was a daimyo who held this imperial court position. This was the first time since Minamoto no Sanetomo in 1218 that a member of the warrior class had been appointed Udaijin. Previously, the only warrior class members appointed to higher positions than Udaijin were Taira no Kiyomori and Ashikaga Yoshimitsu as Daijō-daijin, and Ashikaga Yoshinori and Ashikaga Yoshimasa as Sadaijin. The warrior class was able to use the high imperial court positions of , , and , which had originally belonged to the nobility, as a means of establishing their own authority.\n\n## See also\n\n* Daijō-kan\n\n* Kugyō\n\n* Sesshō and Kampaku\n\n* List of Daijō-daijin\n\n* Kōkyū\n\n* Kuge\n\n* Imperial Household Agency\n\n## References\n\n* Asai, T.

{"id": "6902699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennies%20from%20Heaven%20%281981%20film%29", "title": "Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)", "text": "Pennies from Heaven is a 1981 American musical romantic drama film directed by Herbert Ross, based on the 1978 BBC television drama. Dennis Potter adapted his screenplay from the BBC series for American audiences, changing its setting from London and the Forest of Dean to Depression-era Chicago and rural Illinois.\n\nThe film stars Steve Martin, Bernadette Peters, Christopher Walken and Jessica Harper. Choreographed by Danny Daniels, the film includes musical numbers consisting of actors lip-syncing and dancing to popular songs of the 1920s–30s, such as \"Let's Misbehave\", \"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries\", \"Let's Face the Music and Dance\" and the title song.\n\nWhile positively received by critics, it was a box office bomb, grossing just a fraction of its budget. Potter received a nomination for the 1981 Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, but lost to On Golden Pond.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1934, Chicago sheet-music salesman Arthur Parker is going through hard times. His business is failing, and his wife Joan refuses to give him the money she inherited from her father to start his own business.\n\nArthur's dream is to live in a world that is like the songs he tries to sell. He is refused a bank loan, although he fantasizes that he gets it. In his travels, Arthur meets schoolteacher Eileen and falls in love with her instantly. They embark on a short affair, but Arthur leaves her and returns to Joan, who is desperate to keep him and agrees to give him the money he wanted. Arthur denies having an affair, though Joan is sure he is lying.\n\nEileen gets pregnant by Arthur and is fired. With nowhere to go, she takes up with stylish pimp Tom. Eileen is attracted to Tom's \"badness\", and he arranges for her to have an abortion.\n\nWhen Arthur meets Eileen again, she is now a prostitute calling herself \"Lulu\". They resume their romance, and Eileen leaves Tom and her sordid life. Impulsively, Arthur convinces her to run away with him. Having failed to sell his business, Arthur and Eileen break into the store one night and trash it, smashing its phonograph records (except for \"Pennies from Heaven\"). To supplement their income, Eileen keeps prostituting in spite of Arthur's objections.\n\nA blind girl whom Arthur knew superficially is raped and murdered by an accordion-playing hobo to whom Arthur had given a ride earlier in the film. The police suspect Arthur, and Joan tells them that he has sordid sexual proclivities to get back at him for cheating on her. The police find Arthur trying to leave town with Eileen, and arrest him for murder; he is soon convicted and sentenced to death. At the gallows, he recites the lyrics from the song \"Pennies from Heaven\". In one final fantasy, Arthur and Eileen are reunited, with Arthur saying, \"We couldn't have gone through all that without a happy ending. Songs ain't like that, are they?\"\n\n## Cast\n\n* Steve Martin as Arthur Parker\n\n* Bernadette Peters as Eileen (\"Lulu\")\n\n* Jessica Harper as Joan Parker\n\n* Vernel Bagneris as Accordion man\n\n* John McMartin as Mr. Warner\n\n* John Karlen as Detective\n\n* Jay Garner as Banker\n\n* Robert Fitch as Al\n\n* Tommy Rall as Ed \n\n* Eliska Krupka as blind girl\n\n* Christopher Walken as Tom\n\n* Raleigh Bond as Mr. Barrett\n\n* George P.

McCarthy as The Bartender\n\n* Will Hare as Father Everson\n\n## Production\n\nPennies from Heaven was Martin's first dramatic role in a film. He had watched the original miniseries and considered it \"the greatest thing [he'd] ever seen.\" He trained for eight months learning to tap dance, while Christopher Walken, who had trained as a dancer as a young man, was able to use his dancing skills in the film.\n\nAccording to a 1990 article in The Times, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Potter rewrite the script 13 times and required him to buy back his copyright from the BBC, for which he paid the BBC \"something over $100,000\". In addition, MGM prohibited broadcast of the BBC's original production for 10 years. Around 1989, at the prompting of Alan Yentob, the controller of BBC2, producer Kenith Trodd was able to buy back the rights from MGM for \"a very inconsiderable sum.\" In February 1990, the BBC rebroadcast the original Pennies from Heaven serial for the first time since 1978.\n\nIn the same Times article, Trodd stated that Bob Hoskins and Cheryl Campbell, the stars of the original series, \"were terribly upset that they weren't considered for the film. I think they still blame Dennis and me in some way, but there was no way to argue the point with MGM.\"\n\nThe style of the movie balances the drab despair of the Depression era and the characters' sad lives with brightly colored dream-fantasy lavish musical sequences. The characters break into song and dance to express their emotions. For example, Eileen turns into a silver-gowned torch singer in her school-room, with her students lip-synching and dancing (\"Love Is Good for Anything That Ails You\"). Tom seduces Eileen with a tap dance/striptease routine on top of a bar (\"Let's Misbehave\"). Arthur and Eileen go to a film (Follow the Fleet) and wind up dancing in formal wear, first with, then in, a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical number from the film, \"Let's Face the Music and Dance\". All the songs are lip-synched, except Martin singing/speaking the title song at the end, but Arthur, Tom, and Eileen dance.\n\nFour paintings are recreated as tableaux vivants in the film: Hudson Bay Fur Company and 20 Cent Movie by Reginald Marsh, and New York Movie and Nighthawks by Edward Hopper. Three of the four were painted after 1934, when the movie takes place, and all depict scenes in New York City rather than the Chicago setting of the movie.\n\n## Box office\n\nThe film was a commercial failure, grossing slightly more than $9 million at the box office against a budget of $22 million.\n\nWhen asked in Rolling Stone about the film's box office failure, Martin said: \"I'm disappointed that it didn't open as a blockbuster and I don't know what's to blame, other than it's me and not a comedy. I must say that the people who get the movie, in general, have been wise and intelligent; the people who don't get it are ignorant scum.\"\n\nDavid Begelman, head of MGM, called it \"the most daring film we made. It took all these different textures and molded them... I didn't make that picture because I enjoy walking a tightrope. I made that picture because with every honest conviction you can bring to bear, I believed that film could become a film of such incredible celebrity it would enjoy very wide success. I was wrong. I was completely wrong.\"\n\nIt was Martin's second starring role in a film, following 1979's comedy hit The Jerk, and fans were confused to see Martin in a serious role. \"You just can't do a movie like Pennies from Heaven after you have done The Jerk,\" Martin said in a BBC interview.\n\n\"Everything I had done until that time had been wildly successful,\" he recalled in 1987, \"so that the commercial failure of the film caught me by surprise. I still think artistically it's a very good film. I've rarely seen a role that showed that kind of vulnerability in a man. It's a special film to me, and if I had to find fault, it would be that I think some of the music could have included more popular songs of the period.\"\n\n## Critical response\n\n \n\nThe film was given a rapturous review by Pauline Kael in The New Yorker, writing \"Pennies from Heaven is the most emotional movie musical I've ever seen. It's a stylized mythology of the Depression which uses the popular songs of the period as expressions of people's deepest longings—for sex, for romance, for money, for a high good time...there was never a second when I wasn't fascinated by what was happening on the screen.\" Kael further noted that \"The dance numbers are funny, amazing, and beautiful all at once; several of them are just about perfection.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it \"a rejuvenating, landmark achievement in the evolution of Hollywood musicals, and certainly the finest American movie of 1981. A brilliantly enhanced distillation of a 1978 British television play, Pennies blends the astringent with the poignant and the fanciful. It appears as a belated Hollywood counterpart to Brecht and Weill's 'Three Penny Opera.'\"\n\nOther contemporary reviews were less positive. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and called it \"all flash and style and no heart.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times reported that he watched the film \"with what might best be described as baffled interest.\" He wrote that \"All of the musical numbers are good, and a couple are great...The movie, though, is not easy to respond to. It's chilly without being provocative in any intellectual way.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote \"'Pennies From Heaven' is one of the most hopelessly esoteric big-budget Hollywood pictures ever made, a lugubrious, neo-Brechtian musical exercise of notable pretension and virtually no artistic payoff...In short, it's 'Penny Gate.'\" Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader wrote that \"ironic, alienating musicals have been tried before, but never with such lofty contempt for the form. [The film] drips with a sense of anger and betrayal that seems wildly out of scale to its cause - the discovery (less than original) that musicals don't reproduce social reality.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that \"Martin ruins what could have been one of the year's freshest and most innovative films. With Martin hamming it up, 'Pennies From Heaven' is full of socko moments, but the entire film doesn't hold together.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"it is like no other period musical. It is so far out, so unexpected, that it might well be described as experimental...As such, it's likely to elicit deeply divided reactions: Audiences will either love it or hate it.\"\n\nPeters won the Golden Globe as Best Motion Picture Actress in a Comedy or Musical for her role as Eileen Everson, a schoolteacher turned prostitute. A review of the DVD reissue asserted, \"Peters brought a cocky attitude and a sexy exuberance to the musical numbers.\"\n\nFred Astaire, who was powerless to prevent the reuse of the footage from his film Follow the Fleet, detested Pennies from Heaven: \"I have never spent two more miserable hours in my life. Every scene was cheap and vulgar. They don't realize that the '30s were a very innocent age, and that [the film] should have been set in the '80s – it was just froth; it makes you cry it's so distasteful.\"\n\nThe film was nominated by the American Film Institute for its 2006 list of Greatest Movie Musicals.\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\nAcademy Awards\n\n* Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium – Dennis Potter (nominated)\n\n* Best Costume Design – Bob Mackie (nominated)\n\n* Best Sound - Michael J.

{"id": "6906486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%20for%20Yesterday", "title": "Time for Yesterday", "text": "Time For Yesterday is a science fiction novel by American writer A. C. Crispin set in the fictional Star Trek Universe. It is a sequel to Crispin's earlier novel, Yesterday's Son, and describes a second encounter between the crew of the USS Enterprise and Spock's son, Zar.\n\nThe two books followed the original series episode \"All Our Yesterdays\", and Time For Yesterday is subtitled The Yesterday Saga, Book 2.\n\n## Plot summary\n\nThe Guardian of Forever has malfunctioned and is emitting waves of accelerated time that are causing premature star deaths throughout the galaxy. After Spock recalls that his son Zar was once able to communicate telepathically with the Guardian, the Enterprise is placed under the temporary command of Admiral Kirk and detailed to transport a powerful telepath to the Guardian. The telepath manages to partially restore the Guardian's time travel functions but collapses in a comatose state. Using the Guardian, Kirk, Spock, and Dr. McCoy travel into the past of the planet Sarpeidon to find Zar, hoping that his powerful telepathy combined with Vulcan shield training will allow him to successfully restore the Guardian to its normal state.\n\nThey find Zar in charge of a small, technologically advanced settlement that is about to engage in a battle with an alliance of less advanced but more numerous enemy clans. His death in the coming battle has been foretold by the priestess Wynn, the daughter of one of the enemy clan chiefs, who declares that the alliance will be denied victory only if \"he who is halt walks healed\" and \"he who is death-struck in battle rises whole.\" \"He who is halt\" clearly refers to Zar, who walks with a painful limp because of a leg injury he suffered many years before. In order to increase his city's odds of survival, Zar has Wynn kidnapped and betrothed, forcing her father to change sides. The Enterprise men manage to convince him to come back with them and deal with the Guardian, although he insists that he will return afterward to fight in the battle despite the prophecy.\n\nZar successfully melds with the Guardian and returns its consciousness to its physical structure, along with a burst of energy that turns out to be several beings of pure energy. The Guardian explains that it abandoned its duties to search for its Creators, who long ago evolved into beings of pure energy and entered another dimension. Its fundamental programming required it to answer their summons and bring them home, and the resource drain connected to the search resulted in its apparent malfunction. The Creators are immensely old and senile, and wish to find their home system to die there; but they have forgotten where it is. The Creators assume the form of people drawn from the memories of the Enterprise men in order to converse with them. While some of the beings act in a benevolent manner, a few seem capricious and cruel, and even completely deranged. Eventually, Kirk and the others manage to convince them that their search would endanger intelligent life throughout the galaxy, and they re-enter another dimension via the Guardian. The Guardian, with the assistance of Zar and Spock, is able to force the remaining, less rational Creators to comply.\n\nMcCoy convinces Zar to undergo treatment and physical therapy aboard the Enterprise, healing his limp and giving him a greater chance of survival in the coming battle. Zar achieves peak physical condition and is able to walk normally again, fulfilling the first half of Wynn's prophecy. When he returns to Sarpeidon's past, Spock follows him, intending to help save him in the battle. Spock is unable to prevent the death-blow from landing, although he deflects it slightly, and Zar is unconscious but still alive. In order to fulfill the second half of the prophecy, Spock puts on Zar's armor and shows himself to the army, leading them to believe their leader has risen whole from being \"death-struck\". \nUpon seeing this, most of the remaining clans surrender and Zar's army wins the battle. After ensuring that Zar will survive the blow and leaving him to Wynn's care, Spock returns to the present.\n\n## Characters\n\n* Mr. Spock\n\n* Zar\n\n* Captain James T. Kirk\n\n* Dr. Leonard McCoy\n\n* Wynn\n\n* Guardian of Forever\n\n## Audio version\n\nThe book is available in an audiobook adaptation read by James Doohan and Leonard Nimoy.\n\n## Release details\n\n* 1988, USA, Pocket Books , April 1988, Softcover\n\n## Background\n\nCrispin said that of the four Star Trek novels she wrote, Time for Yesterday was the one of which she was most proud, \"because it was a prequel to Wrath of Khan, my favorite Trek film. Also, it was fun to write a love story for Zar.\"\n\n## Reception\n\nEllen Cheeseman-Meyer of Tor.com described the \"Yesterday Saga\" as \"both precious and hilarious.\"\n\n## External links\n\n* Time For Yesterday at Memory Alpha, the Star Trek wiki\n\n1988 American novels\nNovels based on Star Trek: The Original Series\nNovels by Ann C.

She was a niece of Michael VIII Palaiologos.\n\nShe is referred to as the most powerful empress of Bulgaria. She ruled as regent from 1271 to 1279 on behalf of her minor son, Michael Asen II, who was made co-regent of her first spouse, and remained co-regent during the reign of her second spouse.\n\n## Family\n\nMaria was the second daughter of John Kantakouzenos and Irene Komnene Palaiologina, sister of Michael VIII Palaiologos.\n\nAccording to George Pachymeres, Maria was unusually perfidious and sly and she had a strong influence over the people and the clergy. He would have it that Maria supported her uncle's military coup d'etat and she prompted him to blind the legitimate emperor John IV Laskaris, who was brother of Bulgarian empress Irene, second wife of tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria.\n\n## Wife of Constantine Tikh\n\nThe deposition and blinding of the minor Nicaean emperor John IV Laskaris by Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261 pitted Constantine Tikh, as the brother-in-law of the deposed emperor, against Michael VIII.\n\nAfter the death of tsarina Irene Laskarina in 1268 Constantine Tikh sought a reconciliation with Michael VIII by proposing to marry a Byzantine princess related to Palaiologos, and Michael VIII offered his niece Maria. Maria had one previous marriage, to Alexios Philes, and Constantine Tikh had two. As a condition for the marriage alliance, the Black Sea ports of Mesembria and Anchialos were to be handed over as her dowry.\n\nMaria and Constantine Tikh married in 1269. However, quarrels over the surrender of Maria's promised dowry soured the improved relationship. Maria realized that the behaviour of her uncle would undermine her position in the Bulgarian court, so she openly put up her husband to attack Michael VIII. The Bulgarian government entered into an alliance with King Charles I of Sicily who was planning a campaign against Michael VIII with the object of restoring the Latin Empire. Michael VIII responded by marrying his illegitimate daughter Euphrosyne Palaiologina to Nogai Khan of the Golden Horde, who, as a Byzantine ally, pillaged Bulgaria in 1274.\n\n## Regent\n\nIn the last years of his reign, Constantine Tikh was partly paralyzed from a fall off his horse, and suffered from unspecified ailments. The government was firmly in the hands of Maria Kantakouzene, who crowned their son Michael Asen II co-emperor soon after his birth, in about 1272. As such, she acted in his behalf as regent. Maria presided over relations with the Byzantine Empire in the 1270s, and engineered first the submission and then the murder (by poison) of the despotēs Yakov Svetoslav of Vidin, a strong pretender for the Bulgarian crown, in 1275. The tsarina invited Yakov Svetoslav to Tarnovo, promising to adopt him and to allow him to participate in the governing of the country. In 1275 Yakov Svetoslav arrived at Tarnovo and he indeed proclaimed as the second son of Maria in an official ceremony, officiated by patriarch Ignatiy of Bulgaria. Yakov died soon after his return to Vidin. George Pachymeres accused Maria for his death.\n\nDue to the expensive and unsuccessful wars, repeated Mongol raids, and economic instability, Maria's government was faced with a revolt in 1277; the Uprising of Ivaylo. What is clear is that a swineherd or swine-owner named Ivaylo became a leader of the discontented and attracted many (presumably mostly lower-class) followers, asserting his control over a significant area. Tsar Constantine set out against Ivaylo with his guard, but was decisively defeated and slain in his chariot in 1277. Ivaylo himself is credited with the killing.\n\nAlthough he was able to extend his authority across much of the country, he also met with resistance, and the capital Tarnovo remained under the control of the legitimate emperor Michael Asen II and his mother Maria Kantakouzene.\n\n## Wife of Ivaylo\n\nIvaylo's successes troubled the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, who married his eldest daughter Irene to Ivan Asen III, a descendant of Bulgaria's ruling dynasty living at the Byzantine court, and dispatched troops to place him on the throne. This caused an alliance between Ivaylo and Maria Kantakouzena, and the widowed empress married Ivaylo, who was recognized as Bulgarian emperor in 1278, without deposing or disinheriting the minor Michael Asen II.\n\nMaria's decision was defined by Byzantines as \"indecent\" and \"impure\", because she, a descendant of the noble Palaiologos and Kantakouzenos families, had married a swineherd, who had moreover killed her husband. In this connection Michael VIII declared openly that Maria \"had brought disgrace on her family\" and she \"had destroyed her kingdom\".\n\nThe marriage of Ivaylo and Maria was allegedly unhappy. Ivaylo led a successful defense of the Balkan passes against the Byzantine campaigns to establish Ivan Asen III on the Bulgarian throne. Ivaylo had also met with success against casual Mongol raids, but in 1279 a major Mongol army blockaded him in the fortress of Dorostolon (Silistra) on the Danube for three months. A rumor of Ivaylo's death caused panic in Tarnovo, where the nobility surrendered to a new Byzantine army and accepted Ivan Asen III as emperor. Ivan Asen III was enthroned, while Michael Asen II and Maria Kantakouzena, who was pregnant by Ivaylo, were sent into exile to Constantinople.\n\nMaria Kantakouzene and Ivaylo had a daughter, whose name is unknown.\n\n## Sources\n\n* Vasil Zlatarski, \"История на българската държава през средните векове.

Since its inception, Kids Saving the Rainforest has planted or is in the process of planting nearly 100,000 trees and rescued and rehabilitated 3,000 wild animals, two-thirds of which have been released back into the wild.\n\nKSTR's mission is: \"to protect the diverse wildlife of Costa Rica’s Pacific Coast by rehabilitating wildlife, conducting original scientific research, training volunteers, and promoting conservation.\"\n\n## History\n\nKids Saving the Rainforest was founded in February 1999 by two nine-year old girls, Janine Licare and Aislin Livingstone, who were living in the jungle of Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica. The girls made paper-mache bottles and painted rocks and sold them by the side of the road to raise money for saplings that would be planted in the nearby forest.\n\nSince then, KSTR has become a fully functional environmental organization with a board of directors. Licare's mother, Jennifer Rice is president. The staff includes a number of full-time people plus volunteers.\n\nKSTR is located outside Manual Antonio, Costa Rica, but has projects in 18 countries.\n\n## Rescue, rehabilitate and release\n\nKSTR rescues and rehabs animals that are brought to their facility. In addition, the ones that can not be released back into the wild are given sanctuary for life on the property. The goal is to release as many animals as possible. With an average of 200 rescues a year, over 75 species have been rescued at their center. This includes, among others, two- and three-toed sloths, squirrel monkeys, kinkajous, coatis, marmosets, tamarins, orange-chinned parakeets.\n\n## Wildlife bridges\n\nKSTR started a Wildlife Bridge Program in 2000, originally to protect the endangered titi monkeys (squirrel monkey). They have since put up 130 bridges and 14 different animal species have been using them. Meanwhile, the titi monkey population has doubled. Whenever an arboreal animal is electrocuted by live wires, hit by a car, or attacked by dogs, KSTR reviews the necessity of a bridge and places it for them to cross high off the ground.\n\n## Reforestation\n\nSince its inception, KSTR has planted over 7,000 trees, is in the process of planting another 80,000 on donated property elsewhere in Costa Rica, and reforests in other countries as well.\n\n## Volunteers\n\nIn order to run its facility and care for the animals, KSTR relies on volunteers who come in from around the world to help with all aspects of its programs. The volunteers clean, repair, and build cages, work on trails, prepare food for the animals, observe behavior, and more. Many volunteers are housed where they work at KSTR, but some opt for a day of volunteer work offered by area tour companies.\n\n## Education\n\nA key element of KSTR is education about biodiversity conservation. Visitors who take the tours of the facility are given an educational talk about the rainforest and its inhabitants.\n\n## Funding\n\nKSTR operates entirely on donations.\n\n## References\n\nAnimal rescue groups\nEnvironmental organizations based in Costa Rica"}

The CL-475 has a three-bladed main rotor and a two-bladed tail rotor. Only one was built.\n\n## Design and development\n\nIn 1958, Irv Culver presented an idea for how to rigidly attach the rotor blades of a helicopter to the hub, to the Lockheed management. In 1920, Juan de la Cierva had tried the same concept, but had trouble controlling the rotor, because of excessive gyroscopic moments. Culver's research led him to believe that there was a way to control the excessive pitch and roll moments by incorporating a feedback system into the rotor. Culver's solution to high control moments was a device known as the \"compliance factor\". It kept the blades forward less than a degree, which would apply a corrective feathering input to the opposite blade. This essentially was the moment feedback system. Before presenting his ideas, he had built a radio-controlled model that demonstrated the feasibility of the concept. Lockheed gave him use of part of a flight test hangar, a flight test engineer and two mechanics.\n\nThe CL-475 is a two-seat helicopter with a fabric-covered steel and aluminum structure. The glazed cockpit provides side-by-side seating for two occupants. The landing gear is designed in a tricycle configuration, with two large wheels mounted alongside the bottom of the fuselage, and a nosewheel mounted underneath the cockpit. The helicopter is powered by a 140 hp (104 kW), four-cylinder, air-cooled Lycoming O-360-A1A piston engine. Designed to test a rigid-rotor concept, it originally utilized a two-bladed wooden rotor.\n\nAfter completion at Burbank, the CL-475 was taken to Rosamond Lake on Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert for testing. It was first flown on 2 November 1959, but the pilot reported severe vibrations. For six months, Lockheed experimented with three and four-bladed wooden rotors, but stability was finally achieved by using metal blades in a three-blade configuration and the addition of a gyroscopic control ring connected directly to the swashplate. In the mid-1960s, the helicopter was test flown by a number of government and military agencies, and also the military. The stability offered by the rigid rotor control system made the helicopter easy to fly, and the lessons learned from the CL-475 rigid rotor were later used to develop the Lockheed XH-51 and AH-56 Cheyenne.\n\nIn 1975, Lockheed donated the CL-475 to the National Air and Space Museum. The helicopter was loaned to the United States Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker, Alabama, but was in the museum's storage as of 2009.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* \n\n* Francillon, René J.

{"id": "6913139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati%20L-twin%20engine", "title": "Ducati L-twin engine", "text": "The L-twin is a naturally aspirated two-cylinder petrol engine by Ducati. It uses a 90-degree layout and 270-degree firing order and is mounted with one cylinder nearly horizontal.\n\nThe next new Ducati engine to appear after the Ducati Apollo was the 90° V-twin, initial Grand Prix racing versions being 500 cc, and the production bikes were 750 cc. There was also the Ducati 750 Imola Desmo that won at Imola in 1972. These engines had bevel gear shaft drive to the overhead camshaft, and were produced in round, square, and Mille crankcases. In the 1980s, these gave way to the belt drive camshaft engines that have continued to this day, in air-cooled and liquid-cooled form. The Mille used a plain bearing crank, like the belt models.\n\n## V-twin or L-twin\n\nA two-cylinder engine with its cylinders aligned in two banks radiating out from the crankshaft, forming a V angle, is called a V-twin. The Ducati V-twin has the V tilted forward, so the front cylinder is nearly parallel to the ground, hence the term L-twin.\n\n## Two-valve engines\n\nDucati engineer, Fabio Taglioni, once said that when they started building the plain bearing crank, belt-driven camshaft engines, instead of the old ball bearing crank, bevel geared shaft drive camshaft engines, he had gone from making complex engines to making simple ones.\n\n## Multivalve models\n\nFrom 1987 there have also been Ducati multivalve motorcycles.\n\n## History\n\nOn March 20, 1970, Fabio Taglioni made the first sketches for the layout of a new Ducati V-twin. By April, his drawings were completed, and by July, there was a running motor. By August 1970, there was a complete prototype motorcycle. Taglioni engaged Leopoldo Tartarini, the founder of Italjet, to refine the styling aspects of the new Ducati.\n\nIn October 1970, the decision was made by Ducati to re-enter the motorcycle competition. Director Arnaldo Milvio and General Manager Fredmano Spairani, were enthusiastic about racing, and had encouraged Fabio Taglioni to develop the 750 V-twin. In 1971 five 500 cc V-twins were built to compete in the Italian championship and Grand Prix events. Ducati felt that this would demonstrate the bike before a large audience and gain publicity. If they won, that was a bonus.\n\nEven before this, in late 1970, and despite Taglioni's opposition to the idea, Spairani wanted the frame for Ducati's racer to be built by Colin Seeley, a well-known British specialist frame builder of the time. Seeley was asked to develop a racing frame similar to those he had built for G50 Matchless engines. They sent some prototype crankcases for Seeley to work from. Ducati's new Seely frame was ready in February 1971.\n\nMeanwhile, in less than six months, Fabio Taglioni and his team had designed and built their own complete bike (the industry norm for a concept to production is three years). While the 750 and 500 racers were very similar, the 500 had a much shorter 58 mm stroke with its 74 mm bore. It had 10.5:1 compression and initially produced at 11,000 rpm. (Same bore and stroke as the later 500 Pantah) All Ducati's 500 cc GP engines used desmodromic two valve heads with an 80-degree included valve angle. They used remote float bowl Dell'Orto 40 mm carburettors, and had a six speed gearbox with a dry, multiplate clutch. Ignition was electronic, provided by nearby Ducati Elettrotecnica, but was initially unreliable. Dual spark plugs were used, and the final ignition system used four coils, two on each side of the frame.\n\nIn the beginning, Taglioni's Ducati chassis was used. It had a single Lockheed front disc brake and a twin leading shoe Fontana rear drum brake. Dry weight was 135 kg, and it had 18in rims front and rear with 3.00 and 3.25 tyres. Wheelbase was 1430 mm. In June 1971, Phil Read tested the 500 cc bike with the Seeley frame, and pronounced it the better of the two. The frame was then fitted to Spaggiari's bike as well. It was raced in 1972 by Bruno Spaggiari, Ermanno Guliano, and Phil Read.\n\nAlso, in June 1971, the first Ducati 750 GT models came out of the factory, distinguished by silver frames, metal-flake paint, fibreglass fuel tanks, 30 mm Amal carburettors, and twin leading shoe rear brakes. Taglioni experimented with four valve heads at this time, but failed to produce better power figures than his two valve heads, so the two valve racers continued. He continued to experiment with four valve heads right up to 1973.\n\nIn 1971 race results were spoilt by a run of gearbox and ignition problems. Phil Read's second to Agostini in the San Remo Grand Prix, and a fourth, also by Read, at Monza in the Grand Prix delle Nazione were the highlights of the season. A Seeley frame 750 cc had been tested by Mike Hailwood at Silverstone in August 1971 with a view to competing in Formula 750. Hailwood decided against it, saying he didn't think the handling was good enough. Taglioni had already produced a new frame, for the production bike, incorporating some of the Seeley features. He later said he felt the Seeley frame had been too light for the V-twins. They used the production frame for the 1972 Imola bikes.\n\nThe 200 Mile formula was first ro run in Italy in 1972, at Imola. Ducati prepared eight 750 cc bikes for the event. Paul Smart, Bruno Spaggiari, Ermanno Giuliano, and Alan Dunscombe were secured as riders. By now, the racing fever had set in, and the factory wanted to win. The bikes had the new factory frames and 750 engines, and were once more prepared in a very short time. Wherever possible, the bike was lightened, and new 40 mm Dell'Orto carburetors with accelerator pumps were used. These engines delivered at 8,500 rpm. In that Imola 200 held in April, Smart and Spaggiari came in first and second. The effect on Ducati sales was remarkable. Suddenly, a lot more people the world over knew about Ducati.\n\nThe current production 750GT now had a black frame, a new seat, and a red or black paint-job.\n\nRacing success did not last long once Agostini's bike was improved. In May 1972, Bruno Spaggiari finished third in the Italian Grand Prix at Imola, with Paul Smart in fourth, reversing their finishing order in the 200 of a month before. Now the twin could not match Agostini on the MV triple.\n\nTaglioni turned to fuel injection. Direct injection was tried on the 500 grand prix bike at a test session at Modena in March 1972. It was outlawed by the FIM as a form of supercharging soon after. By 1972 the racing bikes had Lockheed twin front discs with a single Lockheed rear disc. Unique leading axle Marzocchi front forks were used. In 1972 a three-cylinder 350 cc 12 valve dohc engine with a seven speed gearbox, was developed, based on a British Ricarclo engine. Fortunately for V-twin fans, it was not competitive.\n\nThe 1972 Ducati 750 Sport was released, initially using the 750GT frame with the wider seat section and upper rear shocks in line with the frame, but this was soon changed to a frame with a slimmer rear and the upper rear shock mounts outside the frame. While many components were still shared between the Sport and GT, the main differences were narrower fuel tank, bum-stop rear seat cowl, clip-on handlebars, and rearset foot controls, all giving the Sport its distinct racer persona. The Sport also had blacked out crankcase, 32 mm Dell'Orto carburettors, single seat and sports fuel tank. As with the 750 GT, Tartarini was the styling consultant. At the same time the single-cylinder street racer models were given a restyle, and a matching paint job to the 750 Sport\n\nThe last iteration of the 500 racer appeared during 1973, with belt driven double overhead camshafts, and a radial finned front cylinder. The camshaft belts were on the opposite side to the bevel gear shaft drives on earlier engines. The engine had been developed for Taglioni outside Ducati by Armaroli, and featured the reversed head layout found in the later Paso where the inlet ports face each other. It produced at 12,000 rpm, not a big increase. MV continued to win. In 1971 and 1972, the 500s, and later the 750s, were raced and displayed throughout the western world as part of a major publicity exercise to promote the Ducati name.\n\nIn 1973 there was a disastrous change of management personnel. The new boss was De Eccher. All racing projects, including the 500 four, 350 triple, and the 500 GP V-twin, were scrapped. Production was to end for the round case 750 models and all the single-cylinder models. Despite Ducati's withdrawal from racing, many privateers, tuners, and independent racing teams continued to campaign and develop their motorcycles.\n\nIn 1973 the production Ducati 750 SuperSport model was unveiled, with an Imola kit for the intending racers. The bike was distinguished by its slim green frame, gaping bell mouths on 40 mm Dell'Ortos, half fairing, fibreglass sports fuel tank with clear fuel-level strip down the side, and single seat.\n\nBy now the GT and Sport had steel fuel tanks. The GT had shorter rear shocks to lower seat height for the American market, but it meant the bike would ground out more easily when cornering. The Amals on the GT were replaced by 30 mm Dell'Ortos with accelerator pumps. This reduced fuel economy a little.\n\nIn 1973 the Barcelona 24-hour race was won by Canellas and Grau on a round case Ducati 750 SS converted into an 860 by the use of the Ducati 450 single-cylinder engine's sleeves and pistons. In 1974, the 860 GT went into production. The crankcases had been redesigned by Giugiaro, along with the rest of the bike, with a squared off look, quite unlike the flowing lines of the 750. The new boss De Eccher saw Ducati's future in US exports, and had engaged Giorgetto Giugiaro to do the external design work on the new 860 instead of Tartarini. Taglioni was made to redesign the outer engine cases to match Giugiaro's design. (The new 350 and 500 GTL sport vertical twins were also released, also externally designed by Giugiaro. The motors were not built by Taglioni. He had refused to be involved with them.)\n\nDucati sales fell. The 860 GTS did not sell well, and the vertical twins were hardly selling at all. De Eccher was out, and Taglioni was back in favour, and so, by association, was Tartarini. A hasty re-design of the fuel tank and seat was undertaken to create the 900GTS - a model destined to help the company regain some ground. At the same time plans were put in place to create two new models the Darmah and the Pantah.\n\nIn 1974, Australian importer Ron Angel entered a \"Ducati 860 SS\" in the Unlimited Production event at the Easter motorbike races at Bathurst, on the mountain. This was the biggest annual motorcycle event in Australia at the time. The bike was ridden by Kenny Blake, and defeated the then dominant Kawasaki Z1 900s on the day. It was sensational. The crowd loved it. Protests flew. Ron Angel immediately started advertising the bikes, saying a shipment was on the way. There was an investigation into the bona-fides of the bike by the governing body - the Auto Cycle Union of New South Wales. The bike was accepted when the Ducati factory sent a letter confirming that Ducati 860 SuperSports were being manufactured, and the ACU-NSW awarded the race to Blake and the 860 SuperSport. When the 900 SuperSport shipment finally did arrive, it was a different bike to the 860 SuperSport that had won Bathurst, but it was too late to matter. That special Bathurst bike had round cases, and looked identical to a green frame 750 SS, but with the 860 camshaft bearing mounts on the heads, and 860 SuperSport on the bike's side covers. Ron Angel later said that the bike had been built by Ducati at his request for the previous Bathurst, but was then ruled ineligible, so more work was done, and the bike was sent by sea, arriving in time for the race the following year, where it was presented as a production bike. It had special parts, including the Imola cams and the limited availability close ratio gearbox. The 2 kg inboard flywheel had been removed, but the bike did not have the straight cut primary gears of the Imola bikes. The camshaft bearing mounts were the only externally obvious 860 part. (The \"900\" models remained 860 cc.)\n\nRon Angel had previously brought Spaggiari's bike out to Australia after Imola, and Blake had ridden it in competition where the rules allowed. That bike had the straight cut primary gears.In 1976 Tartarini did a makeover on the 860GT creating the Ducati Darmah SD900. It was an immediate success. The only new Giugiaro cased bevel models after this were the Mike Hailwood Replica, a cosmetic version of the NCR racers, and the S2. Unlike the SuperSport, the MHR bikes were not thinly disguised race bikes, but road bikes dressed as racers.\n\nThe Mille engine was not just an overbore of the 860, but a complete redesign of the engine. It had a one piece forged nitrided crankshaft, with plain big-end bearings and a larger oil pump with the oil pressure at 80 psi. The new crankshaft had an 80 mm stroke, and with the 88 mm bore, gave a 973 cc engine, and a 5% improvement in power. The complete MHR Mille weighed 198 kg dry. The gearbox and final ratios were altered to give a better spread of ratios, so that the performance gain is a little better than the horsepower and weight figures would suggest. A kick-starter was no longer available. A Nippon Denso starter motor was standard. The giugiario engine covers had finally disappeared.\nThe engine was available in the MHR Mille and S2 Mille. The MHR outsold the S2 nine to one.\n\nThe 1971 750 GT evolved through the late 1972 750 Sport and 1974 750SS into the 1975 900SS and the 1982 Mike Hailwood Replicas. Despite other variations, all these frames kept the typical Seely style chain adjusters.\n\nBelt-driven camshafts\n(Pantah 500SL onwards)\n\nWhen the 350 cc and 500 cc vertical twins were recognised as a marketing disaster, Taglioni went to work on the Pantah.\n\nIt came onto the market in 1980 as the red and silver 500SL. It used the same bore and stroke as the old 500 racers, 74 mm x 58 mm, but had a 60 degree included valve angle and belt driven camshafts. They were noticeably lacking in bottom end and mid range torque, but revved freely enough. The handling seemed less certain, and the 35 mm front forks lacked rigidity.\n\nEnthusiasts soon found the final gearing too tall, and the intake and exhaust restrictive. If you changed those, you had a fast bike.\n\nIn 1981 Ducati Bipantah engine was derived by Pantah 500SL: it remained at prototype stage.\n\nIn 1981 the silver 600SL became available with fairing and hydraulic clutch activation. It had an 80 mm bore and the 58 mm stroke giving 583 cc (TT2 racer used 81 mm) By 1984 the last of the 600SL bikes had MHR paint.\n\nIn 1982 the 600TL was released, and the styling was promptly panned. They lasted till 1983.\n\nIn 1983 the 650SL came about because of the need to homologate the TT1 750 racer's 61.5 mm stroke. Instead of producing a production 750, the 650SL was born with 82 mm bore and the 61.5 mm stroke. Visually it was the same as the 600SL, but it had torque, and that was a big improvement.\n\nCagiva (CAstiglioni GIovanni VArese) company, founded by the Castiglioni brothers, took over Ducati Meccanica in 1985. Ducati engines promptly appeared in Cagiva motorcycles, such as the Cagiva Alazzurra, and the Cagiva Elefant.\n\nThe 650SL continued to be produced after the Cagiva take-over, and ended production in 1986.\n\nIn 1985 the Ducati F1 750 was released, based on the TT1 and TT2 racers, with full flow oil cooling rather than cylinder head bypass cooling, and cantilever rear suspension. The first production bikes used the same size valves as the 500 had, restricting performance. With its 1400 mm wheelbase, it was a smaller 750 than the world was used to, and ancillary parts were of mixed quality. Larger riders found it small, and the front wheel restricted tyre choice. Distinctive features included 38 mm Marzocchi front forks, fully floating disc brakes front and rear, hydraulically operated dry clutch, two into one exhaust, Nippon Denso instruments, and an aluminium petrol tank.\n\nIn 1986 the 750 F1 crankcases were strengthened, and now used straight cut primary gears, and a stronger gearbox. The valve sizes were increased to 41 mm and 35 mm, as used on the TT2, and this meant smaller 12 mm sparkplugs were fitted. Other features were 40 mm Forcella front forks, Veglia instruments, and a steel petrol tank.\n\nThis was the same year the liquid-cooled Desmoquattro engine appeared on a racer at 1986 24H of Montjuic. While air-cooled models are still produced, development since has focussed more on the liquid-cooled models.\n\nThe 750 F1 continued to be produced in 1987 and 1988. There were three limited edition models; the Montjuich, the Laguna Seca, and the Santa Monica. These used 40 mm Dell'Orto carburettors, hotter camshafts, a two into one Verlicchi exhaust, 4 piston Brembo calipers with fully floating discs all round, and an aluminium swingarm. These are considered the best of the 750 F1 models.\n\nIn the same way Ducati had sought Seely's frame expertise in 1970, Cagiva now went to Massimo Tamburini of Bimota to design a new frame and look for the 750 F1. The Ducati Paso was born, and was named in honour of Renzo Pasolini. The engine was no longer a stressed member of the frame. The cradle frame used M1R Marzocchi forks and rising rate rear suspension. It weighed 195 kg and had almost fully enclosed bodywork. The rear cylinder head was reversed so that both cylinders could share a single twin throat Weber carburettor. The Paso was the second proposal from Tamburini, the first, considered too expensive to produce by the Ducati board, became the Bimota DB1.\n\nThe Weber carburettor proved troublesome. Despite numerous tuning revisions owners were plagued with flat spots, backfiring, and throttle lag. The 750 Paso was produced until 1990.\n\nIn 1988 a 750 Sport was released, basically a Weber carbed Paso engine in a 750F1 frame, but with an aluminium swingarm.\n\nIn 1989 the liquid-cooled 906 Paso was introduced, with a 92 mm bore and 68 mm stroke, and a six speed gearbox, and weighing in at 205 kg.\n\nWith the release of the 906 Paso, an air-cooled version of the engine was put into a 1988 750 Sport frame, and the resulting bike called a 1989 900 SuperSport . It weighed just 180 kg, and came with a choice between full and half fairing. In 1990 the Weber was replaced by Mikuni 38 mm CV carburettors, with equal length intakes, while the frame was given a 25 degree steering rake, a reduced 1410 mm wheelbase, a new alloy swingarm, and an adjustable 41 mm Showa upside down forks.\n\nIn 1991 the liquid-cooled 907IE was released with Weber-Marelli fuel injection. Early in the model run the crankcases were strengthened, after some cracking in racing use. These had wheels, and four piston Brembo brake calipers. The 907IE ended production in 1992.\n\nAlso in 1991, a five speed 750 SuperSport was released with a single disc, and non-adjustable 41 mm Showa forks. A 400 SuperSport Junior was also released using the same 750SS running gear.\n\nThe 900 SuperLight appeared in 1992 as a limited edition model SuperSport with monoposto'' seat, upswept exhaust pipes, vented clutch cover, fully floating Brembo front discs, carbon fibre bits, and lightweight Marvic wheels and guards. In 1993 the vented clutch cover, fully floating Brembo front discs, and lightweight Marvic wheels and guards disappeared from the SuperLight, and there was now only the fully floating rear brake to differentiate the 900 SuperSport and SuperLight.\n\n1993 saw the introduction of the (M900) Ducati Monster, a 900 SuperSport motor in a modified 851 frame. It weighed 184 kg, and had a low seat height of 770 mm. It was not a race bike or a tourer, but a naked boulevard cruiser crossed with a traffic light dragster. It was quite a sales success.\n\nIn 1994 a five speed 600 SuperSport and a five speed 600 Monster appeared. It was the original specification motor and gearbox, with all the improvements of contemporary models added. The 750 SuperSport was updated with twin 320 mm front discs, and a steel swing arm. The 900 SuperSport and SuperLight received uprated Showa forks, and in 1995, an oil temperature gauge was added to the instruments.\n\nIn 1996 the M900 gained fully adjustable Marzocchi forks. This was also the year Texas Pacific Group bought a 51% stake in the company for US$325 million, thus taking over from Cagiva, and renamed the company 'Ducati Motor SpA.\n\nIn 1998 came the 944 cc liquid-cooled Ducati ST2 Sports Turismo, with an engine descended from the earlier Paso 906 and 907ie.\n\nIn 2000 the 1000SS (992 cc) was released, weighing 185 kg, with a 1395 mm wheelbase.\n\nIn late 2003 the 620SS, 800SS, and 1000DS came on the market, still two valve, but with a narrower included valve angle.\n\nThe Multistrada 1000DS was ostensibly a supermoto bike, but with a more upright seating position. The 1000DS was a two valve dual spark SuperSport. The 1000DS motor has a 992 cc air-cooled 90° V-Twin, based on Ducati's existing liquid and air-cooled engines, with twin-spark plug heads, pressure fed plain camshaft bearings, redesigned crankshaft, higher oil pressure and volume, and new alloy clutch basket, drive and driven plates. The Multistrada 1000DS uses Ducati's signature trellis frame with fully adjustable 160 mm travel Showa forks up front, and a single-sided swingarm, with an Öhlins fully adjustable rear shock coupled with a rising rate, height-adjustable suspension system at the rear. Brembo \"Serie Oro\" calipers used front and rear. Front 320 mm discs, Brembo four piston calipers, single 245 mm rear disc, and steel-braided brake lines front and rear. The discs are now mounted directly to oversized hubs, eliminating the disc carriers.\n\n## References\n\nV-twin\nV-twin engines"}

{"id": "6914833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare%20Terranova", "title": "Cesare Terranova", "text": "Cesare Terranova (; 25 August 1921 – 25 September 1979) was an Italian judge and politician from Sicily, notable for his anti-Mafia stance. From 1958 until 1971 Terranova was an examining magistrate at the Palermo prosecuting office. He was one of the first to seriously investigate the Mafia and the financial operations of Cosa Nostra. He was killed by the Mafia in 1979. \n\nCesare Terranova was the predecessor of judge Rocco Chinnici, who created the Antimafia Pool, a group of investigating magistrates who closely worked together sharing information to diffuse responsibility and to prevent one person from becoming the sole institutional memory and solitary target, like Terranova.\n\n## Early life and career\n\nCesare Terranova was born on 25 August 1921, in Petralia Sottana, a small town located at about 70 km southeast of Palermo, Sicily. He entered the judiciary in 1946. In 1958 he became the head of the Examining Office at the Palermo Court. At the time, the prosecution was separated in an examining phase, the so-called instruction phase, and a prosecuting phase. Terranova helped bring numerous Mafiosi to trial and imprisonment. He was a key figure in the Trial of the 114 which saw many prominent Mafiosi on trial for their role in the First Mafia War in the early 1960s, that ended with the Ciaculli massacre on 30 June 1963. On 31 May 1965, he ordered the prosecution of 114 mafiosi.\n\nDespite Terranova’s efforts, the sentence of the Trial of the 114 on 22 December 1968, by the Court in Catanzaro was a disappointment, and many prominent mafiosi were acquitted. All but 10 of the 114 defendants were acquitted. Angelo La Barbera got 22 years and Tommaso Buscetta received 14 years for two so-called “white deaths” - the so-called lupara bianca which is used to refer to a mafia-style murder in which the victim's body is deliberately hidden.\n\nTerranova was the first to acknowledge the existence of a Sicilian Mafia Commission. His knowledge was informed by confidential report of the Carabinieri of 28 May 1963, where a confidential informant revealed the existence of a commission composed of fifteen persons – six from Palermo city and the rest from towns in the province – \"each with the rank of boss of either a group or a Mafia family.\" Judge Terranova did not believe that the existence of a commission meant that the Mafia was a tightly unified structure.\n\nTerranova led investigations into the connections between the Mafia and politics. He looked into the exploits of the prominent Sicilian politician Salvatore Lima as mayor of Palermo, and concluded that Lima was in league with a number of Mafiosi, including Angelo La Barbera. In an indictment in 1964, Terranova wrote: \"it is clear that Angelo and Salvatore La Barbera (well-known bosses in the Palermo area) ... knew former mayor Salvatore Lima and maintained relations in such a way as to ask for favours. ... The undeniable contacts of the La Barbera mafiosi with the one who was the first citizen of Palermo ... constitute a confirmation of ... the infiltration of the Mafia in several sectors of public life.\" However, nothing came of his enquiries or allegations.\n\n## Prosecuting the Corleonesi\n\nTerranova made little attempt to hide the fact that his ambition was to bring Luciano Leggio, the boss of the Corleone Mafia Family – known as the Corleonesi – to justice. In 1965, Terranova ordered the prosecution of over sixty Corleonesi, including Leggio (Trial Leggio + 63), for a series of murders in Corleone from 1958 to 1963. The most prominent victim had been the Mafia-boss of Corleone, Michele Navarra.\n\nHowever, the sentence of the Bari Court on 10 June 1969 resulted in acquittals for all the 64 defendants. The jury found Leggio guilty of stealing grain in 1948, for which he received a suspended sentence, but he was pronounced not guilty on all other accounts, including the murders of Placido Rizzotto and Navarra. The judges and prosecutors received anonymous letters threatening them with death. Salvatore Riina – Leggio's eventual successor – was acquitted in 1969 and remained at large until his capture in 1993.\n\nThe Corleonesi were indicted in the Trial of the 114 related to the First Mafia War that resulted in the Ciaculli Massacre, that was also prepared by Terranova. During an interrogation preparing the trial, Leggio refused to answer questions. When in response to one of them, Leggio replied that he could not even recall his own name or his parents, Terranova instructed the clerk: \"Write that Leggio does not know whose son he is.\" Leggio was infuriated with the implication that he was a bastard. The incident was the beginning of a deep hatred by Leggio for Terranova. \n\n\"Leggio actually had foam on his lips; he would have killed me on the spot if he could,\" Terranova told his wife. The prosecution appealed successfully against the Catanzaro verdict that had acquitted Leggio and had him tried in absentia in 1970. This time Leggio was found guilty, although he had left jail after the Catanzaro trial, given the time they had already spent in detention while awaiting trial, and it was not until 1974 that Leggio was captured again and taken into custody.\n\n## Antimafia Commission\n\nAfter the failure to fight the Mafia through the courts, Terranova changed strategy. In May 1972, he was elected as a representative in the Italian Parliament for the Independent Left, under the auspices of the Italian Communist Party (PCI). He became the secretary of the Antimafia Commission that was established in 1963 after the Ciaculli massacre. He was re-elected in 1976. Terranova together with PCI deputy Pio La Torre wrote the 1976 minority report of the Antimafia Commission, which pointed to links between the Mafia and prominent politicians, in particular of the Christian Democrat party (DC - Democrazia Cristiana).\n\nTerranova urged his colleagues of the majority to take their responsibility. According to the minority report:\n… it would be a grave error on the part of the Commission to accept the theory that the Mafia-political link has been eliminated. Even today the behaviour of the ruling DC group in the running of the City and the Provincional Councils offers the most favourable terrain for the perpetuation of the system of Mafia power.\n\nThe reports and the documentation of the Antimafia Commission were essentially disregarded. Terranova talked of “thirteen wasted years” of the Antimafia Commission, and did not seek re-election again.\n\n## Death\n\nAfter seven years in Rome, at the end of the legislature in June 1979, Cesare Terranova asked to be re-instated in the judiciary. He was again appointed as the chief examining magistrate at the Court in Palermo to take the fight against the Mafia in the courts. \"Don't worry,\" he told his wife, \"they don't dare touch judges, they won't touch me.\"\n\nHowever, on 25 September 1979, then aged fifty-eight, Terranova was shot to death in his car, along with his driver, policeman Lenin Mancuso, who acted as his bodyguard. The combination of his investigative skills and his recent political connections in Rome would have made Terranova an even more formidable Mafia opponent than before. Taking Terranova’s place was Rocco Chinnici, who was murdered by the Mafia in 1983.\n\nWhile in prison, Luciano Leggio had ordered the killing of Terranova as a revenge for the insult at the interrogation in the 1960s. The murder was approved by the Mafia Commission. Terranova had become the worst enemy of Leggio and the Corleonesi. He had a photograph of Leggio in his office that his colleagues had given him as a joke. Leggio was charged with ordering Terranova's murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence, both in the first trial, which was held in Reggio Calabria in 1983, and in 1986, in the appeal process.\n\n## New Trial\n\nIn 1997, the prosecution office in Reggio Calabria re-opened the murder investigation after the pentiti Francesco Di Carlo and Gaspare Mutolo named the mafiosi Giuseppe Giacomo Gambino, Vincenzo Puccio, Giuseppe Madonia and Leoluca Bagarella as the material killers. Di Carlo confirmed that Leggio had ordered the killing of Terranova. \n\nIn 1974, when the Sicilian Mafia Commission was reorganized, Leggio through Totò Riina (Leggio was in jail) asked the Commission gathered at Michele Greco's estate Favarella for permission. The Commission decided, on instigation of Gaetano Badalamenti, that Terranova should be killed outside Sicily, in Rome. The killing was stalled because of plans to liberate Leggio. When that failed, Terranova's murder was on the agenda again and was confirmed in June 1979 during a Commission meeting at the Favarella estate.\n\nOn 15 January 2000, Salvatore Riina, Bernardo Brusca, Bernardo Provenzano, Francesco Madonia, Pippo Calò, Nenè Geraci and Michele Greco, all members of the Sicilian Mafia Commission at the time of the murder, were convicted to life sentences for ordering the murder of Terranova and Mancuso. Leggio had died. Leoluca Bagarella, Giuseppe Madonia and Giuseppe Farinella were acquitted as the material killers. After 25 years, in October 2004, the Supreme Court confirmed the life sentences for Totò Riina, Michele Greco, Nenè Geraci and Francesco Madonia.\n\n## Legacy\n\nDespite the fact that his prosecutions of the Mafia in the 1960s eventually failed in Court, Terranova was a pioneer in investigating the Mafia. His verdicts always included historical and theoretical aspects. He determined that there was \"only one Mafia, neither old or young, neither good nor bad,\" but \"efficient and dangerous, divided into clusters or groups or 'families,' or more accurate still, 'cosche.'\" At the time, his analysis of the Mafia was modern and advanced. In the 1960s, it was not understood and accepted by the judiciary, which considered him too \"bold\" or worse, \"imaginative\". The revelations in 1984 of a pentito (informant) from the Mafia, Tommaso Buscetta, would prove him right. \n\nTerranova paved the way for a more successful prosecution of the Mafia in the 1980s. He was the predecessor of judge Rocco Chinnici, who succeeded Terranova as the chief examining magistrate at the Court in Palermo and who also became a victim of a Mafia attack in July 1983. Chinnici created the Antimafia Pool, a group of investigating magistrates who closely worked together to diffuse responsibility and to prevent one person from becoming a solitary target, like Terranova. Chinnici signed all indictments, along with the magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, who were also killed by the Mafia in 1992, and other Sicilian judges, who presented a unified front to fight the Mafia. By joining efforts, they were a more difficult target for mafiosi, and preserved institutional memory by sharing information. Falcone and Borsellino prepared the Maxi Trial, that convicted 338 of the 475 Mafiosi members originally charged.\n\nCesare Terranova’s widow Giovanna became a prominent personality in the Antimafia movement after her husband was murdered. She co-founded the first permanent civil Antimafia organisation, the Associazione donne siciliane per la lotta contro la Mafia (Association of Sicilian Women against the Mafia). Giovanna Terranova said in an interview: \"I would have felt guilty if I had stayed at home. I would have thought: Cesare died for nothing. Yes, because being killed is terrible, but being forgotten is even worse. It’s like dying twice.\"\n\nIn January 1982, on the initiative of judge Chinnici, a research center in the name of Cesare Terranova, the Centro Studi Giuridici e Sociali \"Cesare Terranova\", was set up in Palermo to honour his memory.\n\n## Quotes\n\n\"The Mafia is oppression, arrogance, greed, self-enrichment, power and hegemony above and against all others. It is not an abstract concept, or a state of mind, or a literary term... It is a criminal organization regulated by unwritten but iron and inexorable rules... The myth of a courageous and generous 'man of honour' must be destroyed, because a mafioso is just the opposite.\"\n\n\"It is necessary to dismantle the myth of the mafioso as a brave and generous “man of honour”, since the mafioso is characterised by a totally opposite character…the mafioso shoots to the shoulder, by treachery, when he is secure to have the total control upon the victim… He is ready to any compromise, to any renunciation and to the worst mean actions in order to save himself in a dangerous situation… the consciousness that nobody will denounce him, and that hidden and influential forces will rush to his help, gives the mafioso arrogance and boldness, at least until the right and severe application of the law will reach him.\"\n\n## Depictions in works\n\n* Il Capo dei Capi, Italian crime drama miniseries\n\n## See also\n\n* List of victims of the Sicilian Mafia\n\n## References\n\n* Allum, Felia and Renate Siebert (eds.)

Access All Areas stated \"Just Say So is a ridiculously catchy electro-pop track with heavy auto tune and dance beats.\" Tim Byron of The Vine gave it a mixed review saying \"So it's not very surprising that the backing music on Just Say So sounds almost entirely synthesised; synth drums, synth bass and synthy keyboards. The AutoTune vocal effect on McFadden's vocals is so prominent that it not only destroys anything distinctive in the voice, but also makes the lyrics hard to hear. Kraftwerk wish their music could sound this mechanical.\"\n\n## Chart performance\n\nOn 25 April 2010, \"Just Say So\" debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and stayed at that position for three weeks. It spent seven weeks in the ARIA top ten and thirteen weeks in the top 50 and gained a platinum accreditation. The song became McFadden's second number-one single in Australia, after 2005's \"Almost Here\".\n\n## References\n\n2009 songs\n2010 singles\nBrian McFadden songs\nKevin Rudolf songs\nNumber-one singles in Australia\nSongs written by Robert Conley (music producer)\nSongs written by Brian McFadden"}

He was a visiting guest professor of photography at Harvard University in 2011. He taught as a visiting assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara for the departments of Studio Art and Asian American studies between 2007 and 2012. He is a recipient of The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans.\n\nSheng's photography work has been described as \"historic\" in capturing the social progress experienced by the LGBT community in the United States in the early 21st century.\n\nHis 2009-2011 photography series \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" documented almost 100 closeted LGBT United States military service members affected by the Don't ask, don't tell policy, that forbid United States military service members from openly identifying as gay or lesbian. Sheng's photographs of these closeted service members were widely published and reported on by the media during the Congressional repeal of the policy between 2010 and 2011, including in TIME Magazine, Newsweek, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, CNN, ABC World News, CBS Evening News, NPR, and the BBC News; and his photographs were extensively circulated among service members, military officials in the Pentagon, as well as members of Congress during the repeal process. Commenting about Sheng's work, Pulitzer Prize winning columnist Leonard Pitts wrote, \"There is something sharply poignant in these images of those who do dangerous work most of us never have, make sacrifices most of us never will, yet are forced to hide their faces for fear of what it would mean if we knew who they are... The result was this stirring work that has been featured everywhere from the New York Times to the Los Angeles Times to CNN to the BBC.\"\n\nOn June 23, 2012, Sheng photographed the civil union of Will Behrens and air force service member Erwynn Umali, the first public same-sex wedding ceremony held on a United States military base and officiated by a military chaplain, since the official repeal of Don't ask, don't tell on September 20, 2011.\n\nSheng first became known for his photographic project \"Fearless\", a series of portraits of athletes on high school and college sports teams who also openly identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Sheng began the project in 2003, and by 2012, the series had over 150 portraits of athletes from the United States and Canada. Sheng has exhibited the project at over fifty colleges and high schools across the United States. \"Fearless\" has also been exhibited at the headquarters of sports media network ESPN, the 2009 LGBT Human Rights Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, and Nike World Headquarters.\n\nFor the 2012 Summer Olympics, Sheng released a 10-minute video slideshow of \"Fearless\" that was exhibited at Pride House 2012 as part of the London Olympics, which marked the debut of the project in Great Britain.\n\nIn August 2008, Sheng collaborated with former N.B.A. basketball player and fellow activist John Amaechi in Beijing, China during the 2008 Summer Olympics, on a blog in partnership with Amnesty International. Amaechi utilized Sheng's knowledge of Mandarin and previous experience as an American exchange student in Beijing to get behind the scenes in many situations and to gather candid interviews with local people and Olympic athletes.\n\nIn 2004, Sheng photographed Evan Wolfson and Mary Bonauto for The New York Times Magazine for an in-depth article written by David J. Garrow about the struggle over the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts and the United States.\n\nSheng attended Harvard University and studied under the mentorship of British photographer and Harvard professor Chris Killip in the Visual and Environmental Studies Department. For his senior thesis submitted to Harvard in 2002 for his BA degree, Sheng created a small photo album titled \"Thesis Album,\" consisting of sixty 4\" by 6\" photographs of his personal same-sex relationship from college, with just half a page of writing. His senior thesis was awarded a Latin honors grade of summa cum laude, nominated for a Thomas T. Hoopes, Class of 1919, Prize, and Sheng was given the college's Louis Sudler Prize in the Arts by then President of Harvard University Lawrence Summers. In 2002 and 2003, Sheng interned for gallery owner and art curator WM Hunt (Bill Hunt) in New York City, and then briefly assisted for the celebrity/fashion photographer Greg Gorman in Los Angeles.\n\nSheng received his Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Studio Art from the University of California, Irvine in 2007. His MFA Thesis Exhibition included a large forty foot wide by six foot high digitally constructed panoramic photographic installation, titled \"Where Matthew Lay Dying: Laramie, Wyoming,\" originally shot and taken from the spot and vantage point where the hate crime/murder victim Matthew Shepard was found on a fence post outside Laramie, Wyoming.\n\nSheng is currently a doctoral PhD candidate in Sociology at Stanford University.\n\n## External links\n\n* Jeff Sheng's official site\n\n* FearlessProject.org\n\n## References\n\nLiving people\nAmerican people of Taiwanese descent\nAmerican photographers\nAmerican gay artists\nAmerican LGBTQ people of Asian descent\nAmerican LGBTQ rights activists\nAmerican people of Chinese descent\nHarvard University alumni\nPaul & Daisy Soros Fellows\nStanford University alumni\nUniversity of California, Irvine alumni\nYear of birth missing (living people)\nLGBTQ people from California\nAmerican LGBTQ photographers"}

Originally based in Britain, he had been out of the country when authorities began arresting members of his organisation (including his own son, Brian Jr, and former son-in-law, Paul Shannon) as the result of a six-year investigation resulting from the capture of a converted fishing trawler, the Sea Mist, after Irish customs officials discovered 599 kg of cocaine while docked at Cork, Ireland in September 1996.\n\nEventually relocating to northern Cyprus, he purchased a £300,000 villa near occupied Lapithos in the name of a Turkish Cypriot friend and, by 1998, his organization operated freely as the northern Cyprus government is recognized only by Turkey and thus has no extradition treaties with any other country.\n\nIn 2002, British authorities announced the capture of a leading member of his organisation, South African drug trafficker Hilton John Van Staden, who eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to smuggle drugs into the country, with customs officials claiming the destruction of Wright's organisation.\n\nIn April 2005, he was arrested by police in Sotogrande, Spain.\n\nOn 2 April 2007, after an 11-year investigation, he was found guilty of running an international cocaine smuggling empire.

It was formed by Gunnar Lárus Hjálmarsson and Þór Eldon Jónsson (Thor Eldon) in 1993. They were joined by Ragnheiður Eiríksdóttir (Heiða) in 1994. The group disbanded in July 1999.\n\n## Biography\n\nThe group was formed in 1993 by guitarist Þór Eldon Jónsson (formerly Fan Houtens Koko, of The Sugarcubes, aka Thor Eldon, and former husband of Björk), bassist Gunnar Lárus Hjálmarsson (Dr. Gunni, former SH Draumur, ex-Bless). The name appeared during a game of Scrabble. They were then joined by Kristín Jónsdóttir on vocals, then the trio goes back to Gunni's apartment. On April 1, 1994, they began recording their first studio album, titled Æ. During their sessions, the singer Ragnheiður Eiríksdóttir (Heiða) becomes a member of the group. In November 1994, their first album was released on the label Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). Jóhann Jóhannsson (formerly of Daisy Hill Puppy Farm), co-produces and plays keyboards on this album.\n\nIn the spring of 1995, the Icelandic lyrics of Æ are translated into English and the English version, Super Shiny Dreams, is released on the Bad Taste label in November 1995 in the United States and Europe. Björk is supported by Unun for three British dates, including an appearance at Wembley Arena in January 1996. In 1997, the group participates in the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. In 1998, the group lost its contract with the label Deceptive, but managed to publish a four-track EP called Bones. Thor performs his last concert with Unun at the Midt Fyn Festival. Back in Iceland, the band records their second album, Ótta, with Birna on keyboards, Viddi (ex-Quarashi) on bass, and Doddi (Kanada) on drums. The following year Unun toured Norway, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland.

He studied classical music at the Caracas Conservatory in Venezuela before developing a taste for rock, jazz, and New Age. \nHe died in San Diego, California in the spring of 2020 at the age of 85 or 86.\n\n## Early life\n\nBarabas was born in 1934 in Hungary, where he spent his childhood. He began playing music at the age of four in Budapest. By age 12, he had attracted the interest and praise of his piano instructors and he made his public debut at the Liszt Conservatory of Music.\n\nIn 1949 his family emigrated to Venezuela where he studied classical piano and composition at the Venezuela Conservatory of Music in Caracas, earning his master's degree in 1957. In 1966, Barabas emigrated to the US, living and composing in San Diego, California.\n\n## Live performance\n\nBarabas's compositional style was distinguished by the influences of his classical Conservatory training, the Latin and Caribbean pop music of Venezuela and North American rock and roll.\n\nAfter a successful career performing daily on stage, radio and television in Venezuela, Barabas moved to San Diego in 1966 seeking greater opportunities. The Southern California music scene inspired and cultivated his interest in jazz and soon he was opening for figures such as Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans and Ramsey Lewis. He later became the house pianist for a five-star resort, and it was during his tenure there that he began playing his own compositions.\n\n## Commercial success\n\nBarabas released 12 CD's, three of which made the Billboard Charts. Sedona Suite charted number 12 and held that position for 29 weeks. Other albums of note include Wind Dancer (with Dean Evenson), reaching Billboard's Top-15, and Classica Nouveau, which reached number 18 on Billboard's Top-20.\n\nBarabas and Dean Evenson enjoyed a long friendship and collaborated on several Soundings albums including Soaring, WindDancer, Back to the Garden and Healing Suite.\n\nBarabas wrote and performed an original composition for the Heartkeys AIDS Benefit Concert and the Heartkeys album, and performed for the American Cancer Society and the AIDS Foundation of America.

{"id": "6921752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lei%20tai", "title": "Lei tai", "text": "The lei tai is an elevated fighting arena, without railings, where often fatal weapons and bare-knuckle martial arts tournaments were once held. \"Sanctioned\" matches were presided over by a referee on the platform and judges on the sides. Participants would lose if they surrendered, were incapacitated, or were thrown or otherwise forced from the stage. The winner would remain on the stage (as its \"owner\") unless ousted by a stronger opponent. If there were no more challengers, they would become the champion. Private duels on the stage had no rules and were sometimes fought to the death.\n\nThe lei tai first appeared in ancient China, and in its present form during the Song dynasty. However, ancient variations of it can be traced back to at least the Qin dynasty. Today it is used in Sanshou and Kuoshu competitions throughout the world.\n\n## Etymology\n\nAccording to Kung Fu Magazine, the Chinese character '' (in Mandarin lèi or léi) combines the word for \"thunder\" (léi 雷) with the radical for \"hand\" (shǒu 手). It can mean, \"to give an open challenge.\" But taken literally, it means to \"beat (a drum)\". Tái means \"stage\" or \"platform.\" It is also commonly referred to as a Dǎ lèi tái (Traditional: 打擂臺 Simplified: 打擂台 – \"Fight Beat (a drum) Platform\"). The character for Dǎ combines the word for \"robust or vigorous\" (dīng 丁) with the radical for \"hand\" (shǒu 手). This can mean, \"to strike, hit, beat, or fight\". In Cantonese, using the Wade-Giles superscript number system, Lei tai is pronounced Leui4 Toi4. A common English rendering of this is \"Lui Toi or Loey Toy\". Da lei tai is pronounced Da1 leui4 toi4 or Da2 leui4 toi4.\n\nThe Chinese military once used a Zhong Jun Lei Gu Tai (中军擂鼓台 – \"Central Military Drum Beating Platform\") to drum out commands on the battlefield and to tell time in the capital city. (see Gulou and Zhonglou) Three kingdoms general Zhang Fei used a \"drum beating platform\" to teach his soldiers troop movements. It is possible that the lei tai received its name from this type of platform, since a superior fighter might \"beat\" his opponent like a drum.\n\n## Dimensions\n\nThe fighting area is square, but its exact size varies from source to source.\n\n* The Swiss Open Kusohu Tournament states the classical lei tai fights took place on a stage at least 2.5 meters high and had a four-sided area of 100 square meters.\n\n* The Tien Shan Pai Association states it was either 24 x or 30 x and 2– high.\n\n* The International Wushu Federation and Chinese Wushu Association commissions a lei tai which is 24 x and high. The surrounding mats are long and thick. It is called the \"Nine Suns Mountain Sanda Lei tai\". It was used in the 8th World Wushu Championships held in Vietnam in December 2005.\n\n* The International Chinese Kuoshu Federation uses a stage 24 x and high.\n\n* According to the book Chinese Fast Wrestling for Fighting: The Art of San Shou Kuai Jiao Throws, Takedowns, & Ground-Fighting, it was 24 x and high.\n\n* The World Sports Encyclopedia says it is \"an 8x8m platform...elevated approx. 6 m and surrounded by rubber walls.\"\n\n## History (prior to 1928)\n\nIn ancient China, combat sport appeared in the form of Leitai, a no-holds-barred mixed combat sport that combined Chinese martial arts, boxing and wrestling. Lei tai in its present form appeared during the Song dynasty when it was used for boxing and Shuai Jiao exhibition matches and private duels. According to the Chinese Kuoshu Institute (UK), an ancestor of the lei tai was used during the Qin dynasty to hold Jiao Li wrestling competitions between imperial soldiers. The winner would be chosen to act as a bodyguard to the emperor or a martial arts instructor for the Imperial Military.\n\nAccording to Cung Le, a famous mixed martial arts fighter, \"In the old days, if you wanted to announce yourself as a boxer in a new village, you built a lei tai, stood on it, and invited all comers to try and knock you off.\" Some fighters issued their challenge in the form of a hand written letter to the person they wished to face. This form of challenge was illustrated in the movie Fearless, when Jet Li's character challenges another warrior to a fight. The book Ultimate Sparring: Principles & Practices comments, \"martial artists conducted 'Challenge matches' [on the lei tai] to test each other's skills, because of a personal dispute, or to prove one martial system's superiority over another system.\" Either fighter lost the match and his credibility if he fell, was forced off or was knocked to the floor of the stage. As a result, no one would want to learn boxing from him. The winner of the bout became the \"owner of the platform\" and remained on stage unless he was forced off himself. If there were no more challengers, he became the champion and or established the dominance of his style in that area. Another way was to defeat an already established master on the lei tai and then take over his school.\n\nIn order to become a champion, a fighter had to defeat countless opponents. For instance, Lama Pai Grandmaster Wong Yan-Lam set up his own lei tai platform in front of Hai Tung Monastery in Guangdong after having worked as a famous bodyguard in Northern China. For 18 days, he fought over 150 other martial artists and was never defeated. According to Hop Gar Grandmaster David Chin, \"Either the challenger was maimed or killed. Wong never let one challenger leave his school without injury. He was a master of using the technique of cruelty.\" Shortly afterwards, he was elected as the leader of the Ten Tigers of Canton, who were the top ten kung fu men in Guangdong. Eighteenth generation Chen-style tai chi Grandmaster Chen Zhaopi, third nephew of Chen Fake, set up a platform by Beijing's \"Xuan Wu Men\" city gate after an unauthorized article claiming the superiority of Chen-style tai chi appeared in the Beijing Times, causing many martial artists to challenge his skills. Over the course of 17 days, he defeated over 200 people and made many friends. If these examples are followed, it took a fighter anywhere from 17 to 18 days and 150–200 plus consecutive wins to establish their style's dominance in that area.\n\nAll weapons and boxing matches were conducted without protective gear like the Jissen Kumite (full-contact fighting) of Kyokushin Karate. On top of being forced from or thrown to the floor of the stage, the fights sometimes continued until either boxer conceded defeat, was severely injured and could no longer fight, or was even killed. One example of a death on stage was described by Hung Gar Grandmaster Chiu Kow (1895–1995), father of Grandmaster Chiu Chi Ling. The fight took place between Hung Gar Master Leng Cai Yuk and a triad boss named Ha Saan fu, who was also a master of Internal martial arts. Because Ha dealt in prostitution, gambling, and drugs, Leng challenged Ha to a lei tai bout to halt the expansion of his criminal territory. Ha accepted the challenge and agreed to leave the area if he lost.\n\nHa had previously heard of Master Leng's ability to tear at the flesh of his opponents with his bare hands, so he wrapped his torso with a leather strap prior to the fight. Both men met on the lei tai some time later and signed a contract that stated the fight could end in death. The crowd watched as both initiated combat. After a few moments, Leng (apparently seeing the leather straps through his ripped clothing) bypassed Ha's armor by forcing his hand down from the top of the wrap and tore out the triad boss' bowels. When Ha fell dead to the stage, his men tried attacking Leng to exact revenge, but the local police quickly arrested Leng to protect him. He was eventually set free.\n\nHowever, the railless architecture of the lei tai allowed a fighter to escape serious injury if they faced a more powerful opponent. All they had to do was leap down from the stage. This constituted a loss, but the boxer lived to fight another day. Despite this option, the Nationalist government banned the old traditions of private duels on the lei tai in 1928 because too many people were dying.\n\n## National boxing competitions\n\nIn order to screen the best practitioners for teaching positions at the newly founded Central Guoshu Institute, and in the provincial schools, Generals Zhang Zhi Jiang (张之江) (1882–1966), Li Liejun (1882–1946) and Li Jinglin (1885–1931) held the first modern full contact, national competition in October 1928. Many traditional masters did not compete because they believed their skills could only be proven in serious duels and not \"sporting\" contests. However, the event attracted hundreds of the best Chinese martial artists who participated in boxing, weapons and wrestling in a lei tai ring format. But after the first several days, the fighting competitions had to be halted because two masters were killed and many more seriously injured. The final 12 contestants were not permitted to continue for fear of killing off some of the greatest masters of the time. The overall winner was voted on by a jury of his peers. Many of the \"Top 15\" finishers (some being Xingyi boxers) went on to teach at the institute.\n\nIn 1929, the governor of Guangdong Province invited some of the institute's masters (including some of those that had competed in the 1928 lei tai) to come south to establish a \"Southern Kuoshu Institute\". General Li Jinglin chose five masters to represent northern China. These men were known as the Wu hu xia jiangnan (五虎下江南 – \"Five tigers heading south of Jiangnan\"):\n\n* Gu Ruzhang (1893–1952) of Northern Shaolin style. He was famously known as \"Iron Palm Gu Ruzhang\". He placed in the \"Top 15\" of the 1928 lei tai;\n\n* Wan Laisheng (1903–1995) of Northern Shaolin and Internal styles (including Natural Boxing);\n\n* Fu Zhensong (1881–1953) of Baguazhang style;\n\n* Wang Shaozhou (王绍周) of Northern Shaolin and Cha styles and\n\n* Li Xianwu of Northern Shaolin and Internal styles.\n\nIn 1933, the institute again hosted the national competition. The rules said, \"...if death occurs as a result of boxing injuries and fights, the coffin with a body of the deceased will be sent home.\" Winners of this contest include:\n\n* Chang Dongsheng (1908–1986) of Shuai Jiao style. He won the heavy weight division and earned the martial nickname \"Flying Butterfly\";\n\n* Wang Yushan (王玉山) (1892–1976) of Taichi Praying Mantis style and\n\n* Li Kunshan (1894–1976) of Plum Blossom Praying Mantis style.\n\n## Kuoshu (lei tai full-contact fighting)\n\nDiffering mainly in regulations, such as Kuoshu's allowing competitors to strike the same place twice, kuoshu and sanshou are examples of how popular the overall concept of full-contact kung fu has become. Though a few see a stringent dividing line between the sports, some such as Anthony Goh, president of the United States of America Wushu Kungfu Federation, see less contrast. \"The rules will always be slightly different,\" says Goh, but \"the various names all mean the same thing.\"\n\nOthers see the distinction as primarily historical. Huang Chien Liang, president of the United States Kuoshu Federation and The World Kuoshu Federation, notes that \"Kuoshu has another meaning as 'national art.' In 1928, the Central Kuoshu Academy was formed, and they sponsored a full-contact tournament, but when the Chinese Communist Party took over China, the Nationalist government moved to Taiwan, where, in 1955, they held a full-contact tournament, calling it lei tai. At that time, they used the original rules; no protection, and no weight class – whatever number you picked up, you fought together.\n\nIn 1975, Taiwan sponsored the first World Kuoshu Championship Tournament, and started to have weight class division. The second tournament also took place in Taiwan and was won by Peter Ralston, the first non-Asian to do so. The current president of the United States Kuo Shou Federation Huang Chien-Liang brought six of his students as a team to the 3rd World Kuoshu Championship tournament in Hawaii in 1980. This world tournament, sponsored and organized by an international Kuoshu federation in Taiwan, featured top Chinese stylists from around the world. Although they were nervous about the competition, Huang's students performed surprisingly well. They captured top placing in several divisions, including forms and full contact fighting. In total, they took home six trophies. In 1986, Huang assembled another team to participate in the 5th World Kuoshu Championship. Huang served as Head Coach of the U.S. team. The 6th Championship took place in 1989 So by 1992, Taiwan had already sponsored seven Kuoshu lei tai fighting events.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, \"Kuoshu had been oppressed during the Cultural Revolution,\" notes president Huang, \"and martial arts was then allowed only for performance until 1979, when wushu was allowed to include self-defense, so practitioners began writing the rules for the Sanshou Wushu tournaments, and the Communist government held a tournament called Sanshou.\"\n\nConfirming the common direction of Kuoshu and Sanshou toward safety, however, president Huang approves of the rules changes in full-contact kung fu. \"In 1986, at the fifth world tournament in Taiwan, they had a separate weight class, but still no protection. So many people suffered a broken nose and other injuries.\" As a result, the International Kuoshu Federation decided to change the rules. \"So since 1988, the new rules apply.\"\n\n## Sanshou / Sanda\n\nAs previously stated, martial arts were only allowed for performance purposes until 1979. But in March of that year, the Zhejiang Provincial Sports Training Center, Beijing Physical Education University (former Beijing Physical Education Institute), and Wuhan Physical Education College were convened by the government-appointed China National Sport Committee (CNSC) to transform Sanshou into a competitive sport. By October, the first three Sanshou teams were created from fighters chosen from the aforementioned wushu colleges. Even more teams were gathered in May 1980.\n\nThe first official Sanshou rules were drafted in January 1982 when the CNSC convened the National Sanshou Competition Rules Conference in Beijing. Six teams consisting of the Shandong, Hebei and Guangdong provincial teams, the Beijing Physical Education University and City teams and the Wuhan Physical Education College team were summoned to the conference to help formulate the regulations and points system of the sport. Ten months later, the very first Sanshou competition was held in November 1982. The original fighting area was a nine-meter diameter open circle, but it was later changed to a traditional square lei tai.\n\nAccording to Shuai Jiao Grandmaster Liang Shou Yu, \"In the past, San Shou competition was held on the Lei Tai, a 24 x platform high. Victory was decided when an opponent was thrown off the Lei Tai or knocked to the floor. Therefore, Shuai Jiao is an important part of San Shou fighting. A martial artist without any Shuai Jiao skills would not easily survive a San Shou match.\"\n\nKung Fu Magazine states just throwing someone off the lei tai in a Sanshou match is 3 points, which is \"the [points] equivalent of a spinning hook kick to the head, or a perfect foot sweep.\"\n\n(For Kuoshu and Sanshou competition rules, see \"Rule Books\" in External links below.)\n\n## Water lei tai\n\nThe city of Taizhou, Zhejiang hosted the first \"On Water Contest of the 'Liqun Cup' International Traditional Wushu and Unique Feats Tournament\" from May 22–26, 1999. It was here that 24 countries and 28 Chinese national teams, over a thousand competitors in all, gathered to test their skills against each other.\n\nThe water lei tai was held on the afternoon of the second day of competition (May 23). There were five divisions and it was the most attended event of the tournament. The event was made more difficult when it rained just prior to the matches, making the fighting surface very slippery. Also fighters were restricted to minimal safety equipment, only gloves and shorts. The defeated, who fell or was forced off the stage, landed in water. To improve safety, the lei tai was a meter shorter than a standard one, which lessened the impact and allowed assistants to quickly jump in the pool to rescue any fighter who might have been unconscious. No serious injuries were recorded during this event.\n\nThere have been more water lei tai's held since this event. In March 2004, the 9th International Chinese Kuoshu Federation (ICKF) World Championship hosted the 3rd water lei tai. The tournament venue was Aquatic Training Centre, Tainan Canal, Tainan, Taiwan. This was the first International event hosted by the ICKF to be held entirely on water.\n\n## Strategy\n\nKung Fu Magazine states the lei tai's railless architecture does not allow a fighter to trap an opponent in the turnbuckle, so the fighting strategy shifts away from power boxing to more evasive \"circling\" maneuvers. Nor can a fighter just rush their adversary. A quick redirection will send a charging opponent off the stage. And falling off can hurt, so fighters must deal with an added psychological factor when they approach the edge. Like Japanese sumo, a fighter must stand their ground. Falling out-of-bounds constitutes a loss.\n\n## Sparring benefits\n\nAccording to the Swiss Open Kusohu Tournament, lei tai permits the kung fu student to show their understanding of the techniques, moves, rooting, breathing and control of character (i.e. anger).

The Crimson Tide was led by first-year head coach Gene Stallings, replacing Bill Curry who left for the University of Kentucky.\n\nEarly in the 1990 season, the Tide and new coach Gene Stallings lost three games by a combined total of eight points. In the opener against Southern Miss, star tailback Siran Stacy tore ligaments in his knee and missed the rest of the season. Against Florida, Alabama lost another star player for the year in wide receiver Craig Sanderson and quarterback Gary Hollingsworth threw three interceptions to Florida safety Will White, and the Gators scored the winning touchdown on a blocked punt.\n\nAfter wins over lightly regarded Vanderbilt and SW Louisiana (now Louisiana-Lafayette), Bama traveled to Knoxville to face undefeated, third-ranked Tennessee. The result was a shocking 9–6 upset victory, Alabama's fifth in a row in the Third Saturday in October rivalry. The game was a defensive struggle and a field goal duel. UT's kicker Greg Burke, who hit a 51-yard field goal try to tie the game with ten minutes left, attempted a 50-yarder for the win with 1:35 to go, but Alabama's Stacy Harrison blocked the kick and the ball bounced to the Tennessee 37-yard line. The Crimson Tide advanced the ball seven yards on three running plays, setting up Philip Doyle's third field goal, a game-winning 48-yarder as time expired.\n\nThe next game was a 9–0 loss to Penn State in which Hollingsworth threw five interceptions and Bama rushed for only six yards. However, Alabama bounced back to win four in a row and salvage a winning season after the 0–3 start. Alabama won its first Iron Bowl in five years, dominating Auburn defensively and winning 16–7. It was the seventh game in a row in which the Alabama defense held the opposition to single digits.

The name RavenCon was chosen as a tribute to author Edgar Allan Poe, who lived in Richmond for a time. The convention runs over 300 hours of programming and activities featuring authors and panelists across genres, including horror, sci-fi, fantasy, military fiction, and other areas of fan cultures.\n\n## The Webster Award\n\nIn 2018, RavenCon launched The Clarence Howard “Bud” Webster Award in memory of friend of the convention, Bud Webster, who passed away in 2016. The award is to recognize outstanding achievements in writing by Virginia writers.\n\n## Past winners\n\n* 2018 Chris Kennedy for The Golden Horde\n\n* 2019 Cass Morris for From Unseen Fire\n\n* 2021 R.S. Belcher for The Ghost Dance Judgement\n\n* 2022 R.R. Virdi for The First Binding \n\n* 2023 Chris Semtner for Haunting Poe: Edgar Allan Poe's Afterlife in Richmond and Beyond\n\n## Programming\n\nAs of 2024 RavenCon has over 12 different tracks of programming featuring author book readings, animation, art/artists, costuming, current events, science/technology, writing, gaming and literature among them.\n\n## Book Launches\n\nOver the years the convention has hosted numerous book launches. In 2023 they hosted the launch party for Murderbirds: An Avian Anthology, edited by Mike Jack Stombous.\n\n## Music and media\n\nThe convention runs multiple musical panels and concerts with a focus on filking acts and filk writing workshops.\n\n## Gaming\n\nThe convention runs a 24/3 gaming room which includes board games, miniature games, collectible card games, role playing games and more. Events are run by seasoned game masters to just pick up and go.\n\n## Masquerade\n\nRavenCon hosts an open to all cosplay contest the Saturday night of the convention. They also have a hall cosplay contest for those not wanting to brave the stage.\n\n## Themed events\n\nRavenCon 16 also saw the introduction of The Gothic Wonderland Tea Party. In 2016 RavenCon also hosted FanHistoricon 13, with a track of panels and guests that focused exclusively on the history of fandom.\n\nStarting in 2019 RavenCon started running themed Escape Room's for the guests, like Vampire Masquerade and Multiversal Mayhem. In 2022 they started a 2nd Escape Room.\n\n## Move from Richmond to Williamsburg\n\nRavenCon 2015 was the last time that RavenCon would be held at the DoubleTree by Hilton Richmond-Midlothian in North Chesterfield, Virginia, when the owner of the hotel, Shamin hotels of Chester, Virginia, asked for a 600 percent increase in rates. Following this, RavenCon moved from Richmond and later events would be held in Williamsburg, Virginia at the DoubleTree by Hilton Williamsburg.\n\n## Concert events/RavenConcert\n\nIn addition to its annual spring author-focused convention, RavenCon has experimented with music-focused events later in the year.\n\nRavenCon 13.5 was held September 21–23, 2018 at the Four Points Sheraton Richmond, off of Midlothian Turnpike. This was a much smaller convention, with a primary focus on music. R.S. Belcher was author guest of honor, and the music guests of honor were MC Lars, George Hrab, Reverend Billy C. Wirtz, and Misbehavin' Maidens.\n\nRavenCon 14.5 was a one-day outdoor concert held on August 8, 2021 at Virginia Crossings Hotel and Conference Center in Glen Allen, Virginia. Mikey Mason, Dimensional Riffs, Chuck Parker, Dirty Metal Lefty, and Dr. Shock and the Electrodes were the performers.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nRavenCon 15 had been scheduled to take place in April 2020 and was cancelled a few weeks before the convention. It was rescheduled for April 2021 and then cancelled again. To raise money for refunds and to keep the convention operating during the two years of cancellations, authors donated stories for an anthology with the proceeds going to the convention. The fundraiser was successful, and the convention produced CORVID-19: A RavenCon Anthology, edited by Michael D. Pederson.\n\n## Return to Richmond\n\nRavenCon's concert events marked a brief return to Richmond which was made permanent when they signed a contract with Virginia Crossings Hotel and Conference Center in Glen Allen, Virginia. After RavenCon 14.5, all future events would be held in Richmond.\n\n## External links\n\n* \n\n2006 establishments in Virginia\nScience fiction conventions in the United States\nCulture of Richmond, Virginia\nFestivals in Virginia\nTourist attractions in Richmond, Virginia\nRecurring events established in 2006"}

He may be known best for the first of two children's novels based on Greek mythology, written with Leon Garfield, illustrated by Charles Keeping, and published by Longman in 1970. For The God Beneath the Sea Blishen and Garfield won the 1970 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject.\n\nThere is also his series of autobiographical books, including A Cack-Handed War (1972), a story describing his experiences as a conscientious objector, set against the backdrop of the Second World War, and Roaring Boys (1955), an honest account of teaching in a London secondary modern school in the 1950s, a book still valuable to understand teaching in a \"rough\" part of a city. Its sequel, This Right Soft Lot, was published in 1969. He finished the concluding volume of his autobiographical sequence, Mind How You Go, in 1996, just before his death; it was published posthumously by Constable in 1997.\n\n## Biography\n\nEdward Blishen was born in Barnet, Hertfordshire, England. He attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Barnet, and after failing his exams at the age of 17 he left school to work on a local newspaper.\n\nWhen the Second World War was declared he registered as a conscientious objector (CO), although he came from a long line of soldier ancestors. His father had served in the First World War, from which he returned wounded, suffering from shell shock and silent about his experiences. As Blishen recalled: \"He wasn't sympathetic to pacifists. He felt that if he had fought a war, then I ought to fight a war as well.\" But having read some of the now-famous books revealing the horrors of the First World War, the younger Blishen realised: \"I can't be somebody who does that to someone else.\" Registering as a CO was an uncomfortable experience: \"Everybody was declaring themselves at one counter, and there was this other forlorn counter for you to declare you weren't going to join in. It felt as though you were separating yourself from the rest of the world.\"\n\nLater, he taught for three years teaching in a Hampstead prep school, before going on to a secondary modern school in Holloway Road, north London, where he wrote his best-selling first book, Roaring Boys, in 1955. Following its success, he gave up teaching in 1959 – although he did some part-time teaching at York University between 1963 and 1965 – in order to devote more time to writing and then to developing a career in broadcasting. Fans of Roaring Boys and its sequel, This Right Soft Lot, ranged from the novelist Kingsley Amis to former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.\n\nFor more than 33 years, from its inception in 1961 until, at least, 1994, Blishen was the editor of the Junior Pears Encyclopaedia, published by Pelham Books.\n\nBlishen had a regular column in The Young Elizabethan.\n\nAs a broadcaster, Blishen did some notable work with the BBC's African Service and later was a presenter of the BBC Radio 4 programme A Good Read and regular contributor to Stop the Week.\n\nHe also compiled a number of collections in the Kingfisher Treasury of Stories series and Children’s Classics to Read Aloud.\n\nIn June 1995, Blishen was awarded an Honorary Degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University.\n\nHe died in Hadley Wood, Hertfordshire, in 1996, at the age of 76. He had two sons and was married to Nancy Smith.\n\n## Selected works\n\n* Mind How You Go (Constable, 1997)\n\n* The Disturbance Fee (Hamish Hamilton, 1988)\n\n* The Outside Contributor (Hamish Hamilton, 1986)\n\n* A Second Skin (Hamish Hamilton, 1984)\n\n* Donkey Work (Hamish Hamilton, 1983)\n\n* Lizzie Pye (Hamish Hamilton, 1982)\n\n* Shaky Relations: An autobiography (Hamish Hamilton, 1981)\n\n* A Nest of Teachers (Hamish Hamilton, 1980; Allison & Busby, 1985)\n\n* Sorry, Dad (Hamish Hamilton, 1978; Allison & Busby, 1984)\n\n* Uncommon Entrance (Thames & Hudson, 1974; Trafalgar Square Publishing, 1983)\n\n* The Golden Shadow (Longman, 1973) ‡\n\n* A Cack-Handed War (Thames & Hudson, 1972)\n\n* The God Beneath the Sea (Longman, 1970) ‡\n\n* This Right Soft Lot (Thames & Hudson, 1969; Panther, 1971)\n\n* Roaring Boys: A Schoolmaster's Agony (Thames & Hudson, 1955; Panther, 1966)\n\n ‡ by Blishen and Leon Garfield, illustrated by Charles Keeping\n\n## References\n\n \n\n1920 births\n1996 deaths\n20th-century English educators\n20th-century English memoirists\n20th-century English novelists\nEnglish children's writers\nCarnegie Medal in Literature winners\nEnglish conscientious objectors\nPeople educated at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys\nPeople from Chipping Barnet\nEnglish encyclopedists\nEnglish columnists"}

He is the younger brother of Renato Serafini, who also played for Fitzroy in the 1970s. From an Italian background, his parents, Carlo and Adelina hailed from Marostica, in the Veneto region of Italy.\n\nSerafini started as a full forward, kicking a goal with his first kick in League football, and a total of four on debut. However, in his second season was moved onto the wing, half back flank, and later cemented the fullback spot, when Harvey Merrigan retired. In 1983 he alternated between half back flank and full back; and was Fitzroy's top vote getter in the 1983 Brownlow Medal count. He was club vice captain 1981–1982, and a three time Victorian representative. Serafini remained involved in football after injuries caused his premature retirement, writing part time for the newly launched Sunday Age and reporting on the famous 1989 Grand Final. In 1998, he became a director at the Brisbane Lions. At the end of 1998, Serafini assisted Andrew Ireland ( CEO ) to interview Leigh Matthews as the club's next coach, leading to the 2001, 2002 and 2003 Brisbane Lions Premierships.

{"id": "17364750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent%20Markus", "title": "Kent Markus", "text": "Kent Richard Markus (born February 1, 1959) is an American attorney. He currently works as bar counsel and general counsel for the Columbus Bar Association. Before working at the CBA, he served as a Senior Advisor in the Director's Office and Director of Enforcement at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Markus served as Counselor and Chief Legal Counsel to Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and as a law professor Capital University Law School. During the administration of President Clinton, he was a senior official at the United States Department of Justice. Markus was also a federal judicial nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, though his nomination was never voted upon by the Senate.\n\n## Early life and education\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, Markus earned a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in 1981 and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1984. As a high school student, he was selected to serve as a Page of the United States House of Representatives and delayed entering college to serve as the Personal Page for Speakers Carl Albert and Tip O'Neill.\n\n## Career\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Markus returned home to Cleveland and clerked for U.S. District Judge Alvin Krenzler from 1984 to 1986. He then worked at an Ohio law firm doing plaintiff's civil rights work and representing labor unions from 1986 to 1989, while also serving as an adjunct law professor at Cleveland–Marshall College of Law from 1986 to 1988. He left to manage then-State Senator Lee Fisher's campaign for Ohio Attorney General, and subsequently served as Fisher's Chief of Staff. Two years later, Markus became the Executive Director and Chief of Staff at the Democratic National Committee before joining the United States Department of Justice in 1994.\n\nAt the Department of Justice, Markus worked as Counsel to Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick in 1994, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and Acting Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs from 1995 to 1996. He then served as Counselor to Attorney General Janet Reno and Deputy Chief of Staff from 1996 to 1998. Upon the birth of his son, he returned to Ohio where he founded the National Center for Adoption Law & Policy at Capital University Law School and taught what was at that time the nation's only regular law school class regarding the law of adoption. The Center is known, today, as the Family and Youth Law Center at Capital University Law School.\n\n## Nomination to the Sixth Circuit\n\nOn February 9, 2000, Bill Clinton nominated Markus to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to take the place of David Aldrich Nelson, who had assumed senior status. With the U.S. Senate controlled by Republicans during Clinton's second term, Markus' nomination languished. Despite Markus waging a high-profile lobbying effort to win confirmation to the Sixth Circuit seat and the fact that he had the support of both of his home-state Republican senators, no hearing was ever scheduled on his nomination by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, and no confirmation vote ever was taken by the full Senate. When George W. Bush became president in 2001, he subsequently withdrew 62 executive and judicial nominations, including that of Markus.

Inaugurated in July 2009, it has a depth of 21m. It is managed by Gangavaram Port Ltd., a special-purpose company floated by Mr. DVS Raju and cousin Mr.Datla Sreenu. Mr. DVS Raju serves as its chairman and managing director. The company is owned by the DVS Raju Group (58.1%), Adani Ports (31.5%) and the Andhra Pradesh Government (10.4%).\n\n## History\n\nConstruction of the port began in December 2005, and commercial operations commenced in August 2008. The port was formally inaugurated on 12 July 2009, by the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy.\n\nThe port is located where Borramma Gedda river joins the sea. Fishermen in the Gangavaram and Dibbapalem villages, who were directly affected by the construction of the port, demanded construction of an alternative jetty at Yarada and a relief and rehabilitation package.\n\nThe DVS Raju group invested Rs. 18.50 billion in the development of the port. Gangavaram Port Ltd. has taken a loan of Rs. 11.70 billion from a consortium of 13 banks, including the State Bank of India, to fund the Phase I development.\n\nAdani Ports announced on 3 March 2021 that it had acquired a 31.5% stake in Gangavaram Port from Windy Lakeside Investment, an affiliate of Warburg Pincus, for .\n\nAdani Ports may acquire a 58.1% stake in Gangavaram Port from DVS Raju Group, for undisclosed amount.\n\n## Comparisons with the Vizag port\n\nThe first client of the Gangavaram Port Ltd. is the Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd., which runs the Vizag Steel Plant, and earlier used the Visakhapatnam Port. The Gangavaram Port Ltd. plans to build conveyors for taking imported raw materials directly to the Vizag Steel plant, in order to reduce the railway transportation costs.\n\nThe Union Government of India, which owns the Visakhapatnam port, had proposed a joint venture between the Visakhapatnam port and the private operator of the Gangavaram port to make sure that the Visakhapatnam port's business remains unaffected. However, this proposal was rejected by the then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu.\n\nDVS Raju, while talking to reporters during the port's inauguration ceremony, insisted that it would be \"complementary in nature\" to the Visakhapatnam port, and not a competitor.\n\nThe Gangavaram port is capable of handling Super Cape size vessels of up to 200,000 DWT. The State Government plans to construct a Rs. 21-crore four-lane flyover to the Gangavaram port.\n\n## Cargo handled\n\nThe Gangavaram port handled 20.74 million tonnes of cargo during 2014-15 as against 15.81 million tonnes during the previous financial year.\n\n## External links\n\n* Official website\n\nPorts and harbours of Andhra Pradesh\nEconomy of Visakhapatnam\nTransport in Visakhapatnam\nBuildings and structures in Visakhapatnam\n2009 establishments in Andhra Pradesh\nTransport infrastructure completed in 2009\nAdani Group"}

{"id": "23591440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond%20CenterStage", "title": "Richmond CenterStage", "text": "Dominion Energy Center is a performing arts center in Richmond, Virginia that houses a number of venues including the historic Carpenter Theatre, Libby S. Gottwald Playhouse, Bob & Sally Mooney Hall, and the Genworth BrightLights Education Center. The theatre was formerly known as Richmond CenterStage. \n\nThe Carpenter Theatre was originally a Loew's Theatre movie palace developed by the Loew's Theatres company and designed by John Eberson. The building's construction began in 1927, with its doors opening in 1928.\n\n## Geography\n\nStill known to many Richmonders as the Carpenter Theatre Center for the Performing Arts, the main center stage structure occupies the 600 block of historic Grace Street, a one-way road traveling west through Richmond. In the Grace Street Commercial Historic District, it is bordered by Broad Street to the north, Seventh Street to the east, Grace Street to the south and Sixth street to the west. It is not in a City of Richmond Local Old & Historic District, but does now fall within the newly created Arts and Cultural District as designated by Richmond City Council.\n\n## History\n\nThe Loew's Theatre Corporation's design was created by renowned New York architect John Eberson and was influenced by both Spanish and Moorish baroque architecture. Architectural historian Calder Loth states: \"Loew's was considered the most up-to-date theater in the South when it opened on April 9, 1928\". Eberson was famous for inventing the \"atmospheric theatre\" design, where the theater's walls resembled an elegant villa or streetscape under a night sky. The Carpenter Theatre design evokes a Spanish setting, with a faux sky ceiling containing stars and moving clouds.\n\nThe Richmond CenterStage complex was renamed Dominion Energy Center in 2015. The Richmond CenterStage Foundation has been re-branded as Richmond Performing Arts Alliance.\n\n## Current use\n\nThe facility and organization, once known as the Carpenter Center for the Performing Arts, merged with Richmond Performing Arts Alliance (RPAA) in the early 2000s. After a major fundraising and advocacy campaign, and a private-public partnership with the City of Richmond, the Thalhimers Department Store, adjacent to the Carpenter Center, was purchased as part of the strategic plan to create the envisioned performing arts center. When construction was complete, the complex was renamed Richmond CenterStage and expanded to include the Altria Theater.\n\nThe center now contains five venues in two distinct locations. The Carpenter Theatre, named for the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation, is the historic 1,800-seat proscenium theater described above. Dorothy Pauley Square, a newer four-story building attached to the Carpenter Theatre, contains four venues: Libby S. Gottwald Playhouse, a 200-seat flexible playhouse; Bob & Sally Mooney Hall, a jazz / cabaret space; Showcase Gallery, a reception area and gallery for the visual arts; and the Genworth BrightLights Education Center, home to RPAA's BrightLights Education Intitiatives. \n\nThe third and fourth floors of Dorothy Pauley Square contain office space currently occupied by the staffs of RPAA, Richmond Symphony and Virginia Opera. The third floor also contains the Genworth BrightLights Education Center, classroom and educational space used for RPAA and other arts groups' educational programming. The Digital Arts Lab is a state-of-the-art digital media center within the Bright Lights space.\n\nCenterStage officially opened to the public on September 12, 2009, after a large capital campaign, a controversial public-private partnership with the City of Richmond, and a decision to resize the project from a much larger proposed one. Additionally controversial is the organizational structure of the complex that has SMG Richmond, a for-profit corporation based out of Pennsylvania, operating the venues via a City-appointed Board of local executives.\n\nRPAA currently has eleven Resident Companies who use the venues for performances and educational programming. City of Richmond Department of Parks and Recreation, Elegba Folklore Society, Latin Ballet of Virginia, Modlin Center for the Arts at the University of Richmond, Richmond Ballet, The Richmond Forum, Richmond Shakespeare, Richmond Symphony, SPARC (School of the Performing Arts in the Richmond Community), Virginia Opera, and Virginia Repertory Theatre. The facility has the capacity to hold smaller groups for local and regional performances, as well as very large audiences for national touring acts.\n\n## External links\n\nTheatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia\nTheatres in Richmond, Virginia\nNational Register of Historic Places in Richmond, Virginia\nTheatres completed in 1928\n1928 establishments in Virginia\nLoew's Theatres buildings and structures\nIndividually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in Virginia\nJohn Eberson buildings\nAtmospheric theatres"}

The president of the Association is Mohamed Kamal Rahmouni.\n\nATIME develops projects for the integration of Moroccan immigrants in Spain, among other programs such as housing, education and culture, etc...\n\n## Government plan, 2008\n\nThe president of ATIME defended immigrant workers in October 2008 when the Spanish government brought the new Plan of Voluntary Return into effect. Under the new plan, immigrant workers who had lost their jobs would be offered unemployment benefits as a lump sum payment, with one proviso, they agree to leave the country.\n\nOne of many immigrant associations in Spain to come out against the plan, president of ATIME Kamal Rahmouni said, \"Until recently, while the economy was booming, immigrants were the solution.\" \"Now it's as if they're saying immigrants are the problem.

{"id": "17370819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis%20Rimmer", "title": "Ellis Rimmer", "text": "Ellis Rimmer (2 January 1907 – 16 March 1965) was an English professional footballer who played for Tranmere Rovers, Sheffield Wednesday and Ipswich Town. He was a left winger who was quite tall and scored his fair share of headed goals. His career lasted from 1924 until 1939 during which time he played 447 league games, scoring 142 goals, he also played for the England national football team on four occasions.\n\n## Early days\n\nRimmer was born in Birkenhead on 2 January 1907, he played as an amateur for Parkside, Northern Nomads and Whitchurch before signing as a professional for Tranmere Rovers as a 17-year-old in 1924. In his three seasons with Tranmere, Rimmer played briefly with football legends Dixie Dean and Tom 'Pongo' Waring, making 62 league appearances and scoring 20 goals. His good form alerted other clubs and in February 1928 he was signed by Sheffield Wednesday manager Bob Brown for a fee of £3,000.\n\n## Sheffield Wednesday\n\nSheffield Wednesday were in a grave situation when Rimmer signed for them, they were seven points adrift at the foot of Division One. However Rimmer, who made his Wednesday debut on 25 February 1928 against Newcastle United, was to take part in what has gone down in Sheffield Wednesday history as the \"Great Escape\" as they picked up 17 points from a possible 20 in their last 10 matches to avoid relegation by a single point. The following two seasons saw Wednesday transformed from relegation strugglers to league winners as they lifted the Division One title in 1928–29 and 1929–30 with Rimmer a virtual ever present on the left wing. He played in Sheffield Wednesday's 2–1 defeat by Arsenal in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge in October 1930.\n\nIn April 1930 he was called up by England for his first international cap, scoring twice in a 5–2 victory over Scotland in the 1930 British Home Championship. Three other Wednesday players Bill Marsden, Alf Strange and Ernie Blenkinsop all played in that match. Rimmer played a further three international matches, his last being just before his 25th birthday in December 1931 against Spain.\n\nThe first two full seasons of the 1930s saw Rimmer net 24 and 23 goals respectively, an excellent effort for a winger whose main job was to provide chances for other players. The 1934–35 season was probably his most memorable as Wednesday lifted the FA Cup with Rimmer netting two late goals in the final against West Bromwich Albion. He scored eight FA Cup goals in total that season and achieved the rare feat of scoring in every round, only twelve players have managed this in the history of English football. He also scored 18 league goals to give him a best ever season tally of 26 and finished as Wednesday's top scorer. He continued to be a regular for Wednesday until March 1938 when Bill Fallon took his place on the left wing. In his 10-year career with Sheffield Wednesday, Rimmer played 418 games in all competitions, scoring 140 goals.\n\n## Latter career and retirement\n\nRimmer was transferred to Division Three South team Ipswich Town in August 1938, making his debut against Cardiff City on 10 September 1938. He only made four appearances for Ipswich before deciding to retire in January 1939 after playing his last match against Northampton Town in a Southern Section Cup tie.\n\nAfter retirement Rimmer ran The Hallamshire House, a public house in Sheffield and then in Formby, Merseyside. He died in Formby on 16 March 1965, aged 58.\n\n## Honours\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\n* Football League First Division winner 1928–29, 1929–30\n\n* FA Cup winner: 1935\n\n* Charity Shield winner 1935\n\n## References\n\n1907 births\nFootballers from Birkenhead\n1965 deaths\nTranmere Rovers F.C. players\nSheffield Wednesday F.C. players\nIpswich Town F.C. players\nEnglish men's footballers\nEngland men's international footballers\nMen's association football forwards\nNorthern Nomads F.C. players\n20th-century English sportsmen"}

{"id": "20522147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplysia%20punctata", "title": "Aplysia punctata", "text": "The spotted sea hare (Aplysia punctata) is a species of sea slug in the family Aplysiidae, the sea hares. It reaches a length of up to and is found in the northeast Atlantic, ranging from Greenland and Norway to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n## Life cycle\n\nSpawning occurs in the springtime beginning in May as water temperature warms and continues until around October with species tending to only live for approximately one year. Aplysia punctata are simultaneous hermaphrodites with their individual sexual role being determined by either mass or egg-laying specialization. However, they do not self-fertilize and engage in mating behavior that can involve multiple individuals. During warmer months, behavior is dominated by reproduction and feeding, with little time spent crawling or remaining sedentary. Embryos develop from laid eggs and continue to a larval stage, becoming temporary members of the plankton. Larva rapidly transform into juveniles with sexual maturity typically occurring within three and four months from birth. A. punctata are benthic gastropods found in both littoral and sublittoral habitats with a large range spanning the northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean sea. They are known to colonize both shallow, intertidal waters and also deeper zones within their range.\n\n## Feeding\n\nAplysia punctata are grazing organisms which prefer to reside and feed on algal seaweed beds. Using their radula, A. punctata tear up seaweeds in order to consume them and are found to eat up to one-third of their body weight per day of algae. Individuals of A. punctata found in the intertidal area are recorded to be larger than those in deep waters due to a comparatively larger abundance of food. However, individuals with smaller diets are thought to have lower initial mortality rates and live longer than those with unlimited diets suggesting that caloric restriction is advantageous. Feeding and sexual reproduction both take place upon algal beds which provide a source of food and protection for A. punctata. Their coloration is usually determined from the pigments in the seaweed they feed upon which in turn also provides them with camouflage. Mediterranean species of A. punctata feed primarily on red algae of the genus Laurencia which provide them with metabolites known to produce antifungals, antivirals, and cytotoxins for self defense.\n\n## Sensory organs\n\nThe rhinophores for Aplysia punctata are located both on their head and posterior tentacle. Their namesake as \"sea hares\" arises from the morphology of the rhinophores which look similar to rabbit ears. The rhinophore is the olfactory organ for the species and it is used to detect pheromones. Auditory and visual information is limited in A. punctata and so the function of the rhinophore is critical. This chemosensatory action assists in the localization of food and in sexual behavior. Amino acids are observed to be an olfactory stimulant to elicit feeding responses. Serotoninergic fibers are also found in the rhinophore nerves which are believed to have a physiological role in olfactory responses to amino acid presence. The glomeruli and the ganglion are segments of the rhinophore which represent different processing stages of sensory information; the processing of odor information takes place in the ganglion.\n\nAplysia punctata also have large neurons which make them a model species in the study of the cellular basis of learning and memory. They are known to be among the largest in nature which assists in studies that attempt to explain how neural circuits control behavior. Their increased size is attributed to being polyploid somatic cells. It is observed to be an advantageous adaptation that allows for enhanced speed of electrical signals resulting in faster behavioral response times. The central nervous system and neurons are located on the ganglionic surface and possess unique coloration depending on location.\n\n## Shell calcification\n\nAplysia punctata's shell is located internally to protect their heart and other organs from environmental conditions like wave action. However, it is comparatively thinner and smaller than ones possessed by other gastropods. Their shell is observed to measure up to 6 cm in larger specimens. Accretionary growth bands may be observed on larger specimens, akin to those seen on the shells of bivalves and other mollusks. The main element composing A. punctata's shell is aragonite that is deposited within a protein matrix. Aragonite is a form of calcium carbonate which notably is susceptible to dissolution in lower sea water pH.\n\nAs a species of mollusk, Aplysia punctata performs marine calcification in building and maintaining their shell material. This species of sea hare is unique for its shell resilience in acidified ocean environments. Most marine species with shells (mollusks, echinoderms, corals, coccolithophores, foraminiferans, calcifying algae, etc.) experience increased dissolution and increasing energetic costs of maintaining and growing these structures in this basic environment. However, living in the middle to lower intertidal zone and shallow waters, A. punctata naturally faces fluctuations in pH and has been observed to have no decrease in calcification of new shell material when exposed to acidic environments similar to those of having increased dissolved carbon dioxide. Although, they do undergo increased metabolic rate in low pH environments which is attributed to the maintenance of calcium carbonate and aragonite structures in waters depleted of these materials.\n\n## References\n\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-2.0 text from reference.\n\n* Backeljau, T.

It is probably transmitted by paradominant transmission.\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nPEODDN is defined by the characteristic presentation of numerous punctate or keratotic papules on the extremities that develop during infancy or at birth. While lesions are typically localized to the distal extremities, which are the most prevalent sites of occurrence, reports have also indicated broad involvement of the trunk, face, and proximal extremities. Plaques are frequently formed from the keratotic papules, and more advanced lesions typically disperse throughout Blaschko's lines. Although it is typically asymptomatic, moderate pruritus, hyperhidrosis, or anhidrosis may coexist with it.\n\n## Causes\n\nIt is unknown what causes PEODDN. The hypothesized pathomechanism of the entity appears to be genetic mosaicism and a possible eccrine or restricted epidermal aberration of keratinization. Recent research suggests that PEODDN is a mosaic variant of keratitis ichthyosis deafness (KID) syndrome caused by a somatic mutation in GJB2, which encodes a gap junction protein called connexin-26.\n\nPEODDN has been linked in a number of case reports to disorders such sensory polyneuropathy and hyperthyroidism, breast hypoplasia, Bowen disease, alopecia, hemiparesis, scoliosis, deafness and development delay, seizure disorder, and squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nThe foundation of diagnosis is histopathology; cornoid lamella with acrosyringia involved is pathognomonic for PEODDN. It is typically linked to eccrine duct dilatation. Differential diagnoses include inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus, porokeratosis plantaris discreta, nevus comedonicus, linear psoriasis, linear epidermal nevus, spiny keratoderma, congenital unilateral punctate porokeratosis, linear porokeratosis, and porokeratosis of Mibelli.\n\n## Treatment\n\nThere are few choices for treatment. With time, some lesions may spontaneously flatten. Surgery may be a good option for small, isolated lesions. Laser therapy is a great technique because there is very little risk of pigmentary alterations and scarring, especially when using an ultra-pulse CO2 laser. Patients with PEODDN have demonstrated considerable cosmetic improvement with combined erbium/CO2 laser therapy. Topical steroids, retinoids, phototherapy, electrocautery, keratolytics, and cryotherapy are examples of modalities that have not demonstrated any encouraging outcomes.\n\n## See also\n\n* Prominent inferior labial artery\n\n* List of cutaneous conditions\n\n## External links\n\n* DermNet\n\n* VisualDx\n\nDermal and subcutaneous growths"}

The station stopped broadcasting in May 2006.\n\nTowards the end of its tenure, the station's owners applied to the regulators for a local commercial licence, which was awarded to Brunel FM, and for a community radio licence, which went to Swindon 105.5. As a result, many of its staff and presenters moved to those rival stations.\n\n## Swindon 107FM (2001–2002)\n\nSwindon 107FM broadcast its first Restricted Service Licence (RSL) transmission from a studio at Swindon's Brunel Centre shopping complex in September 2001. The station was founded by former Swindon Town chairman Rikki Hunt and jazz musician Ray Butt, who felt a need for new station in the area where GWR FM Wiltshire had for many years been the only commercial station, along with BBC Wiltshire Sound (now BBC Radio Wiltshire). Their target audience was between 25–55 years and the station played popular artists from the 1950s to the present day that catered for their audience, including local artists with specialist music shows, which the area had been lacking, as well as a local news service.\n\nAnother RSL transmission was broadcast in June and July 2002, focusing more on local talent to present the station's programming.\n\n## Swindon FM (2003–2006)\n\nIn 2003, Swindon FM began broadcasting from new studios at Old Town Court as a DAB-only station – the first local station of its kind in the United Kingdom. Swindon FM broadcast at first on Saturdays and Sundays between 6am and 10pm before expanding to a full seven days-a-week service later in the year – an event marked by a weekend-long countdown of one hundred songs voted for by the public. Other feature programming on the station included The What's On Guide and The Winning Weekend.\n\nThe launch of a DAB station (by now, run completely by volunteers) also marked a change in Swindon FM's target audience to 35-years and over, concentrating on the older range of the scale.\n\nIn 2005, Swindon FM applied to Ofcom for a local FM licence, and at this time GWR-FM's parent company, GCap, invested in a 20% share of Swindon FM. Following a successful campaign to prove there was an audience for a second commercial radio licence for Swindon, Swindon FM ultimately lost out to another group, Now FM (who began broadcasting as Brunel FM and were owned by The Local Radio Company).\n\n## Closure\n\nAt 2pm on Friday 12 May 2006, the station ceased transmission after running into difficulties with its premises, leaving Swindon FM homeless. At the end of the year, the team behind Swindon FM applied for a Community Radio licence but lost out to Swindon 105.5.\n\n## References\n\nDefunct radio stations in the United Kingdom\nRadio stations established in 2003\nRadio stations disestablished in 2006\nRadio stations in Wiltshire"}

After serving as an Army Air Corps navigator during World War II, he was hired as news and sports director at KBOL radio in Boulder, Colorado where he studied journalism at the University of Colorado. Keene's Los Angeles broadcasting career began in 1957 at KNXT-TV (now KCBS-TV) as a weather reporter. He is credited with helping pioneer the station's hourlong news format, promoted as The Big News, which featured Keene with long time Los Angeles news anchor Jerry Dunphy and sports reporter Gil Stratton. During the same period he also reported the weather on the sister radio operation KNX (AM). Later he hosted the daytime television variety show Keene at Noon, which was retitled The Bill Keene Show when it changed time-slots to 3:30 P.M.\n\nIn 1976 Keene started working full-time at KNX where he became one of the first regular radio traffic reporters in Los Angeles.\n\nPuns were a regular feature in a Keene's traffic reports.

Novi Kodaky was founded during the reign of Bohdan Khmelnytsky as Hetman of Zaporizhian Host and was the center of the \"Kodak palanquin\" of the Zaporozhian Sich. A trade route from Poltava passed through Novi Kodak. At the end of the 19th century the area became the center of the metallurgical industry of what is now Ukraine. The colony of the Bryansk plant was formed to house factory workers. Other settlements for laborers grew together with it: Chechelivka, Shlyakhovka and Fabryka. Near the factories a railway station – Horiayinove, a secondary school for 600 people and hospital were built. In 1928, the Ilyich Palace of Culture was built, and in 1936 the building of the Industrial Technical School was built.\n\nThe current district was created in 1940 out of the city's Kodatskyi and Fabrychno-Chechelivskyi districts. In 2006, the old Cossack town of Taromske, which was located between former Dnipropetrovsk and former Dniprodzerzhynsk (now Kamianske), was merged into the district. Taromske was located on the ancient road from Kyiv to Khortytsia.\n\nUntil 26 November 2015 the district was named after Vladimir Lenin (, Leninskyi District); that day it was renamed to Novokodatskyi District to comply with decommunization laws.\n\nNovokodatskyi District did not escape the Russian aerial attacks on Dnipro (of the Russian invasion of Ukraine); in the evening of 25 October 2024 a missile attack in the district destroyed and partially destroyed two two-story buildings and two dozen apartment buildings were damaged.

No human paralogs for TMEM239 have been identified.\n\n## Expression\n\nBased on human expressed sequence tag (EST) profiles, TMEM239 appears to be expressed in the testis and the brain. According to PaxDb, the abundance of TMEM239 falls within the bottom 10% relative to all other proteins in both mice and humans. Overall, expression of TMEM239 is limited. TMEM239 appears to be expressed at moderate levels in the testes, with low expression in a variety of other tissues, including the brain and submaxillary gland.\n\n## Interactions\n\nTMEM239 protein interactions appear to be implicated in cell signaling, membrane transport and immunology. Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 Protein TAX-1 (TAX) and Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were found to interact with TMEM239 through a host-pathogen yeast two hybrid screen.\n\nAdditional TMEM239 protein interactions were identified through a human interactome mapping project. Synthenein-1 (SDCBP) is involved in the trafficking of transmembrane proteins, in addition to neuro and immunomodulation, exosome biogenesis and tumorigenesis. SDCBP is regulated by TGFB1-mediated SMAD2/3. A number of other cell signaling proteins physically associated with TMEM239, including Cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF-7), FYVE, RhoGEF and PH domain-containing protein 2 (FGD2) and Syndecan binding protein (SDCBP).\n\nThe Golgi SNAP receptor complex member 1 (GOS1) was found to associate with TMEM239. A member of the super-family of proteins called t-SNAREs, GOS1 mediates transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Lastly, the protein Alpha-N-methyltransferease (TAE1) was found to interact with TMEM239. TAE1 catalyzes the methylation of alpha-amino groups of Alanine or Serine residues in [Ala/Ser]-Pro-Lys motifs and Pro-Pro-Lys motifs. TAE1 is also responsible for methylating a number of ribosomal proteins.\n\n## Clinical significance\n\nSNP rs7360412, located in the 3’UTR of TMEM239, was identified in a genome-wide association study of quantitative phenotypes for bipolar disorder as a top marker for fractional anisotropy. In this context, fractional anisotropy, as detected by diffusion tensor imaging, was used to assess white matter integrity. White matter integrity is highly heritable and reduced in both bipolar patients and their unaffected relatives.\n\nRNA-seq was used to analyze the transcriptomes of human and Leishmania primary cutaneous lesions, in order to understand differences in host and parasitic factors influencing the progression of Localized Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (LCL) to Mucosal Leishmaniasis (ML). Decreased expression of TMEM239 in a primary cutaneous lesions indicates a higher probability of ML development.\n\n## References\n\nHuman proteins"}

The Wildcats (7–2) were in their second straight bowl game but were a fourteen-point underdog.\n\n## Game summary\n\nBad weather made the field frozen, and the weather never reached above , making efforts at getting toward the end zone nearly futile. Although Oregon State was the clear favorite, the hometown Wildcats kept the game close. The game's only score came on a 99-yard run by Baker with under ten minutes left in the first quarter. Trapped at their one-yard line after a punt, Baker was almost sacked by Al Atkinson for a safety, but he broke free, running by the sideline and sprinting toward the end zone. Despite two chances at a chance for two more points, their conversion attempt fell short, leaving it at 6–0.\n\nVillanova had a Billy Joe touchdown called back due to a penalty and had another chance intercepted by the Beaver defense. Baker went 9 of 21 passes for 123 yards and accounted for 250 of the team's 299 yards. This was the first bowl win for the Beavers since 1942 and the last bowl win for the Beavers until the 2001 Fiesta Bowl.\n\n## References\n\nLiberty\nLiberty Bowl\nOregon State Beavers football bowl games\nVillanova Wildcats football bowl games\nLiberty Bowl\nLiberty Bowl"}

Both his grandfather, George William Lailey (1782–1871) and his father William (1847–1912) were also bowl-turners, specialising in the production of bowls and plates from elm wood using a pole lathe. George Lailey was particularly noted for his exceptional skill of turning bowls in a 'nest', one inside another. After being mentioned in Henry Vollam Morton's popular 1927 book In Search of England, Lailey's work became increasingly desirable, and he began signing and dating his pieces.\n\nGeorge Lailey was unmarried, had no children to pass his skills to, and was unable to find anyone who wanted to continue his business. By the time of his death in December 1958 he had for many years been the last practitioner of his craft, and his equipment and tools were given to the University of Reading's Museum of English Rural Life.\n\n## Working techniques\n\nLailey's workshop, on Bucklebury Common, had the form of a Grubenhaus (a sunken-floored building of early mediaeval type), though it dated from the nineteenth century. He did not install an electricity supply, though one was available.\n\nLailey made a variety of items (including wooden ladles) but concentrated mainly on bowls, produced in a variety of sizes. For this, elm logs were seasoned for at least two years, sawn with a crosscut saw, and then trimmed using a side axe; the blanks were then roughly turned, stored for a further short period and finished on the lathe, applying a polish of beeswax and turmeric root. Most of the specialist tools used would have been made by Lailey himself.\n\nLailey charged a relatively modest amount for his services, although he and his father had also supplied leading London stores, including Harrods, with their work around the turn of the twentieth century, when there was a fashion for craftsman-made items. He told Morton that \"Money's only storing up trouble, I think. I like making bowls better than I like making money.\"\n\n## External links\n\n* The Bucklebury Bowl Turners\n\n* The Lailey Lathe, University of Reading\n\nBritish woodworkers\nWoodturners\n1869 births\n1958 deaths\nPeople from Bucklebury"}

{"id": "10685836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology%20of%20Bedford%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania", "title": "Geology of Bedford County, Pennsylvania", "text": "Bedford County, Pennsylvania is situated along the western border of the Ridge and Valley physiographic province, which is characterized by folded and faulted sedimentary rocks of early to middle Paleozoic age. The northwestern border of the county is approximately at the Allegheny Front, a geological boundary between the Ridge and Valley Province and the Allegheny Plateau (characterized by relatively flat-lying sedimentary rocks of late Paleozoic age). (PA Geological Survey Map 13)\n\nThe stratigraphic record of sedimentary rocks within the county spans from the Cambrian Warrior Formation to the Pennsylvanian Conemaugh Group (in the Broad Top area). No igneous or metamorphic rocks of any kind exist within the county.\n\nThe primary mountains within the county (From west to east: Wills, Evitts, Dunning, and Tussey mountains) extend from the southern border with Maryland to the northeast into Blair County, and are held up by the Silurian Tuscarora Formation, made of quartz sandstone and conglomerate. Chestnut Ridge is a broad anticline held up by the Devonian Ridgeley Member of the Old Port Formation, also made of sandstone and conglomerate. Broad Top, located north of Breezewood, is a plateau of relatively flat-lying rocks that are stratigraphically higher, and thus younger (Mississippian and Pennsylvanian), than most of the other rocks within the county (Cambrian through Devonian). Broad Top extends into Huntingdon County to the north and Fulton County to the east.\n\nThe Raystown Branch of the Juniata River is the main drainage in the northern two-thirds of the county. The river flows to the east through the mountains within the county through several water gaps caused by a group of faults trending east–west through the central part of the county. The river then turns north and flows into Raystown Lake in Huntingdon County. The southern third of the county is drained by several tributaries of the Potomac River. Both the Potomac and Juniata rivers are part of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.\n\nAll of Bedford County lies far to the south of the terminal moraine, and thus it was never glaciated (PA Geological Survey Map 59). However, during the Pleistocene epoch, or \"Ice Age,\" periglacial (meaning \"around glacier\" or simply \"cold\") processes dominated. Most of the county was most likely a tundra at that time. The many boulder fields obvious as rocky and often treeless areas on mountainsides within the county formed as a result of seasonal freeze-thaw cycles during the Pleistocene.\n\nSeveral limestone quarries exist in Bedford County, most of which are owned and operated by New Enterprise Stone & Lime Company. Quarry locations include Ashcom, New Paris (inactive), Kilcoin (closed), and Sproul (inactive).\n\nTwo coal fields exist within Bedford County. One is the Broad Top Field in the northeastern corner of the county, and the other is the Georges Creek Field along the southwestern border (PA Geological Survey Map 11). Both fields contain bituminous coal. There are abandoned mines in both areas and acid mine drainage is an environmental problem in the Broad Top area, where several fishless streams exist as a result of the discharge from the abandoned mines. \n\nNatural gas fields and storage areas exist in southeastern Bedford County, primarily within folded Devonian rocks south of Breezewood. Another deep gas field exists in the vicinity of Blue Knob on the border with Blair County to the north. (PA Geological Survey Map 10)\n\n## Interesting Features\n\nInteresting geologic features within Bedford County include some of the following:\n\n* New Enterprise New Paris quarry, where fossil corals and bryozoans may be found within the Devonian Keyser Formation.\n\n* Coral Caverns in Manns Choice.\n\n* The roadcut through Warrior Ridge on Rt. 30 (Everett Bypass), where an exposure of Silurian and Devonian rocks from limestone to shale to conglomerate can be seen.\n\n* The roadcut on the north side of the Pennsylvania Turnpike at the Narrows water gap (where the Raystown Branch cuts through Evitts Mountain) exposes a continuous section of the Reedsville Formation, Bald Eagle Formation, Juniata Formation, and the Tuscarora Formation. The beds of the Bald Eagle are overturned, folded, and faulted. The Tuscarora and Juniata are also exposed on the south side of the gap along Rt. 30.\n\n* Sweet Root Natural Area, within Buchanan State Forest and located near Chaneysville, where periglacial processes have created a bouldery landscape by eroding the Tuscarora Formation of Tussey Mountain.\n\n* Blue Knob, a notable ski resort and recreational area, is also the state's second highest point at 3146 feet/959 m (after Mount Davis in Somerset County to the west).\n\n* A transpression structure is located on the northern border of the county (shared with Blair County), about three miles east of the town of Woodbury. This structure is an up-thrust block of Cambrian and Ordovician rocks bounded on all sides by north-trending faults. The southern tip of the structure is approximately at Pulpit Hill.\n\n* An outcrop on the north side of Rt. 30 about three miles west of the village of Juniata Crossing shows an excellent example of a thrust fault within the Devonian Catskill Formation.\n\n* The Raystown Branch of the Juniata River between Breezewood and Raystown Lake to the north is an example of a river with incised (or entrenched) meanders.\n\n## See also\n\n* Bedford County\n\n* Geology of Pennsylvania\n\n## External links\n\n* Bedford County home page\n\n \nGeology of Pennsylvania"}

Predominately visiting the United States, the tour supported Simpson's third studio album, In This Skin (2003). According to the singer, the title derives from her recent success on the reality TV series, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica, while showcasing her music on a natural level. The tour began in Chula Vista in May and ended in October in West Springfield.\n\nDespite early reports of poor ticket sales, Simpson's tour became one of the biggest summer tours in North America.\n\nTo date, the tour serves as Simpson's last major concert tour. The tour ranked number 86 on Pollstar's \"Top 100 Tours 2004\", earning over seven million dollars out of 41 shows.\n\n## Background\n\nWhile promoting the re-release of her album, Simpson stated in several interviews the possibility of a tour, wanting to break away from filming her TV series and connect with her fans. The tour was officially announced in May 2004 through various media outlets, with sponsorship from Ice Breakers and Proactiv Solution.\n\nDuring an interview with the Associated Press, the singer says she wanted the concerts to focus on her music and her personality. Onstage, Simpson was joined by a seven-piece band, with no dancers or choreography for the show. Simpson would perform songs from her three current albums, while providing anecdotes about her life and the songs. Unseen footage from her reality series and variety show (entitled The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour) were included in the show as well. Each night, the singer dedicated \"I Have Loved You\" to the American armed forces and conduct a Q&A session with contest winners.\n \nBefore the tour commenced, Simpson performed at several radio-sponsored music festivals including: Your Show, Wango Tango, Summer Music Mania, Zootopia, Kiss Concert, Last Chance Summer Dance, and Play Safe in the Park.\n \nTo introduce the tour, Simpson stated:\"This is definitely a big tour for me. I'm a little nervous. It's like you're a little shaky about will I sell tickets to such a big market? […] But it's cool to put together such a huge production. And we're calling it the 'Reality Tour', from the show ['Newlyweds']. And there'll be all kinds of stuff showing never-seen clips and just kind of putting my personality into the tour, which will be a lot of fun.\"\n\n## Opening acts\n\n* Ryan Cabrera (Leg 1)\n\n* Cherie (Salt Lake City)\n\n* Shifty Shellshock (Salt Lake City)\n\n## Set list\n\n\"I Think I'm in Love with You\"\n\"A Little Bit\"\n\"Forbidden Fruit\"\n\"I Have Loved You\"\n\"She Works Hard for the Money\"\n\"Take My Breath Away\"\n\"Angels\"\n\"Be\"\n\"Everyday See You\"\n\"You Don't Have To Let Go\"\n\"My Way Home\"\n\"Loving You\"\n\"Sweetest Sin\"\n\"I Wanna Love You Forever\"\n\"Irresistible\"\nEncore\n\"With You\"\n\n## Tour dates\n\nFestivals and other miscellaneous performances\n\nThis concert was a part of \"KHTS-FM's Channel 93.3 concert\"\nThis concert was a part of \"KIIS-FM Wango Tango\"\nThis concert was a part of \"Summer Music Mania\"\nThis concert was a part of \"Z-100 Zootopia\" \nThis concert was part of \"Play Safe in the Park\" \nThis concert was a part of \"KISS-108 FM\"\nThis concert was a part of \"Summerfest\"\nThis concert was a part of \"Q Concert\"\nThis concert was a part of \"97.1 ZHT Birthday Bash\"\nThis concert was a part of the \"Orange County Fair\"\nThis concert was a part of the \"Budweiser Grandstand Concert Series\"\n\nCancellations and rescheduled shows\n\n## Broadcasts and recordings\n\nRehearsals and select performances from the tour were seen on Simpson's MTV show and her sister's show, The Ashlee Simpson Show. The show was filmed at the Universal Amphitheatre for DVD release. The DVD was released in November 2004 and omitted the performances of \"A Little Bit\", 'She Works Hard for the Money\" and \"I Wanna Love You Forever\". The set featured the music video for \"Angels\" along with a behind the scenes look at the making of the video. The DVD showed strong sales within its first week and was certified platinum by the RIAA, recognizing shipments exceeding 100,000 copies.\n\n## Critical reception\n\nOverall, the tour received mixed reviews from music critics. Many applaud Simpson's onstage persona but felt the show itself felt unfinished. Jim Farber (New York Daily News) felt Simpson's vocals during her show at the Radio City Music Hall were \"overdramatic\". He followed with, \"Not that Simpson didn't give it her all as a singer. Pulling a Mariah Carey, she belted every note to the rafters. While she clearly lacks Ms. Carey's pipes, a gross excess of amplification, and some apparently recorded vocal helper, allowed her to simulate diva-status. Too bad the songs from her three CDs all sound like pieces fished out of Britney Spears slush pile\". Dustin J. Seibert (The Cincinnati Enquirer) felt the singer's concert at the Riverbend Music Center was \"honest and warm\" He elaborates, \"Simpson's reliance on her high-octane voice and bubbly personality set her apart from some of her pop counterparts. Her shows featured no pyrotechnics or funky choreography, just her butter-melting octave range over a smooth six-piece band and two backup singers\".\n\nNeva Chonin (San Francisco Chronicle) criticized Simpson's vocal performance at the Shoreline Amphitheatre. She writes, \"A rendition of Berlin's 'Take My Breath Away', dedicated to her husband, sounded like an ode to autoerotic asphyxiation. [...] With her band successfully drowning out her tuneful but wispy vocals, Simpson led sing-alongs for anesthetized funk number 'The Sweetest Sin' and an encore of 'With You'\". Joey Guerra (Houston Chronicle) admired Simpson's personality during her performance at the Toyota Center; but felt the singer's concert was \"uneven\". He explains, \"Her material is also a bit thin to sustain a full concert. Many album tracks began to sound alike after a while, and her few certifiable hits popped up late in the evening. 'Irresistible' came at the end of the show, and the feel-good anthem 'With You' was the expected encore. Even odder was the omission of 'I Wanna Love You Forever', Simpson's breakthrough single.\"\n\n## References\n\n2004 concert tours"}
{"id": "26761624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony%20Hawtrey", "title": "Anthony Hawtrey", "text": "Anthony John Hawtrey (22 January 1909 – 18 October 1954) was an English actor and stage director. He began his acting career in 1930 and began directing by 1939. As director of the Embassy Theatre in London, several of his productions transferred to the West End. During his theatre career, Hawtrey also acted in television and on film. He was a member of the Terry family of actors.\n\n## Life and career\n\nHawtrey was born in Claygate, Surrey, the illegitimate son of the actors Sir Charles Hawtrey and Olive Morris (the daughter of Florence Terry), and was educated at Bradfield College prior to studying for the stage under Bertha Moore.\n\nFrom 1930 Hawtrey worked as an actor in London, on tour in South Africa, and with the Liverpool Repertory Company. He appeared as the King of France in the Old Vic's production of King Lear in 1931, when his cousin John Gielgud played Lear. In 1939 he was director of productions at the Embassy Theatre in north London, subsequently becoming director at the Swindon Repertory Company. Hawtrey then became the second manager of the Dundee Repertory Theatre, succeeding Robert Thornley as Director of Productions in December 1940. He opened with a Christmas adaptation of The Scarlet Pimpernel, and from 1940 to 1942 he directed and acted in over 40 plays in Dundee.\n\n## Embassy Theatre\n\nIn January 1945 Hawtrey reopened the Embassy, which had been closed due to bomb damage, and under his directorship there followed a string of successful productions. From the first two years' output, 20 plays in all, he selected six for publication, in two volumes, under the title Embassy Successes, namely\n\n* Worm's Eye View by R F Delderfield\n\n* Father Malachy's Miracle adapted by Brian Doherty from the book by Bruce Marshall\n\n* Zoo in Silesia by Richard Pollock\n\n* National Velvet by Enid Bagnold\n\n* Skipper Next to God by Jan de Hartog\n\n* No Room at the Inn by Joan Temple.\n\nOf these, Worm's Eye View and No Room at the Inn enjoyed successful transfers to the West End, at the Whitehall and Winter Garden Theatres respectively, and the plays were made into films.\n\nIn 1948 a third volume of Embassy Successes comprised\n\n* Peace Comes to Peckham by R F Delderfield\n\n* Let My People Go! by Ian Hay\n\n* Away from It All by Val Gielgud.\n\nFurther successes followed, among them the Sylvia Rayman play Women of Twilight, which proved a major hit for Hawtrey and the Embassy in 1951-52, transferring to both the Vaudeville Theatre and the Victoria Palace Theatre, and was made into a film.\n\nIntroducing the first two volumes of Embassy Successes, Hawtrey wrote: \"Our policy is this. To present new plays dealing with today's world – in terms of entertainment. If these plays are written by new playwrights, so much the better. I am aware that the English theatre cannot properly thrive unless there is a constant supply of fresh dramatists. At the Embassy, we shall always do everything in our power to foster this supply.\" Val Gielgud, in the third Embassy Successes book, praised Hawtrey's \"persistent refusal to be deterred from experiment by difficulties of staging which too frequently have proved fatal to the chances of a play's production in the West End.\" According to the actor Leslie Phillips, Hawtrey \"was a charming, easy-going man with a great sense of humour and a natural instinct for popular theatre.\"\n\n## Screen work\n\nIn parallel with his work in theatre, Hawtrey also acted in television productions and several films, a few of which were\n\n* Inquest (1939) (TV)\n\n* Warn That Man (1943)\n\n* Headline (1944)\n\n* The Hundred Pound Window (1944)\n\n* The World Owes Me a Living (1945)\n\n* Latin Quarter (1945)\n\n* The First Gentleman (1948)\n\n* Julius Caesar (1951) (TV; as Mark Antony)\n\n## Personal life\n\nHe was married to the actress Marjorie Clark, with whom he had two sons, Charles and the actor Nicholas (1932–2018). He died in London of a heart attack in 1954 at the age of 45.\n\n## External links\n\n* \n\n1909 births\n1954 deaths\nEnglish male stage actors\nEnglish theatre directors\nPeople from Claygate\nEnglish male film actors\n20th-century English male actors\nTerry family\nPeople educated at Bradfield College"}

Everything Is Fine. is a 2007 American independent drama film directed by David Brothers and Crispin Glover. It was written by and stars Steven C. Stewart. It also stars Margit Carstensen.\n\nIt Is Fine is the second in a planned trilogy of films directed by Glover (all of them under the amplificated title \"A Crispin Hellion Glover Film\"), with the other two entries being What Is It? (2005) and It Is Mine (TBA).\n\n## Synopsis\n \nA psycho-sexual, fantastical retelling of the life of a man with cerebral palsy and a fetish for girls with long hair.\n\n## Production\n\nThe film was completely funded by Crispin Glover, through his production company Volcanic Eruptions, using his salary from acting in Charlie's Angels (2000) and other films. It was written by and stars Utah writer-actor Steven C. Stewart, who also appears in What Is It? (2005). Glover and co-director and production designer David Brothers were working on an eventually unfinished project together in the late 1980's when Brothers passed Stewart's screenplay on to Glover, which the two committed to directing together with Stewart in the lead role.\n\nAlthough still in the midst of post-production of What Is It?, Glover started shooting It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine. in 2001 due to Stewart's declining health making it apparent he did not have long left to live. The film was shot intermittently over six months. Stewart died of complications from cerebral palsy only one month after principal filming wrapped.\n\nGlover has said that Stewart's script was in the style of a 1970s made-for-TV movie, and has said that \"It's an autobiographical, psychosexual, fantastical retelling of [Stewart's] point-of-view of life.\" Apart from the opening and closing scenes that were filmed in a nursing home, It is Fine. Everything is Fine! was shot entirely at David Brothers's sound stage in Salt Lake City, Utah. Glover has stated that it is \"probably the best film [he'll] ever work on in [his] entire career.\"\n\n## Release\n\nThis film premiered at the Egyptian Theater in Park City, Utah on January 23, 2007 for the Midnight screening as an official selection of the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. Glover screens the film alongside What Is It? at independent cinemas, typically accompanied by a question-and-answer session, a one-hour dramatic narration of eight different profusely illustrated books as a slideshow, and a meet-and-greet/book signing with Glover.\n\n## Reception\n \nThe film had received an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 10 reviews.\n\n## External links\n\n* Official Site\n\n* \n\n* Crispin Glover discusses It Is Fine\n\n* Article & video about Steven C.

{"id": "49301964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20R.%20Oishei", "title": "John R. Oishei", "text": "John R. Oishei (18 January 1886 – 27 January 1968) was a businessman who founded Trico products and became one of Buffalo’s wealthiest citizens and philanthropists.\n\n## Early life\n\nJohn R. Oishei was born in Buffalo in 1886 to Charles Humbert Oishei and Julia (Roffo) Oishei. Oishei's grandfather, Giuseppe \"Joseph\" Oishei, immigrated to the United States from Lombardy, Italy in 1859. By 1868, Joseph owned a saloon on Buffalo's Prime Street and by 1861, owned another saloon and restaurant on Ohio Street in Buffalo. Joseph married Adelheide Von Wildt and had three children: Charles (John's father), Aurelia and Amelia. At the time of Joseph's death in 1878, he owned the Golden Gate Hotel at 160 Exchange Street in Buffalo. Charles, aged 19, took over responsibility for the family for his deceased father and by 1890, graduated from Buffalo Law School and set up a law practice.\n\nOishei was one of eight children to Charles and Julia: John R. Oishei, Stella Oishei, Camilla Oishei, Bertha Oishei, Charles Oishei Jr., Bernard Oishei, Florence Oishei, and William Oishei. Julia died, aged 40, in 1904, and Charles remarried to Leonora Oishei and had three more children: Muriel Oishei, Harriet Oishei, and Willis Oishei.\n\n## Career\n\nIn 1916, Oishei was traveling down Delaware Avenue near Virginia Street in downtown Buffalo during a rainstorm. A bicyclist ran into the National Roadster he was driving at the time. Oishei never saw him coming, and even though the cyclist was not seriously injured, Oishei vowed to never let that happen again. He sought out the best technology available at the time to create the first automobile wiper blades and grew the idea from a simple fix to worldwide use. In 1917, John R. Oishei founded Trico Products Corporation He looked around for a way to clear moisture from a driver's line of vision, and decided to invest in the national marketing of an edged, hand-pulled rubber squeegee that was produced in Buffalo by an engineer named John Jepson. Within three years, Oishei's sales team had successfully sold the accessory to Packard, Lincoln, Cadillac and Buffalo's own Pierce-Arrow.\n\n## Buyout of Jepson\n\nThrough those sales, Oishei raised enough capital to buy out Jepson in 1919 and when World War I ended, he expanded availability of the product to Europe and beyond. Although maintaining cash flow to service early loans made Trico's initial survival a dicey proposition, its success was assured following the immediate post-World War I automotive boom. Early on, most Trico sales were the easily refitted squeegee that fit in the slot of two-piece windshields. For one-piece glass, Trico offered a spring-loaded arcing wiper that was operated by hand and pivoted across the field of vision. Although Trico did not invent the wiper motor, it did come up with a reliable unit run by an engine's manifold vacuum that quickly became the industry standard, especially in the aftermarket. Cadillac was the first to make these powered wipers standard. In 1934, that refillable wiper was redesigned to fit the new curved windshields, complete with internal springs to ensure constant pressure across the glass. Two years later, Trico introduced a powered windshield washer. In 1937, its wipers were standard across the entire U.S. auto industry.\n\nTrico eventually became one of the world's leading manufacturers of automotive windshield wiping equipment.\n\n## Personal life\n\nOishei married Estelle Low on April 21, 1908. Together, they had:\n\n* R. John Oishei (born 1910)\n\n* Julian Oishei (born 1910)\n\n* Patricia Oishei (born 1916)\nEstelle died of a heart attack on August 11, 1938.\n\nHe was a member of the Country Club of Buffalo, the Saturn Club, president of the Buffalo Club (elected in 1948) where he participated in an elite group within the Club designated the \"Society of the Buffalo.\" At his death in Buffalo in 1968, Oishei had $44 million () in stocks and bonds and approximately $1 million () in insurance policies.\n\n## The John R. Oishei Foundation\n\nIn 1940, Oishei established the Foundation, formerly known as the \"Julia R. and Estelle L. Foundation.\" He funded it with annual contributions and with charitable remainder trusts. Oishei served as President of the Foundation from its founding until his death in 1968. The Foundation concentrated its support to hospitals and schools in the Buffalo area with the balance being directed to cultural and social services needs. Until 1997, all Foundation contributions were made on an anonymous basis. This was consistent with the procedures Oishei followed with regard to the substantial charitable gifts he personally made during his lifetime. His penchant for total anonymity was driven by his strong sense of modesty and of equally strong belief that anonymity allowed him to make his philanthropic decisions with greater objectivity.\n\nAs of December 2015, the Foundation has $300 million in assets and gives away nearly $20 million annually. It is among the region’s most well-known grantmakers, providing resources for programs, capital projects and nonprofit executive development and in the last few years alone, it provided multimillion-dollar gifts to the largest health and education projects in Western New York. This includes a $10 million donation to develop the now-renamed John R. Oishei Children's Hospital.\n\n## See also\n\n* Trico\n\n* Trico Plant No. 1\n\n## External links\n\n* John R.

{"id": "15825793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt%20deflation", "title": "Debt deflation", "text": "Debt deflation is a theory that recessions and depressions are due to the overall level of debt rising in real value because of deflation, causing people to default on their consumer loans and mortgages. Bank assets fall because of the defaults and because the value of their collateral falls, leading to a surge in bank insolvencies, a reduction in lending and by extension, a reduction in spending.\n\nThe theory was developed by Irving Fisher following the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression. The debt deflation theory was familiar to John Maynard Keynes prior to Fisher's discussion of it, but he found it lacking in comparison to what would become his theory of liquidity preference. The theory, however, has enjoyed a resurgence of interest since the 1980s, both in mainstream economics and in the heterodox school of post-Keynesian economics, and has subsequently been developed by such post-Keynesian economists as Hyman Minsky and by the neo-classical mainstream economist Ben Bernanke.\n\n## Fisher's formulation (1933)\n\nIn Fisher's formulation of debt deflation, when the debt bubble bursts the following sequence of events occurs:\n\n## Rejection of previous assumptions\n\nPrior to his theory of debt deflation, Fisher had subscribed to the then-prevailing, and still mainstream, theory of general equilibrium. In order to apply this to financial markets, which involve transactions across time in the form of debt – receiving money now in exchange for something in future – he made two further assumptions:\n(A) The market must be cleared—and cleared with respect to every interval of time.\n(B) The debts must be paid. \nIn view of the Depression, he rejected equilibrium, and noted that in fact debts might not be paid, but instead defaulted on:\n\nHe further rejected the notion that over-confidence alone, rather than the resulting debt, was a significant factor in the Depression:\n\nIn the context of this quote and the development of his theory and the central role it places on debt, it is of note that Fisher was personally ruined due to his having assumed debt due to his over-confidence prior to the crash, by buying stocks on margin.\n\nOther debt deflation theories do not assume that debts must be paid, noting the role that default, bankruptcy, and foreclosure play in modern economies.\n\n## Initial mainstream interest\n\nInitially Fisher's work was largely ignored, in favor of the work of Keynes.\n\nThe following decades saw occasional mention of deflationary spirals due to debt in the mainstream, notably in The Great Crash, 1929 of John Kenneth Galbraith in 1954, and the credit cycle has occasionally been cited as a leading cause of economic cycles in the post-WWII era, as in , but private debt remained absent from mainstream macroeconomic models.\n\nJames Tobin cited Fisher as instrumental in his theory of economic instability.\n\nDebt-deflation theory has been studied since the 1930s but was largely ignored by neoclassical economists, and has only recently begun to gain popular interest, although it remains somewhat at the fringe in U.S. media.\n\n## Ben Bernanke (1995)\n\nThe lack of influence of Fisher's debt-deflation in academic economics is thus described by Ben Bernanke in :\nFisher's idea was less influential in academic circles, though, because of the counterargument that debt-deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Absent implausibly large differences in marginal spending propensities among the groups, it was suggested, pure redistributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects.\n\nBuilding on both the monetary hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz as well as the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens, which in turn leads to debtor insolvency, thus leading to lowered aggregate demand and further decline in the price level, which develops into a debt deflation spiral. According to Bernanke a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe, falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions. That in turn leads to a credit crunch that does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption, which leads to declining aggregate demand, which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.\n\n## Post-Keynesian interpretation\n\nDebt deflation has been studied and developed largely in the post-Keynesian school.\n\nThe financial instability hypothesis of Hyman Minsky, developed in the 1980s, complements Fisher's theory in providing an explanation of how credit bubbles form: the financial instability hypothesis explains how bubbles form, while debt deflation explains how they burst and the resulting economic effects. Mathematical models of debt deflation have recently been developed by post-Keynesian economist Steve Keen.\n\n## Solutions\n\nFisher viewed the solution to debt deflation as reflation – returning the price level to the level it was prior to deflation – followed by price stability, which would break the \"vicious spiral\" of debt deflation. In the absence of reflation, he predicted an end only after \"needless and cruel bankruptcy, unemployment, and starvation\", followed by \"a new boom-depression sequence\":\n\nLater commentators do not in general believe that reflation is sufficient, and primarily propose two solutions: debt relief – particularly via inflation – and fiscal stimulus.\n\nFollowing Hyman Minsky, some argue that the debts assumed at the height of the bubble simply cannot be repaid – that they are based on the assumption of rising asset prices, rather than stable asset prices: the so-called \"Ponzi units\". Such debts cannot be repaid in a stable price environment, much less a deflationary environment, and instead must either be defaulted on, forgiven, or restructured.\n\nWidespread debt relief either requires government action or individual negotiations between every debtor and creditor, and is thus politically contentious or requires much labor. A categorical method of debt relief is inflation, which reduces the real debt burden, as debts are generally nominally denominated: if wages and prices double, but debts remain the same, the debt level drops in half. The effect of inflation is more pronounced the higher the debt to GDP ratio is: at a 50% ratio, one year of 10% inflation reduces the ratio by approximately $50\\% \\times 10\\% = 5\\%,$ to 45%, while at a 300% ratio, one year of 10% inflation reduces the ratio by approximately $300\\% \\times 10\\% = 30\\%,$ to 270%. In terms of foreign exchange, particularly of sovereign debt, inflation corresponds to currency devaluation. Inflation results in a wealth transfer from creditors to debtors, since creditors are not repaid as much in real terms as was expected, and on this basis this solution is criticized and politically contentious.\n\nIn the Keynesian tradition, some suggest that the fall in aggregate demand caused by falling private debt can be compensated for, at least temporarily, by growth in public debt – \"swap private debt for government debt\", or more evocatively, a government credit bubble replacing the private credit bubble. Indeed, some argue that this is the mechanism by which Keynesian economics actually works in a depression – \"fiscal stimulus\" simply meaning growth in government debt, hence boosting aggregate demand. Given the level of government debt growth required, some proponents of debt deflation such as Steve Keen are pessimistic about these Keynesian suggestions.\n\nGiven the perceived political difficulties in debt relief and the suggested inefficacy of alternative courses of action, proponents of debt deflation are either pessimistic about solutions, expecting extended, possibly decades-long depressions, or believe that private debt relief (and related public debt relief – de facto sovereign debt repudiation) will result from an extended period of inflation.\n\n## Empirical support and modern mainstream interest\n\nSeveral studies prove that the empirical support for the validity of the debt deflation hypothesis as laid down by Fisher and Bernanke is substantial, especially against the background of the Great Depression. Empirical support for the Bernanke transmission mechanism in the post–World War II economic activity is weaker.\n\nThere was a renewal of interest in debt deflation in academia in the 1980s and 1990s, and a further renewal of interest in debt deflation due to the financial crisis of 2007–2010 and the ensuing Great Recession.\n\nIn 2008, Deepak Lal wrote, \"Bernanke has made sure that the second leg of a Fisherian debt deflation will not occur. But, past and present U.S. authorities have failed to adequately restore the balance sheets of over-leveraged banks, firms, and households.\" After the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Janet Yellen in her speech acknowledged Minsky's contribution to understanding how credit bubbles emerge, burst and lead to deflationary asset sales. She described how a process of balance sheet deleveraging ensued while consumers cut back on their spending to be able to service their debt. Similarly invoking Minsky, in 2011 Charles J. Whalen wrote, \"the global economy has recently experienced a classic Minsky crisis – one with intertwined cyclical and institutional (structural) dimensions.\"\n\nKenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart's works published since 2009 have addressed the causes of financial collapses both in recent modern times and throughout history, with a particular focus on the idea of debt overhangs.\n\n## See also\n\n* Causes of the Great Depression: Debt deflation\n\n* Benner Cycle\n\n## External links\n\n* DebtDeflation, by Steve Keen\n\nBusiness cycle theories\nMonetary economics"}

Grandson of Petras Mantigirdaitis, he first appeared in written sources in 1476 and reached his career high in the 1490s, when he was Voivode of Trakai (1490–97) and Grand Marshal of Lithuania (1491–97). \n\nChronicler Marcin Bielski described that Alexander Jagiellon was crowned and blessed as the new Grand Duke of Lithuania by the Bishop of Vilnius in 1492. Then Mantigirdaitis presented Alexander with a naked sword and a reminder that Alexander was elected to be a just ruler. In 1494, Mantigirdaitis was sent on the diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the Grand Duchy of Moscow and marriage of Helena of Moscow to Alexander to end the First Muscovite–Lithuanian War. \n\nMantigirdaitis is mentioned as the first Grand Hetman of Lithuania. The Bychowiec Chronicle describes how Grand Duke Alexander visited the ailing Mantigirdaitis in Trakai and asked for his recommendations for a successor. Mantigirdaitis recommended Konstanty Ostrogski. Mantigirdaitis is also mentioned as Hetman in a surviving copy of a donation document by Grand Duke Alexander that Vytas Jankauskas dated March 1494. If the date is correct, this would indicate that the Hetman position developed during the First Muscovite–Lithuanian War (1492–94).\n\n## Offices\n\nMantigirdaitis held the following offices:\n\n* Starosta of Braslaw (1476–82) and Lutsk (1486–89)\n\n* Marshal of Grand Duke (1480–82) and Volhynia (1487–89)\n\n* Voivode of Trakai (1490–97)\n\n* Grand Marshal of Lithuania (1491–97)\n\n* Grand Hetman of Lithuania (1494–97)\n\n## Family\n\nThere is no information available on his father, thus historians assume he died in his youth. Mantigirdaitis was married twice. His first wife was Anna, daughter of Jonas Vėževičius, regent of Smolensk. They had a son and a daughter. Their son Jonas died in the Battle of Vedrosha ending the family line. Their daughter Sophia married Stanisław Kiszka, who inherited the family's substantial wealth. Mantigirdaitis' second wife was Anna, daughter of Alexander Alšėniškis or of , son of Kaributas; they had no children. In 1482, Anna funded the Chapel of Holy Trinity in Vilnius Cathedral. It is likely that Mantigirdaitis funded the Catholic church in Iwye, his most important estate.\n\n## References\n\n1497 deaths\n15th-century Lithuanian nobility\nYear of birth unknown\nGreat Hetmans of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania\nGrand Marshals of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania\nVoivodes of Trakai"}

{"id": "18960159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni%20Pandico", "title": "Giovanni Pandico", "text": "Giovanni Pandico (born June 24, 1944) is a former Italian Camorrista who was a member of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO), a Camorra organization in Naples. Pandico rose to become one of Camorra boss, Raffaele Cutolo's underwriters within the organization. After twelve years of imprisonment, he decided to collaborate with Italian justice and subsequently became a pentito in 1983. Pandico's revelations brought a massive crackdown on the NCO and led to the arrests of over 856 NCO members and affiliates on June 17, 1983, a day labeled by the Neapolitan press as the black day of the NCO.\n\n## Early years\n\nGiovanni Pandico was born in Liveri (Naples), where his father was a lieutenant in the Italian army. Leaving Sassari shortly after the Second World War, his mother brought him to Liveri, a small town on the outskirts of Naples where his Greek grandfather had first taken up residence. During one of his first days on the witness stand, Pandico commented on his Greek roots: \"My family has Greek origins and in Greek, Pandicos means the just man.\" By the age of 15, Pandico was already familiar with juvenile hall, having spent some years inside the Filangieri, the Neapolitan juvenile detention centre. At the age of 19, he was arrested for attempting to bomb the barracks of the Carabinieri and thus incarcerated in the infamous Poggioreale prison of Naples.\n\nIt was during this period that he met prominent Camorrista and head of the NCO, Raffaele Cutolo. According to his later testimony in the courtroom, Pandico was initiated into the Camorra by Cutolo on December 8, 1963, by the classical ritual of blood baptism: a small cut on the base of the index finger of the right hand. Later, in a letter to Cutolo, he would recall the event as \"our first camorristic dawn with all our splendor\".\n\nPandico was eventually acquitted of the bombing charges and released from prison. While living in freedom, he survived on odd, low paying jobs and was occasionally sent back to the Poggioreale prison for minor offenses. During one of his prison terms, he was reunited with Giorgio Della Pietra, another native of Liveri, who was serving a 24-year prison term for murder. It was during his stay with Della Pietra that Pandico came to the conclusion that it was his own father and mother, together with the mayor of Liveri, Nicola Nappi and his brother Salvatore, who had conspired to have Della Pietra convicted of the murder of another brother of the mayor, Michele Nappi, on April 3, 1956.\n\n## Assassination attempt on Mayor Nicola Nappi\n\nPandico was inclined by this piece of information to seek revenge on the people responsible for his friend's incarceration. On June 18, 1970, two days after his release from prison, he went to city hall with the intention to kill the mayor, Nicola Nappi. In his rampage through the corridors of the city hall, he first killed Giuseppe Gaetano, a city supervisor who tried to block him. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Guido Adrianopoli, a clerk who had appeared in the corridor to see what was going on. Finally, he shot and wounded the mayor and employee, Pasquale Scola, who were both trying to find some protection in the mayor's desk.\n\nPandico was arrested the following day and immediately confessed to the crime. He stated that he wanted to get even with the mayor, the mayor's brother Salvatore, and his own mother and father who had testified in the criminal trial against his friend, Giorgio Della Pietra. But he later changed his mind and declared that Mayor Nappi had put a contract on Giuseppe Gaetano. He claimed that Gaetano was blackmailing the mayor and that Nappi arranged to be wounded in order to confuse the reconstruction of the crime and so distance himself from the murder. After a brief psychiatric examination which had cleared Pandico to stand trial, he was defined as a \"pure paranoid individual, able however to understand very well his own situation\". As a result, he was convicted of multiple murder, multiple attempted murder and lying with malice by the judges of the Corte d'Assise in Naples, and sentenced to 30 years of imprisonment, in total. He had been sentenced to three years of imprisonment for a slander charge in 1973.\n\n## Career in the NCO\n\nIn prison, Pandico increased his knowledge by voraciously reading written documents, particularly legal papers, and soon began helping other inmates in their dealing with the law. Thus, he soon developed a prodigious career in the mostly illiterate Neapolitan prison system. He was soon transferred to the prison of Porto Azzurro, where he was hired by the prison administration to help other inmates write personal letters, appeals to judges and other bureaucratic letters. Later, he was again transferred to the prison of Ascoli Piceno, which was a traditional stronghold of Raffaele Cutolo's NCO. He was moved to a cell next to Cutolo and assisted the crime boss in his daily routine, which included making coffee for him, serving food, but above all, he wrote letters on Cutolo's behalf, using a stamp with Cutolo's signature.\n\nPandico's new status of scrivano (\"writer\") coupled with his close contact and relationship with the boss greatly boosted his prestige and standing within the organization. He had now gained a reputation as a \"man of honor\". However, Pandico was increasingly at odds with the younger, more determined members of the NCO who despised him due to his arrogance and his desire to always know everything. It was only Cutolo's vested interest in Pandico that prevented any violence against him.\n\n## Becoming a ''pentito''\n\nHowever, things would later change dramatically for Giovanni Pandico when, following the scandal of the Cirillo affair, President Sandro Pertini personally intervened to have Cutolo transferred to the high security prison on the island of Asinara, Sardinia. Pandico realized that the younger leaders of the organization would never give him the respect that he wanted. After attempting unsuccessfully to improve his position by meeting with the NCO leadership, he asked the prison administration to put him in isolation. Two days later, on March 21, 1983, Pandico summoned the warden and announced his desire to defect from the NCO and cooperate with the authorities. Pandico also claimed to be a godfather and senior figure in the NCO.\n\nGiovanni Pandico's decision to become a pentito was received as a big surprise by the Italian law enforcement agencies. This was because although he had spent the past twelve years in prison, he had never come under suspiscion as being a member of the NCO. Pandico soon proved to be one of the most important pentiti to ever be involved in the Maxi Trial against the NCO. He was the second senior member of the NCO to turn informant, the first being Pasquale Barra, who realizing that Cutolo was prepared to let him be killed, decided to reveal details of NCO murders in order to gain greater protection. A week after announcing his decision, he was flown via helicopter to the Neapolitan Operative Center of the Carabinieri, where his visit was eagerly awaited by the prosecuting attorneys, Lucio Di Pietro and Felice Di Persia.\n\nIn his confession to the two district attorneys, Pandico presented himself as the betrayed man and expressed his disillusion in the organization:\n\"I intend to tell everything I know about the organization called NCO which I belonged and from which I want to dissociate myself because the rules of honor which had characterized the NCO up to now, no longer exist. A once perfect organization in which I believed, with a division of rules and hierarchies that are always respected, is now under the arbitrary will of different people who do not rely on the leaders of the organization and due to a lack of discipline go against the common interest of the organization, producing an unnecessary amount of violence and terror. I thought a great deal about it, and I have decided to talk. I want to do so in full spontaneity, having realized the uselessness of belonging to an organization devoid of all rules.\"\n\nBy this time, Pandico also held his former boss and mentor, Raffaele Cutolo, responsible for his problems and the general situation. In an open letter to Cutolo which was published in a Naples daily paper, he said: \"When you will be left alone, when all the camorristic people will have deserted you, you will take off your mask. Maybe only to breathe some fresh air. Otherwise you will end up choked by all these dead men who will scream at you: for what we have died?\".\n\nAfter more than a week of interrogation and 300 pages of deposition, Pandico was identified as a true pentito. His deposition was released to the press two months later on June, at the time of the crackdown against the NCO, as the most significant evidence behind the arrests of 200 individuals. Overall, more than 1,000 would later be indicted for the crime of association with a \"Mafia-like organization\" called \"Nuova Camorra Organizzata\". The resulting Maxi trials lasted three years and required the participation of nine different judges and scores of legal clerks, attorneys, witnesses and military policemen. Pandico was also sentenced to two years of imprisonment, for slander charges against prison staff, by the Tribunal of Livorno in 1984.\n\n## Testifying against his former colleagues\n\nFrom April 10, 1985 to April 15, 1985, Pandico took the stand and provided an unchallenged five-day testimony against his former associates and provided evidence for the crime of association in the NCO against many defendants. After his first testimony, he had come to be perceived as the most reliable of the pentiti by both the press as well as law enforcement agencies. The Italian newspapers dubbed him \"The Supercomputer\", due to his extraordinary memory and were scrambling to cover the new wealth of information that he had produced in the courtroom.\n \nOn the second day of his testimony, Pandico reminisced about the actions of one of his own Camorristic godsons, Alfredo Guarnieri. Pandico testified that during this time when he and Guarnieri had shared the same cell, the latter had asked to be admitted into the NCO. Prior to an induction, an initiate had to prove his courage by executing a sgarro, a test of personal violence needed by any member to fully become a Camorrista. Pandico agreed to this initiation and asked Guarnieri to murder his own sister-in-law, whom he deemed guilty of betraying the family honor after the death of his brother. Moreover, he wanted her head cut off in an almost surgically precise way in order to create a cover up, and put on the grave of his brother.\n\nHowever, Guarnieri did not possess the necessary skill for the operation. Therefore, Pandico decided to teach him how to decapitate a person by showing him how to behead rabbits. He brought a dozen rabbits from the prison's canteen and with a sharpened spoon demonstrated how to sever their heads. He gave the novice some rabbits to practise on and when he became completely certain that Guarnieri knew the proper decapitation techniques, he sent him to behead his sister-in-law. This murder was never accomplished. The judges, lawyers, and audience reacted to Pandico's story with a mixed reaction of interest, shock, horror and bemused curiosity.\n\nAmong his many other important revelations was the claim that Italian businessman, and former SISMI officer, Francesco Pazienza had met the failed Turkish assassin, Mehmet Ali Ağca, in his prison cell at Rome's Ascoli Piceno. This claim was also made by Ağca himself in his trial. From his New York prison, Pazienza denied ever having visited Ağca.\n\nIn the first set of trials resulting from the 1983 crackdown, Pandico's testimony along with those of many other pentiti such as Pasquale Barra, Giovanni Melluso and Luigi Riccio were found reliable and convincing enough to become a significant factor in the convictions of more than 800 defendants. However, many of Pandico's accusations were later proven to be unfounded, and several of the convicted defendants were released. In a separate trial in Salerno in which Pandico was called to testify, the prosecuting magistrate stated that \"Pandico's repentance was one of his many opportunities to show off his histrionic personality made up of mystifications, ample but void gestures, bickering accusations and lies.\"\n\n## False testimony against Enzo Tortora\n\nGiovanni Pandico was one of the eight former NCO pentiti who falsely accused the popular TV anchorman Enzo Tortora of NCO membership and cocaine trafficking. He mentioned Tortora's name while examining the lists of the members of the NCO. He claimed to have received this information directly from Raffaele Cutolo, in the course of a discussion which was supposedly carried out in the Ascoli Piceno prison during the second half of 1981. Pandico underlined that Tortora's task within the organization was that of selling the drugs and taking the money abroad.\n\nHe claimed that Tortora was mentioned accidentally while discussing a stock of drugs, when Cutolo allegedly said: \"let's not behave like Tortora\", \"the one with the parrot\". However, Cutolo would have been referring to a misdeed committed by Tortora, that is, a stock of drugs worth 50-60 million lire which he was in debt of with the organization and especially with Barbaro and Alcamo, a stock which Tortora had supposedly sold but not paid to the NCO during the years between 1977 and 1978. Tortora was detained for years before being cleared of the charge by an appeals court. He developed cancer and died soon after the case was finally solved, some say because of the emotional stress of his imprisonment.\n\n## Further reading\n\n* Jacquemet, Marco (1996).

A local businessman in the Stoke-on-Trent town of Hanley since 1991, he was selected as Labour's mayoral candidate in December 2004, defeating four others to win the nomination.\n\n## 2005 Mayoral election\n\nIn the mayoral election of 5 May 2005 Meredith polled ahead of the Conservative candidate Roger Ibbs, who was in second place, Mike Wolfe (independent), a BNP candidate and three non-aligned independents.\n\n## Time as Mayor\n\nMeredith concentrated much of his efforts on bringing the City Council's long-term financial deficits under control.\n\nIn July 2007 Meredith formed a de facto executive model for Stoke-on-Trent City Council of Mayor and Cabinet in all but name. This first move away from the Mayor and Council Manager model (the only one of its kind in England) was generally welcomed by most political groups represented on the council. The Council Executive was represented in its number from all three main political parties, Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats.\n\n## October 2008 referendum\n\nStoke's second referendum was held after the government withdrew the option of Elected Mayor and Manager as an executive arrangement. Democracy4Stoke campaigned to replace the system with a Council Leader and Cabinet model. People's Choice campaigned for an Elected Mayor and Cabinet. In the referendum, held on 23 October 2008. 21,231 voted for a council leader and cabinet, and 14,592 for an elected mayor and cabinet. The turnout was 19.23%. As a result of the referendum the position of directly elected mayor was abolished as of 5 June 2009, when Meredith's term of office ended. The City Council elected a Council Leader, Conservative Ross Irving, to replace him.\n\n## Arrest\n\nOn 6 March 2009 Meredith was arrested on suspicion of corruption in office. A Conservative Party councillor, Roger Ibbs, had been arrested a week earlier on the same charge. The police inquiry was focused on the city council's attempts to close the splash pool at Dimensions Leisure Centre, in Burslem, the previous year. He resigned all of his political positions on 8 March 2009 with the investigation ongoing.\n\nOn 7 July 2009 Staffordshire Police announced that they would proceed no further with the case, and that all charges against Ibbs were being dropped. Meredith had never been charged. There was insufficient evidence to support any case for corruption against either of the men.\n\n## Return to politics\n\nMeredith ran for election in the council ward of Birches Head and Central Forest Park, motivated by the cutbacks announced by David Cameron's central government. A dual seat ward, he topped the polls with 1,145 votes (25.92%), with unaffiliated candidate Paul Breeze also being elected.\n\n## References\n\n1965 births\nLiving people\nEnglish gay politicians\nMayors of Stoke-on-Trent\nLGBTQ mayors of places in the United Kingdom\nPeople from Shelton, Staffordshire\nLabour Party (UK) councillors\nLabour Party (UK) mayors"}

{"id": "44809554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria%20Bridge%20Abutment", "title": "Victoria Bridge Abutment", "text": "Victoria Bridge Abutment is a heritage-listed road bridge remnant at 74 Stanley Street, South Brisbane, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Alfred Barton Brady and built in 1896 by Arthur Midson. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992.\n\n## History\n\nThe Victoria Bridge Abutment is the remnant of the fourth Victoria Bridge (the second permanent bridge) to cross the Brisbane River at this point. Constructed in 1896 to a design by A B Brady, Queensland Government Architect, the bridge was constructed of iron, with stone abutments at each end. The stonework was undertaken by Arthur Midson and the ironwork by Messrs Cormick. The abutment comprises a large masonry podium supporting a section of road and a sawn stone rusticated arch with composite neoclassical ornament. A marble memorial tablet is fixed to the southern side of the arch to commemorate an eleven-year-old Greek Australian child, Hector Vasyli, who was accidentally killed on the site in 1918 while welcoming returning soldiers. The decision to retain this portion of the bridge was a combination of the desire to retain an example of the stonework associated with the earlier bridge, and as a result of consultation with the Greek Community who wished to maintain an appropriate location for the memorial plaque for Hector Vasyli.\n\nThe 1896 bridge was the fourth structure to cross the Brisbane River at this point. The first, built from timber in 1865, was closed only two years later due to excessive damage caused by marine borers. A permanent structure was commenced in 1864, but was not completed until 1874 when it was opened by the Queensland Governor who named Victoria Bridge for the ruling British sovereign, Queen Victoria. Operating as a toll bridge until 1877 it was destroyed in the February 1893 floods. A further temporary bridge was erected by September 1893 but was again destroyed by flooding in 1896. By this time, however, the second permanent bridge was nearing completion. On 30 September 1896 the \"downstream half\" of the second permanent Victoria Bridge was \"opened without ceremony\". On 22 June 1897 (Diamond Jubilee Day) the second permanent Victoria Bridge was opened for traffic, including trams.\n\nThe opening of the first permanent Victoria Bridge in 1874 provided an important transport and communications link between the north and south banks of the river and provided further impetus to the development of the south bank. In the 1880s the south bank experienced a development boom. The South Brisbane Dry Dock was opened in 1881, coal wharves at Woolloongabba and associated rail links were established in circa 1885, and South Brisbane railway station was established as the passenger terminus for suburban and country train lines built during the 1880s. Industry and commerce was attracted to the area, and Stanley Street developed into a major retail centre and thoroughfare. The spread of housing included the development of large residences located along the ridges with views of the river and industry developed along the southern bank of Milton Reach.\n\nSouth Brisbane Municipality was established in 1888. The development of the civic centre focussed on the Stanley and Vulture Street intersection and included the South Brisbane Town Hall, Post Office, Fire Station and South Brisbane railway station. A swinging span was designed to permit the passage of tall-masted ships; however even at that stage such vessels were becoming increasingly scarce and much of the up-river traffic was the lower motorised vessels. Following the introduction of tram services to South Brisbane, this \"swinging girder\" was closed permanently to permit the laying of tracks. The boom of the 1880s collapsed, following maritime and pastoral strikes in the early 1890s and the collapse of banks in 1893. A series of floods in 1893 resulted in the collapse of the Victoria Bridge which cut vital transport and communications links with the central city. Urban expansion continued following the opening of the new Victoria Bridge in 1897 and was further supported by the introduction of electric trams.\n\nThe significance of the Victoria Bridge to the commercial development of the south side of the river is best demonstrated in two anecdotes relating to human nature. At the opening of the bridge in 1897 both North and South Brisbane demanded that they have a ceremony to celebrate this significant event. The ceremony therefore required a formal opening on the north side, following which the party of dignitaries proceeded to cross the bridge to the southern bank. Here another ceremony was held and the procession then crossed the river once more to be met with refreshments on the north bank. The second story relates to a Commemoration Day prank perpetrated by university students in the early 1930s. Early one morning they installed a sign at each end of the bridge indicating that the bridge was closed to traffic. Police arriving on the scene took the signs at face value and proceeded to prevent vehicular traffic from using the bridge for most of the day. It was not until someone thought to check with the appropriate authorities that it was discovered that the signs were placed in position as a joke. As a consequence of this prank commerce on either side of the river was considerably disrupted and the university students were severely reprimanded for their actions.\n\nThe design of the bridge caused much comment, due to the impressive stone arches flanking the approaches and the manner in which the engineers had addressed the various problems presented by the site. The river banks were at two different levels, presenting a design challenge which was competently met by Brady. The gentle slope of the decking from the higher north bank down to the southern abutment was imperceptible to the eye. The cylindrical iron pillars which supported the span across the river were slightly tapered above normal water level. The metal material was \"imported from Great Britain\" and mostly (wrought and cast iron - practically everything: structure in full and superstructure all \"except the cast - steel bearings\") \"manufactured\" in situ, \"in Queensland\". As per the other construction materials - wood and stone - the bridge was built with local ones (with the only possible exception of the Oregon pine of the main girders). The builders worked at great depths under water and some suffered from the bends with one casualty.\n\nThe bridge provided a divided carriageway for traffic, with two lanes operating in each direction. The central dividing structure echoed the form of the sides of the bridge, consisting of a series of metal lattice framed hog-backs. Each end of the central divider was marked with a rusticated stone pilaster topped with an ornate gas light. The sides of the bridge were also enclosed in lattice trussing. Each end of the bridge was provided with stone pillars at the river bank and, at the point of entry, stone arches spanned the pedestrian walkways. Pedestrian footways were provided either side of the main decking. Until the 1930s the Victoria Bridge remained the only permanent crossing point between the north and south banks of the Brisbane River within Brisbane. By 1926 the bottleneck caused by the increased volume of traffic attempting to use the only river crossing in the city led to the establishment of a commission to explore alternative sites for bridges. After consideration of a number of factors such as flooding, navigation and level of demand, the William Jolly Bridge was constructed, followed by the Walter Taylor Bridge at Indooroopilly which functioned as a toll bridge from its opening in 1936. The Story Bridge was not opened until 1940 due to pressures against the construction of a down-river bridge which had the potential to limit shipping to the city wharves.\n\nIn 1918, during the celebrations marking the end of World War I and the return of the soldiers from the front, an incident occurred that touched the heart of the public and led to the provision of a memorial tablet on the southern end of the bridge. An 11-year-old child, Hector Vasyli, of Greek ancestry, was struck by one of the vehicles in the parade and killed. A marble tablet was erected to his memory and a memorial service has been held at the site on Anzac Day ever since.\n\nIn 1969 when the bridge was being demolished, to be replaced by the present structure, the memorial tablet was removed for safekeeping until a suitable location was found for it. Discussion with the Greek Community and Brisbane City Council led to the decision to retain that portion of the abutment which had originally held the memorial tablet and so it was returned to its original location on 24 April 1970. During storage the bronze relief head of the boy which decorated the tablet was lost. The Greek Consul, Mr Alex Freeleagus located the boys' sister in Sydney and she provided a photograph of the boy from which a replacement likeness was cast.\n\nThe bridge abutment was left as a ruin for some time following the demolition of the bridge, photographs taken in 1971 show that it was still in a ruined state at that time. Restoration work is reported as having been undertaken as a part of the revivification of the south bank area in preparation for the World Expo 88 which was held at South Bank Parklands. At that time two bronze plaques were attached to the side of the abutment recording the history of the bridge.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Victoria Bridge Abutment stands on the southern side of the Brisbane River downstream of the existing Victoria bridge. It consists of a large stone podium with rock-faced ashlar facing. The upriver side is faced with polygonal masonry, indicating that it is newer stonework. The podium is capped with the downstream arch of the southern abutment, together with a section of roadway which retains the tracks of the tramway.\n\nThe entry to each pedestrian footway was defined with a rusticated arch of sawn stone which combines both Classical and Egyptian vocabularies. The pylons supporting the arch are tapered towards the base of the arch from which they continue as attached pilasters with parallel sides. The arch springs from a cornice at the top of the tapered portion of the supporting pylons. Above the arch a cornice defines the base of a Doric frieze which continues around the tops of the attached pilasters. The entablature is topped with another cornice. Either side of the arch a granite tablet is applied which supports ornate metal brackets which held gas lamps to illuminate the entry to the bridge. A similar tablet is located on the sides of the structure at the same level. The three lowest courses have been treated with a \"rockfaced\" surface. The outer pylon of the arch is continued to the base of the abutment as a low profile pilaster with a rock-faced surface.\n\nAt the centre of the arch, galvanised piping projects and a section hangs parallel with the face of the structure. A marble tablet is applied to the landward side of the up-river pylon below the lowest cornice, commemorating Hector Vasyli. The tablet is in the form of an aedicule in the Corinthian style. The inscription on the entablature reads: \"EVERY LAND IS HIS NATIVE LAND TO A BRAVE MAN\"\n\nThe Corinthian columns frame a tondo beneath which the inscription continues. The tondo contains a bronze relief portrait of the boy facing outward. Below this lies the body of the inscription. The inscription reads:\n\nThe stylobate is supported on two brackets of marble.\n\nBelow the tablet two rows of metal hooks are attached to the stonework. These may be intended for the support of commemorative wreaths relating to the Anzac Day memorial services. Off centre from the entrance to the arch, a metal bollard remains in situ.\n\nUpriver from the arch a section of roadway remains, bearing sections of tramline. Between the two sets of tracks the remains of a low concrete platform with a rounded end has been left in situ. The surface to the landward side of this platform retains painted chevron markings. On the downriver side a low stone wall curves out, terminating in a low pilaster which defines the entry point for the bridge. The area is paved in bitumen. Metal brackets are attached to the stonework of the pylons, the centre of the arch and on the top of the outer pilaster; fittings for a gas illumination. Curved stone kerbing defines the footpath from the road way. The white marble memorial tablet is situated on the landward side of the up-river pylon of the arch.\n\nThe abutment is isolated from its original context as the approach road and bridge decking are no longer in place. Additional stabilising footings and retaining works have been constructed to maintain the abutment in its present location. All the stonework below the road level is done in rock-cut masonry. Other additions include a white safety railing around the perimeter which matches the railing of the neighbouring bridge, and a flight of metal and concrete stairs to permit access to the platform of the abutment. Two bronze plaques have been applied to the stonework, one at each landing of the stairway. The inscriptions show a number of inaccuracies, however are transcribed below:\n\nPlaque one - ground level \"This plaque marks the site of the southern approach to the second Victoria Bridge, completed in 1897 at a cost of £125,000 to replace the bridge destroyed by floods in 1896. When the bridge was demolished in 1969, following the completion of the present bridge, this section was retained as a memorial to the endeavour of successive generations of Brisbane's citizens to provide swift means of cross-river transport.\"\n\nPlaque two - first landing \"This stonework is all that remains of the first permanent bridge to span the Brisbane River. A temporary wooden structure was erected in 1865 as staging for the permanent bridge, but was closed to traffic from Nov 1897 as a result of flood damage. On the 15th June 1874 the new bridge was opened and named Victoria Bridge. The northern section of the Victoria Bridge collapsed on 6 February 1893 under pressure from debris during the disastrous flood of that year.\"\n\n## Heritage listing\n\nFormer Victoria Bridge Abutment was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\n\nThe Victoria Bridge Abutment stands as a memorial of the first permanent bridge to be constructed across the Brisbane River which did not succumb to the forces of nature. The opening of the bridge in 1897 provided a major boost to the continued development of the City of South Brisbane which had first received its development impetus from the introduction of cross-river transport provided by the previous bridges at this location.\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.\n\nThe manner of the design reflects the aesthetic values of Brisbane's early public structures and provides information regarding the manner in which the engineering challenges of the site were addressed.\n\nThe place is important because of its aesthetic significance.\n\nThe manner of the design reflects the aesthetic values of Brisbane's early public structures and provides information regarding the manner in which the engineering challenges of the site were addressed.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe Victoria Bridge Abutment has a high social value for the Greek community of Brisbane, containing as it does, the memorial to Hector Vasyli, a young Greek Australian boy who died while demonstrating his loyalty to his adopted homeland. This association is further demonstrated by the role of the Greek community in ensuring that this portion of the bridge was retained to provide a fitting location for the memorial plaque erected in the memory of the Vasyli boy and the continued practice of conducting a memorial service for the boy each Anzac Day.\n\nThe place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.\n\nThe elegance of this remaining portion serves as a reminder of the grace and style of the substantial structure designed by A B Brady, Government Architect.\n\n## Attribution\n\nQueensland Heritage Register\nSouth Brisbane, Queensland\nBridges in Brisbane\nArticles incorporating text from the Queensland Heritage Register\n1896 establishments in Australia"}
{"id": "56607530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Tudor%20Jones", "title": "John Tudor Jones", "text": "John Tudor Jones , also known as John Eilian (29 December 1903 – 9 March 1985) was a Welsh journalist, poet (chaired and crowned at the National Eisteddfod of Wales), literary scholar, broadcaster, and translator into Welsh of many classical songs and children's books.\n\nHe dedicated his working life to the Welsh language, literature, culture and history. He believed, among other things, that \"the Welsh language is the most British thing in Britain, spoken from the Firth of Clyde (Clwyd), through Cumbria (Cymru) to Dover (dwfr), before the English came in, and taken over the Channel to Brittany by emigrants\" and that Welshness would survive better, as it had done for centuries, within the structure of Britain, rather than by imposing on itself an English-style \"home rule\" based on a culturally and historically arbitrary boundary. He played a major part in championing the concept of Gwynedd \"as part of the national unity of Britain\".\n\n## Early life\n\nJohn Eilian was born in the parish of Llaneilian, Anglesey, on 29 December 1903 and was bought up by his mother, Annie Jones. He was registered as John Thomas Jones but, in the 1930s, changed his middle name by deed poll to \"Tudor\". He was christened in Llaneilian church in 1914, and it was then that he began to play the organ, and music (as well as the Church in Wales) became an important part of his life. His primary school was Penysarn Council School. His secondary school\nwas the County School in Llangefni, where he learnt English; he often spoke about the gratitude he owed to the headmaster, Samuel James Evans, who developed his thorough bilingualism. He spent one year at Aberystwyth University where he learnt his bardic craft from T. Gwynn Jones and T. H. Parry-Williams. He then went to Jesus College, Oxford: almost certainly due to lack of financial support – he and his sister, May, were brought up by a single mother, who, at the same time, cared for her disabled brother – he did not complete his studies there either, leaving during his first year. As a 19-year-old in 1923, he published (with E. Prosser Rhys) a somewhat controversial and risqué but well-received book\nof poems entitled Gwaed Ifanc. In September 1924, having established himself as a radical thinker, he was invited by the Honorary Secretary of the Llangefni Labour Party to have his name put forward as the Parliamentary candidate for the Anglesey constituency. His career as a journalist began at the Western Mail in 1924.\n\n## Journalism in the Middle East\n\nIn 1927, John Eilian took up a post as editor of the Times of Mesopotamia, and was married in Basrah on 4 October 1927 to Lilian Maud Powell, a Welsh scholar. From 1927 to 1929 he was the Iraq Correspondent of the London Times. He also published regularly in the Daily Mail. During this spell, he had some interesting\nexperiences in the Arabian Desert at the time when King Ibn Saud's followers were raiding the borders of Iraq and threatening Holy War. After returning from Mesopotamia, he joined\nthe Daily Mail in Fleet Street.\n\n## ''Y Ford Gron'' (1930–1935)\n\nThe idea of establishing Y Ford Gron was inspired by a conversation with Sir David Hughes Parry, lawyer and son-in-law of Sir Owen M. Edwards, who was somewhat disheartened by the state of Welsh periodicals. John Eilian and his wife decided to address this by launching their own journal – modern in style, wide in its appeal – and seeing what happened. To this end, they rented a small room, next door to the Daily Mail HQ, in Fetter Lane. They realised that, for the venture to succeed, things had to be run professionally. They decided that Hughes a’i Fab in Wrexham was the only publishing company with the equipment and experience to meet the task; also, Rowland Thomas, the owner, had great ambitions. Then they wrote many letters to friends and contacts all over Wales with a view to generating interest.\n\nThe material was produced in London and sent to Wrexham for publication. The first Y Ford Gron – Papur Cymru’r Byd('The Round Table – a Paper for the Welshmen of the World') appeared in November 1930, at 6d per copy. With a circulation of 13,000, Hughes a'i Fab were delighted, but the workload was unsustainable. Rowland Thomas saw his opportunity, bought Y Ford Gron, and appointed John Eilian editor, and also publisher for Hughes a'i Fab. It was at this time that he was joined by the journalist Percy Ogwen Jones.\n\nY Ford Gron continued monthly for 5 years until October 1935 – the \"golden years of the history of the Welsh press\", according to Bedwyr Lewis Jones. Many leading figures of the day wrote to John Eilian during this period; their letters are in his archive at the National Library of Wales.\n\n## ''Y Cymro''\n\nIn 1932, John Eilian became the founding editor of Y Cymro, the first-ever newspaper in Welsh for the whole of Wales. However, the paper did not really match the success of Y Ford Gron and Rowland Thomas decided to rationalise the situation by dropping the latter. This caused a rift and in 1935 John Eilian resigned from Hughes a’i Fab. Y Cymro was a significant part of John Eilian's legacy to Welsh culture (another \"miracle\" in the view of John Roberts Williams) and it continued until 2017.\n\n## The Ceylon period (1935–1937)\n\nIn 1935, John Eilian went abroad once again, this time to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where he was the editor of The Times of Ceylon. His interest in broadcasting may have stemmed from his involvement in establishing Ceylon's first commercial radio station.\n\nOn 26 October 1936 (and again in 1961), the BBC Regional Programme broadcast a one-act play called ‘The Silver Coin’ by Arthur O. Roberts, translated into Welsh by John Eilian. On 6 June 1937, the BBC broadcast a programme by John Eilian on Colombo.\n\nDuring this period, he maintained his involvement in Welsh cultural life and journalism. In June–July 1937 he published four linked articles in Y Cymro on prominent Welshmen: T. Gwynn Jones, W. J. Gruffydd, R. Williams Parry, and Saunders Lewis. Here we begin to see that John Eilian has developed a view of Welsh culture and history as an integral and important part of the history of Britain as a whole, and not something about which Welsh people should get nationalistic. (Later, he would be described in The South Wales Voice as \"not a Welsh Nationalist but [...] no less a Welsh patriot\".) Before returning to Britain, John Eilian spent short periods with The Macedonian Times and The Iraq Times.\n\n## Broadcasting and journalism from 1938\n\nIn 1938, John Eilian was appointed BBC Welsh Programme Director, a post he held for 18 months until the outbreak of war. One notable achievement of this period was that he persuaded his London colleagues to broadcast for the first time the famous song, \"We’ll keep a welcome in the hillsides\", on 24 September\n1940. Then, in April 1940, John Eilian was appointed Chief Editor of the BBC Monitoring Service:\n\nThis is the new organisation which keeps a constant watch on the propaganda and news broadcast by enemy and neutral countries and prepares a comprehensive daily summary for official use. Started when the war began, the monitoring service now has a staff of over 200 dealing with broadcasts in more than 20 languages.\n\nDuring the war period, John Eilian contributed regularly to Y Cymro under the nom-de-plume of Robin Bwrgwyn (Robin of\nBurgundy): the articles challenged the anti-British position championed by Saunders Lewis in Y Faner. He continued at the BBC until 1948 when he returned to Wales.\n\nIn 1951, John Eilian published a long article in Y Llenor entitled \"Y BBC a Chenedl y Cymru\" ('The BBC and the Welsh Nation'). In it, after 11 years at the BBC, he reflects on its state as an institution and discusses the opportunities possible for developing \"quality\" broadcasting in Welsh, as well as the dangers of settling for mediocracy.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1981, he was managing editor of the Caernarvon Herald group of weekly newspapers. During this period, John Eilian was also a prolific contributor to both radio and TV programmes. In particular, from 8 January 1960 until 27 May 1960 John Eilian chaired a series of 20 current affairs discussion programmes called Pawb a'i Farn on TWW (Television Wales and the West). Later that year, the\nBBC ran a series of four programmes on famous politicians (including Fidel Castro, David Ben-Gurion and Konrad Adenauer), broadcast throughout the UK, called Y Byd yn eu Dwylo ('The World in their Hands'); these were discussions by distinguished panels, chaired by John Eilian.\n\nIn January 1961 the BBC produced a television version of Y Darn Arian, Jones's translation of the play first broadcast on radio in 1936.\n\n## Poetry\n\nApart from Gwaed Ifanc, John Eilian had many poetic works published in newspapers, books and journals (particularly\nY Llenor), over the decades. The highlight of his poetic career was becoming one of a few poets to win both chair (1947) and crown (1949) at the National Eisteddfod of Wales. The poem for which he was awarded the latter, \"Meirionnydd\" has been described on a BBC website as one of the best chair-winning poems of the\nNational Eisteddfod, and excerpts from it are included in the Oxford Book of Welsh Verse.\n\n## Literary scholarship\n\nIn 1931, John Eilian produced a highly acclaimed series of booklets called Llyfrau’r Ford Gron, on the \"greats\" of Welsh literature and poetry. Also, throughout his career, he published widely in journals on a variety of topics.\n\n## Translation\n\nJohn Eilian translated (or composed) over 80 songs that were published by W. S. Gwynn Williams, ranging from classical works such as Handel's Judas Maccabaeus to folk songs such as\n\"Hey ho, to the greenwood\" by William Byrd. He also translated many children's books into Welsh.\n\n## Politics\n\nDespite having been a strong Labour supporter in his youth, John Eilian ended up standing as a Conservative candidate for the Ynys Môn (Anglesey) constituency in the 1964, 1966 and 1970 General Elections.\nHe was very much on the Macmillanite (left) side of the Party and anti-Thatcher. He was a more of a Unionist than a Tory, believing that Wales, its language and culture, would fare better within the United Kingdom – where, as he saw it, it belonged and had thrived historically – rather than by adopting \"home rule\", and mimicking an English style of politics.\n\n## Honours\n\nIn 1964 John Eilian was awarded an OBE for \"services to journalism\" and, in 1974, he was elected a member of the Royal Commission on the Press, representing provincial papers. In 2004, a commemorative plaque was erected on his Anglesey childhood home, Penlan, Penysarn.\n\n## References\n\nWelsh broadcasters\n20th-century Welsh writers\n1903 births\n1985 deaths"}

{"id": "6941258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music%20conservatories%20of%20Naples", "title": "Music conservatories of Naples", "text": "This is a list of music conservatories in Naples, Italy.\n\n## Conservatorio di San Pietro a Majella\n\nThe Naples Conservatory of Music is a music school located in Naples, Italy. It is situated in the complex of San Pietro a Majella.\n\nIt was originally located in the church of the former monastery of San Sebastiano and was called the Conservatorio di San Sebastiano, formed in 1807 by the merger of the Conservatorio di Santa Maria di Loreto, the Conservatorio di Sant' Onofrio in Capuana, and the Conservatorio della Pietà dei Turchini. It also became known as the Real Collegio di Musica, and after 1826 when it moved to its current location, as the Conservatorio di Musica San Pietro a Majella. \nThe conservatory and adjacent church are today part of the old San Pietro a Majella monastic complex, built at the end of the 13th century and dedicated to the monk Pietro da Morone, who became Pope Celestine V in 1294. The conservatory houses an impressive library of manuscripts pertaining to the lives and musical production of composers who lived and worked in Naples, among whom are Alessandro Scarlatti, Pergolesi, Vincenzo Battista, Domenico Cimarosa, Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti. Vittorio Monti, who around 1904 composed the famous Csárdás, studied violin and composition at this conservatory. Another student was Leonardo De Lorenzo, flautist of many American orchestras and teacher at the Eastman School of Music. The historical museum has a display of rare antique musical instruments.\n\n## The historic conservatories\n\nSan Pietro a Majella is the last in a long string of establishments that have been music conservatories in Naples. Their existence goes back to the Spanish rule of the city as a vicerealm starting in the early 16th century. These early conservatories were Santa Maria di Loreto, Pietà dei Turchini, Sant'Onofrio a Capuana, and I Poveri di Gesù Cristo. They enjoyed a considerable reputation as training grounds not only for young children to be trained in church music, but, eventually, as a feeder system into the world of commercial music once that opened up in the early 17th century.\n\n## Conservatorio di Santa Maria di Loreto\n\nSanta Maria di Loreto was built in 1535 and was the original conservatory in Naples, coming at the beginning of the Spanish expansion of Naples under the city's most famous viceroy, don Pedro de Toledo. It is the first secular music conservatory. Alumni include Salvatore Lanzetti and Domenico Cimarosa. Old maps show Santa Maria di Loreto to have been a seafront \"borgo\" —a separate section of town. Thus, the conservatory was beyond the Spanish fortifications that guarded the southeastern approach to Naples.\n\n## Conservatorio di Sant'Onofrio a Capuana\n\nSant'Onofrio a Capuana dates from 1578 and counts as its alumni Niccoló Jommelli, Giovanni Paisiello, Niccolò Piccinni, and Antonio Sacchini, four of the great names in the 18th century Neapolitan music. The Italian Baroque composer Cristofaro Caresana was a director from 1667 until 1690. The original building still stands, just across the street on the north side of the old Vicaria, the tribunale, the Naples Hall of Justice.\n\n## Conservatorio della Pietà dei Turchini\n\nThe building of the Conservatorio della Pietà dei Turchini, built in 1583, still stands on via Medina, near city hall. The Church of Pietà dei Turchini, still consecrated has a plaque explaining the role of the conservatory among the major four. The name \"conservatory\" originally indicated a place that \"conserved\" orphans and young women. All of the institutions instructed their wards in music; thus was born the modern meaning of \"music school. By the 19th century however, most of the pupils of the conservatory were not orphans.\n\nEvidence of the productivity of this conservatory is that among its pupils were: Giovanni Salvatore, Francesco Provenzale, Gaetano Greco, Nicola Fago, Carmine Giordani, Michele de Falco, Leonardo Leo, Giuseppe de Majo, Lorenzo Fago (Son of Nicola Fago) (1704–1793), Nicola Sala, Niccolo Jommelli, Girolamo Abos, Pasquale Cafaro, Pasquale Errichelli, Giacomo Tritto, Ferdinando Orlandi, Gaspare Spontini, Giuseppe Farinelli, and Luigi Lablache. \n\nTeachers of this Conservatory, some of whom had been pupils listed above, included: Giovanni Maria Sabino, Erasmo di Bartolo, Giovanni Salvatore, Francesco Provenzale (1624–1704), Cristoforo Caresana, Gennaro Ursino, Nicola Fago (1677–1745), Lorenzo Fago (1704–1793), Nicola Sala (1713–1801), Girolamo Abos (1715–1760), Pasquale Cafaro (1716–1787), and Giacomo Tritto (1733–1824).\n\n## Conservatorio dei Poveri di Gesù Cristo\n\nThe Conservatorio dei Poveri di Gesù Cristo was founded in 1589 by Marcello Fossataro, a Franciscan friar. It was adjacent to the church of Santa Maria a Colonna on via dei Tribunale. Illustrious names connected with the school include the philosopher Giovan Battista Vico; a \"maestro de [sic] grammatica\" from 1620 to 1627. Musical luminaries at the conservatory included Francesco Durante, Gaetano Greco, Nicola Porpora, Leonardo Vinci and Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. This conservatory was suppressed in November 1743 and converted into an establishment of the archiepiscopal seminary.\n\n## Conservatorio di San Sebastiano\n\nIn 1806, with Napoleon Bonaparte's brother, Joseph, installed as the king of Naples in what would be a decade of French rule of the kingdom, monastic life in the kingdom was drastically reorganized and the three surviving monastery music schools were consolidated into a single building, the Church of San Sebastiano, not far from the modern conservatory. Finally, in 1826 that consolidated conservatory was moved to the present site.\n\n## References\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n* Di Benedetto, Renato; Fabris, Dinko (2001). \"Naples. 3: The Spanish era (1503–1734).

{"id": "63976948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afanasy%20Gryaznov", "title": "Afanasy Gryaznov", "text": "Afanasy Sergeyevich Gryaznov (; 8 July 1899 – 11 September 1969) was a Soviet Army major general.\n\nGryaznov joined the Red Army during the Russian Civil War and rose to junior command positions after its end. Holding command and staff positions in the Leningrad Military District during the 1920s and 1930s, he was studying at the Military Academy of the General Staff when Operation Barbarossa began. Gryaznov commanded the 64th Rifle Division (which became the 7th Guards) in the first months of the war and rose to lead the 1st Guards Rifle Corps in the Demyansk Offensive, but was relieved when the Soviet efforts in the latter failed. After commanding the 14th Guards Rifle Division from mid-1942, Gryaznov held a succession of corps commands during the rest of the war. His career ended in the early 1950s after serving as a professor at the Military Academy of the General Staff for several years.\n\n## Early life and Russian Civil War\n\nGryaznov was born on 8 July 1899 in the village of Slastukha, Saratov Governorate. He worked as an apprentice mechanic and master's assistant in the rail depot at Petrovsk-Port station. After the Russian Revolution, he joined the depot worker's militia in October 1917, before returning to his homeland, where he joined the Red Guard volunteer detachment of Akifyev in February 1918 as an ordinary soldier. With the detachment, he fought in battles against the Czechoslovak Legion at Serdobsk and Penza. From July, with the Red Guard detachment of Kurgayev, he fought against the Don Army in the area of Povorino. \n\nGryaznov was hospitalized in his homeland between January and June 1919, and upon recovery in the latter month was sent to the Red Army, serving as a Red Army man in the separate plastun (foot) cavalry battalion of the Southern Army Group of the Eastern Front, which was merged into the Lower Ural Regiment of the 22nd Rifle Division. With the latter, he fought on the Uralsk front before his unit was shifted to the Southern Front in July. Sent to study at the Sanitary School of the sanitary (medical) units of the Southeastern Front in Saratov in September 1919, he became a nurse at the Alexandrovsky Military Hospital of the front in February 1920 upon the completion of his training. In July 1920 he was sent to study at the 1st Soviet Moscow Machine Gun Courses, which were renamed the 1st Soviet Combined Military School in 1921. That year, he participated in the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion when the school sent a detachment to the front.\n\n## Interwar period\n\nUpon his graduation from the school in October 1922, Gryaznov was sent to serve as a platoon commander in the 2nd Militsiya Regiment of the Petrograd Separate Brigade, which in 1923 was renamed the Petrograd Militsiya Rifle Division. From March 1923 he served with the 59th Rifle Regiment of the 20th Rifle Division (formed from the Petrograd Division) as an assistant chief of weapons in a machine gun detachment and platoon commander. Gryaznov transferred to serve as a platoon commander in the Separate Kuzhenkovsky Guard Battalion of the Leningrad Military District in November 1924, and in January 1926 was again transferred, this time to the 33rd Rifle Regiment of the 11th Rifle Division. With the latter, he served as a platoon commander and assistant company commander, studying at the Leningrad Military-Political Courses from October 1927.\n\nGryaznov became a company political officer and company commander in the 10th Turkestan Rifle Regiment of the 4th Turkestan Rifle Division after completing the course in August 1928. He was sent to the Frunze Military Academy for advanced training in September 1931, and upon his graduation in May 1936 was appointed chief of staff of the 6th Caucasian Rifle Regiment of the 2nd Caucasian Rifle Division, stationed in the Kiev Military District. The regiment was soon renumbered as the 176th Rifle Regiment when the division became the 60th Rifle Division. In September 1937 he became an assistant section chief of the 1st department of the district staff, before entering the Military Academy of the General Staff in October 1938. In October 1939 Gryaznov was appointed chief of staff of the 67th Rifle Division (the former 20th) and with it participated in the occupation of the Baltic States. He returned to the academy in October 1940 to continue the second year of his studies there.\n\n## World War II\n\nAfter Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, Gryaznov was released from the academy and appointed officer for errands under the Western Front commander-in-chief, Marshal Semyon Timoshenko. He became commander of the 64th Rifle Division on 15 July, which he led as part of the 44th Rifle Corps in fighting near Yartsevo during the Battle of Smolensk. For its \"courage in battle,\" the division became the 7th Guards Rifle Division, and Gryaznov commanded the latter in the Battle of Moscow as part of the 49th and 16th Armies of the front. Serving as commander of the 1st Guards Rifle Corps from 2 January 1942, he was promoted to major general eight days later. Gryaznov led the corps in the Demyansk Offensive against the German troops in the Demyansk Pocket as part of the Northwestern Front, but was relieved of command on 22 May 1942 after his corps failed to destroy the encircled forces.\n\nAfter a month awaiting assignment, Gryaznov became commander of the 14th Guards Rifle Division on 23 June. Between August and October 1942 he led the division as part of the 63rd Army in the defensive phase of the Battle of Stalingrad. The division subsequently fought in Operation Uranus and Operation Little Saturn as part of the 21st Army and the 1st and 3rd Guards Armies of the Southwestern Front during late 1942 and early 1943. After serving temporarily commanding the 14th Rifle Corps from 24 December, Gryaznov was appointed commander of the 15th Rifle Corps on 15 January 1943. He led it as part of the 6th Army of the Southwestern Front in Operation Gallop, during which it captured Kupyansk and Balakleya. Injured in a car accident on 28 March, he was evacuated to a hospital in Moscow.\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries, Gryaznov was appointed commander of the 47th Rifle Corps on 25 June 1943. He led it as part of the 40th Army of the Voronezh Front in the Battle of Kursk and the Belgorod–Kharkov Offensive. Hospitalized due to illness between 18 September and 9 November, Gryaznov was placed at the disposal of the Personnel Directorate after recovering. He became commander of the 99th Rifle Corps, part of the 21st Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, on 20 December. In April, the corps was sent to the Leningrad Front with the army, and on the 15th of that month Gryaznov was transferred to command the 110th Rifle Corps, which he commanded for the rest of the war. The corps fought in the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive, the Baltic Offensive, and the blockade of the Courland Pocket. He was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, for his leadership of the corps in the Riga Offensive. In the recommendation for the award, his superior, 42nd Army commander Vladimir Sviridov, wrote that Gryaznov \"fulfilled the assigned objectives with few casualties\".\n\n## Postwar\n\nAfter the end of the war, Gryaznov continued to command the corps, which was relocated to the Odessa Military District in August 1945. In October he became commander of the 82nd Rifle Corps of the district, and in May 1946 was appointed a senior professor at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy (the former Military Academy of the General Staff). This would be his last post, as he was transferred to the reserve on 11 January 1954. Gryaznov lived in Moscow, where he died on 11 September 1969.\n\n## Awards and honors\n\nGryaznov was a recipient of the following awards and decorations:\n\n* Order of Lenin\n\n* Order of the Red Banner (5)\n\n* Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n1899 births\n1969 deaths\nPeople from Saratov Oblast\nPeople from Atkarsky Uyezd\nCommunist Party of the Soviet Union members\nSoviet major generals\nFrunze Military Academy alumni\nSoviet military personnel of the Russian Civil War\nSoviet military personnel of World War II\nMilitary Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union alumni\nRecipients of the Order of Lenin\nRecipients of the Order of the Red Banner\nRecipients of the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class"}

It provides drinking water to almost 200,000 people, irrigates about of olives, fruit trees and agricultural crops, and supplies 25 MW of hydroelectric power. It is currently under the control of the Turkish Land Forces.\n\n## Location\n\nThe dam is north of the town of Afrin in northwest Syria.\nIt is from the city of Aleppo and from the town of Afrin, near the village of Midaneka (Maydanki).\nA large part of the region is planted with olive and fruit trees. \nAbout 80% of the area depends on rainwater irrigation, and the remainder on wells and pumps.\nBefore the dam was built, the orchards and other crops were irrigated, but the olive trees were not.\nThe Afrin District is populated by Kurds, the furthest west of the Syrian Kurdish regions.\n\nThe catchment area is , with annual rainfall of . The Afrin River originates in the south of the Kartal Mountains in Turkey, crosses into Syria where it runs through the city of Afrin, and then crosses back into Turkey. About of the annual flow of the river comes from the Hatay Province of Turkey, while about originates in Syria.\n\n## History\n\nThe dam was intended to irrigate land in the river valley in the region between Aleppo and the border with Turkey.\nThe project was approved in 1984 after extensive studies by the Ministry of Irrigation.\nThe dam would control the river flow and prevent flooding, irrigate up to of land, supply drinking water in the region, provide up to 20 MW of hydroelectric power and would become a tourist attraction.\n\nConstruction began in 1997. The dam was built for the General Water Resources Authority at a total cost of LS 58.2 billion, including the cost of land acquisition for the reservoir. of earth and rock was excavated during construction. The dam was inaugurated on 24 April 2004 in the presence of Prime Minister Muhammad Naji al-Otari. Syrian state resolution No. 1849 of 2004 declared that the 17 April Dam Lake was a protected area.\n\nA 2016 report noted that water usage appeared to have dropped due to the Syrian Civil War. On 9 March 2018, during Operation Olive Branch, armed units belonging to the Syrian National Army rebel faction and the Turkish Armed Forces seized control of the dam, capturing it from the Kurdish-majority People's Protection Units (YPG).\n\nOn 13 January 2019, body filling, water intake structure, reinforced concrete and mechanical cover systems were completed and repaired by the Turkish State Hydraulic Works (DSI), who renamed it the Upper Afrin Dam.\n\nAfter the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake, the Afrin Dam suffered damage, with visible cracks on its surface, raising concerns that the dam could collapse.

The half-fan spillway has capacity of .\n\nA tunnel with a diameter of and length of provides for emergency discharge. Another tunnel, with a diameter of and length of . is used to discharge drinking and irrigation water. There are also wells and tunnels for inspection and drainage of water infiltrating the dam. An innovative network of electrical measurement devices is installed in the body of the dam and the different facilities, including those for measuring temperature and seismic activity. The hydroelectric plant provides 25 MW of power.\n\n## Reservoir\n\nThe reservoir has a capacity of . It is long, and wide in the center section. It covers an area of . The maximum flow is . The irrigated area is in the Afrin district. Irrigation plans are 52% olive trees, 11% fruit trees, 31% crops such as wheat, barley, beets, watermelons and cotton, and 6% other vegetables.

The town was disbanded in the 1950s with the flooding of Lake Sakakawea and for a very short period of time was classified as a ghost town in the north central United States, located in Van Hook Township in Mountrail County, North Dakota. The original town site was mostly left not flooded when Lake Sakakawea was formed in the 1950s behind Garrison Dam.\n\nThe US Government forced all Van Hook residents in the 1950s to give up their homes and move to New Town. The townsite for a short period of time was abandoned. However, since most of the old townsite was never actually flooded by Lake Sakakawea, the townsite and land nearby more recently has been turned into a thriving unincorporated resort community still called Van Hook and with both a summer-only and a year-around permanent population. Lake Sakakawea's Van Hook Arm gets its name from the town.\n\n## History\n\nVan Hook was founded in 1914 as a station on the Soo Line Railroad. It is named after Fred van Hook, who was one of the first to survey the area in 1911. It was incorporated in 1915, and reported a population of 372 in 1930. In fact, the town grew so fast that it earned the nickname \"The City of Speed.\"\n\nWhen the Garrison Dam was built in the early 1950s, forming Lake Sakakawea, the town's original residents were relocated to New Town, which the government had built to house those displaced by the dam. Residents from Sanish, located in a place which is now usually completely underwater, also moved here. Another new unincorporated village called New Sanish has since reformed on higher dry land to the south of the original flooded Sanish townsite but still near Lake Sakakawea.\n\nThe original incorporated Van Hook town's last reported US Census population in 1950 was 380, prior to when, everyone was forced to move out by the federal government.\n\nThe Van Hook arm of Lake Sakakawea has always been very popular for recreational fishing, boating, and camping. The rebuilt resort town began a building process in the 1970s when it became obvious that most of the main townsite did not flood and would never be flooded by the waters of Lake Sakakawea, and some of the original townsite area was initially opened for camping trailers and other similar temporary summer living quarters. This begins a sequence of events in which year-round homes were eventually not only permitted but encouraged—leading eventually to the present town and the year-round Van Hook community. The present town continues to add residential areas to the north of the original townsite, and a secondary community of permanent homes a short distance to the north and west of the main townsite has also developed.\n\nThe precise current population of the unincorporated resort area/town or \"new\" Van Hook is not known, but in the summer with temporary residents might easily exceed the 1950 census number of 380. There are plans to get a population count of the current town(s) called Van Hook in the 2020 US Census.\n\n## Education\n\nThere was previously a school in Van Hook, of the New Town School District.\n\n## External links\n\n* Ghosttowns.com entry for Van Hook, North Dakota Be aware that most of the information on this site that labels Van Hook North Dakota as an uninhabited ghost town and underwater is inaccurate and completely outdated.\n\n* Shell highway map of North Dakota – 1940s\n\nFormer municipalities in North Dakota\nPopulated places established in 1914\nPopulated places disestablished in 1953\n1914 establishments in North Dakota\n1953 disestablishments in the United States\nMandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation\nPopulated places in Mountrail County, North Dakota"}

He made his debuts as a senior with the farm team in the 2014–15 campaign, in Tercera División.\n\nIn summer 2015, Córdoba spent the whole pre-season with the reserves, newly promoted to Segunda División. On 12 September of that year he made his professional debut aged 18, coming on as a late substitute for Aitor Seguín in a 0–1 away loss against Real Valladolid; he started seven of his 21 appearances in the second tier, and remained with the B-team after their relegation at the end of the season.\n\nAfter a year as a regular starter in the third level, Córdoba signed a new contract until 2021, and was invited to train with the senior side in the 2017 pre-season. He made his first team – and La Liga – debut on 20 August, replacing Mikel Balenziaga in a 0–0 home draw against Getafe CF. He scored his first goal in a domestic league fixture away to Villarreal CF on 9 April 2018, the opener in a 3–1 victory for his team. Before the end of the season he signed an extension to his contract, including a buyout clause of upwards of €30 million, running until June 2022.\n\n## Loans\n\nOn 1 February 2021, Córdoba joined Deportivo Alavés on loan for the remainder of the 2020–21 season.

The screenplay by Ernest Thompson centers on two small town couples, one married for several years and the other at the beginning of their relationship.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Hyde Park, Vermont at Paul and Martha Mullins' house. The school gym built as a film set remained in use as Hyde Park Elementary School's gym until 2017.\n\n## Plot\n\nIt's Halloween, and New England contractor Wiley Boon, married to his high school sweetheart Sandra and the father of three children, feels smothered after fifteen years of the same routine and is facing a midlife crisis. His best friend, local high school principal Sam Manners, is on the verge of starting a relationship with Adie Nims, a recent transplant from Florida and the new teacher at the grade school. During Thanksgiving dinner, Wiley and Sandra have a minor disagreement that prompts him to leave his family and move into a mobile home to sort through his feelings of emotional unrest. Using subsequent holidays as a background, the film focuses on both their efforts to recapture the magic of their early years together.\n\n## Cast\n\n* Don Johnson as Wiley Boon\n\n* Susan Sarandon as Sandra Boon\n\n* Jeff Daniels as Sam Manners\n\n* Elizabeth Perkins as Adie Nims\n\n* Kate Reid as Pearne Manners\n\n* Justin Henry as Kyle Boon\n\n* Holly Marie Combs as Debs Boon\n\n* Bernie Sanders as Bernie, a man giving out Halloween candy\n\n## Critical response\n\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times thought \"the rapport between the film's four principals is so well established that its romantic quadrille about the various ups and downs of two humorously contrasting couples really does come to life.\" She added, \"Sweet Hearts Dance . . . approaches love as a series of fits and starts. It approaches narrative in much the same way, which would be more of a problem if the film were not so enjoyably loose-jointed anyhow . . . [It] tends to drift, but it has good humor and an easygoing appeal, not to mention a thoroughly attractive cast.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film two out of four stars. He felt the screenplay \"seems to meander in whatever direction the filmmakers thought they could find an inspiration\" but added, \"And yet the film is not without merit. All of the performances are interesting, and although I was not surprised that three of the four leads were good, I was surprised at how effective Don Johnson was in his role. It's the best thing he's done, and shows he can do good things.\" He concluded, \"There were times when I thought I'd seen this movie before – maybe in The Four Seasons by Alan Alda or, for that matter, in any film by Alda. Made by sensitive, sophisticated middle-age men about sensitive middle-age men who are a little less sophisticated, the movie drips with nostalgia, but sometimes what everybody seems to want isn't love, but a gift certificate at L.L. Bean. The lifestyle itself threatens to upstage the drama, and as the wholesome New Englanders go about their wholesome New England pastimes, even suffering begins to look picturesque.\"\n\nRita Kempley of The Washington Post described the film as \"thirtysomething in needlepoint\" and commented, \"With its comfortable characters and small-town setting, it's as homey as hash – almost as if the director just threw it together like a housewife with unexpected company. It's not a grand movie, but an enjoyable midlife comedy that features Don Johnson in a breakthrough performance.\"\n\n## Box office\n\nThe film was not a box office success, only making $3 million on a budget of $9 million.\n\n## External links\n\n* \n\n* \n\n1988 films\n1988 comedy-drama films\nAmerican comedy-drama films\nFilms directed by Robert Greenwald\nFilms scored by Richard Gibbs\nFilms set in Vermont\nFilms shot in Vermont\nMidlife crisis films\nTriStar Pictures films\n1980s English-language films\n1980s American films\nEnglish-language comedy-drama films"}
{"id": "55070447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nc/Nga%20mice%20model", "title": "Nc/Nga mice model", "text": "Nc/Nga is an inbred mouse model bred in Japan at Nagoya University in 1957. It is used as a human atopic dermatitis model for its biological properties.\n\nIf kept under so called conventional conditions these mice develop skin lesions clinically and histologically very similar to human atopic dermatitis. The hair of these mice is rougher—especially on the head and dorsal skin. Erythema, haemorrhage, excoriation, erosion, scaling, and dryness are observed almost everywhere on the body—mainly on the face and ears. These symptoms do not develop if these mice are kept under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions. This supports the theory that atopic dermatitis development is influenced by both genetic predisposition and environment. The production of serum IgE is several times higher in mice kept under conventional condition than in those from SPF conditions. High level of serum IgE is typical for human dermatitis too.\n\nThe lesional skin shows hyperkeratosis in the epidermis. Another trade mark is heavy cell infiltrate in the dermis. This infiltrate consists mainly of Cd4-positive t-lymphocytes with less Cd8-positive t-lymphocytes and macrophages. Infiltration of these cells leads to higher activation of mast cells. Higher production of certain chemokines, cytokines, and respective receptors is also typical. Notably production of TARC (thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine) is significantly higher. This chemokine plays an important role in lesion pathogenesis. Cells infiltrating dermis produce cytokines typical for Th2 polarization especially IL-4 and IL-5. Considering receptors, CCR3 and CCR5 are expressed in both lesional and nonlesional skin but CCR5 is higher in lesional skin. CCR4 is receptor typically expressed in lesional skin only. CCR4 is a receptor for TARC. These differences in chemokines and cytokines production are observed only in Nc/Nga mice kept under conventional conditions.\n\nGenetic determinant responsible for atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions is located on chromosome 9. This quantitative trait loci (QTL) was named derm1 and is surrounded by seven genes possibly involved in atopic dermatitis onset and pathogenesis. These seven candidate genes are:\n\n- thymus cell antigen 1 theta (Thy1)\n\n- CD3 antigen delta, epsilon and gamma polypeptide (Cd3d,e,g)\n\n- interleukin-10 receptor alpha (Il10ra)\n\n- interleukin-18\n\n- C-terminal Src kinase (Csk).br>\n\nAll these genes or their products more precisely are involved in T lymphocytes development.\n\nDerm1 region is conserved on human chromosome 11q22.2-23.3 and 15q21-25. Nevertheless, no gene directly involved in atopic dermatitis development was located into this locus in human.\n\n## References\n\nAtopic dermatitis\nMedical tests\n1957 introductions\nImmunology mice"}

{"id": "151585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan%20Ross", "title": "Jonathan Ross", "text": "Jonathan Stephen Ross (born 17 November 1960) is an English broadcaster, film critic, comedian, actor, writer, and producer. He presented the BBC One chat show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross during the 2000s and early 2010s, hosted his own radio show on BBC Radio 2 from 1999 to 2010, and served as film critic and presenter of the Film programme. \n\nAfter leaving the BBC in 2010, Ross began hosting his comedy chat show The Jonathan Ross Show on ITV. Other regular roles have included being a panellist on the comedy sports quiz They Think It's All Over (1999–2005), being a presenter of the British Comedy Awards (1991–2007, 2009–2014), and being a judge on the musical competition show The Masked Singer (2020–present) and its spin-off series The Masked Dancer (2021–2022).\n\nRoss began his television career as a TV researcher, before débuting as a presenter for The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross on Channel 4 in 1987. Over the next decade, he presented numerous radio and television programmes, many through his own production company, Channel X. In 1995, he sold his stake in Channel X, and embarked on a career with the BBC in 1997. In 1999, Ross took over presenting the Film programme from Barry Norman, and also began presenting his own radio show, while two years later he began hosting Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. For the chat show, Ross won three BAFTA awards for Best Entertainment Performance, in 2004, 2006 and 2007. \n\nIn 2005, Ross was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to broadcasting. Ross has been involved in controversies throughout his broadcasting career. As a result, in 2008, he wrote a semi-autobiographical work titled Why Do I Say These Things?, detailing some of his life experiences. He has also written his own comic books, Turf and America's Got Powers.\n\n## Early life and education\n\nJonathan Stephen Ross was born on 17 November 1960 in St Pancras, north London and raised in Leytonstone, east London. The son of John and actress Martha Ross, he has four brothers and one sister. He is the younger brother of journalist, television editor, and media personality Paul Ross.\n\nTheir mother put all of her children forward for roles in television advertisements. Ross first appeared in a television advertisement for the breakfast cereal Kellogg's Rice Krispies in 1970, when he was 10 years old. He also appeared in an ad for the laundry detergent Persil.\n\nRoss was educated at the comprehensive schools Norlington School for Boys and Leyton County High School for Boys. He then studied at the Southampton College of Art and took a degree in Modern European History at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES) in London, which today forms part of University College London.\n\nRoss began his adult career as a researcher on the Channel 4 show Loose Talk. After leaving this, he worked on various other shows before beginning another research job on Soul Train, which became Solid Soul. It is believed his first appearance on television was as an extra in the 1981 It Ain't Half Hot, Mum episode The Last Roll Call.\n\n## 1987–95: Channel X\n\nWhilst on Solid Soul, he met fellow researcher Alan Marke, and the two devised what would prove to be a breakthrough hit for Ross in 1987, The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross.\n\nThe two men based their concept on the successful American show Late Night with David Letterman, and formed a new production company called Channel X, to produce a pilot. Ross had not planned to be the show's host, but he presented the show from its debut in January 1987.\n\nWhile the series was initially a co-production with Colin Callender, ownership transferred to Marke and Ross, meaning that the latter retained a great deal of control as well as being presenter. The show was successful for both Ross and for Channel 4, making him one of the major personalities on the channel. A year later, his documentary series The Incredibly Strange Film Show introduced many to the works of cult filmmakers like Sam Raimi and Jackie Chan. Ross and Raimi appeared together in a British television advertisement for Raimi's 1987 film Evil Dead II.\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, his television documentary series Jonathan Ross Presents for One Week Only profiled and interviewed directors including Alejandro Jodorowsky, David Lynch, Aki Kaurismäki and in 2014, the Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar.\n\nIn 1989, he co-presented the biennial BBC charity telethon Comic Relief, the same year he launched One Hour with Jonathan Ross a short lived chat show on Channel 4. Its game show segment, \"Knock down ginger\", introduced comedians such as Vic Reeves, Bob Mortimer, Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson to television. In December 1989, Ross appeared on Cilla's Goodbye to the 80s and presented all four members of Queen with the \"Top Band of the Eighties\" prize in a broadcast for ITV which would turn out to be Freddie Mercury's penultimate public appearance before his death from AIDS in 1991.\n\nRoss presented the annual British Comedy Awards each year from 1991 to 2014 with the exception of 2008 following his suspension from the BBC. In 1992 he presented an interview with Madonna about her Erotica album and Sex Book promotion.\n\nRoss has appeared in numerous television entertainment programmes on several channels throughout the 1990s and 2000s. He was a regular panellist on the sports quiz They Think It's All Over, and hosted the panel game It's Only TV...But I Like It. Other projects include the BBC joke-quiz Gagtag, the Channel 4 variety show Saturday Zoo, new-acts showcase The Big Big Talent Show, and the ITV programme Fantastic Facts.\n\nIn 1995, he left Channel X, despite its profitable nature. He was quoted in a 1998 article as stating:\n\n## 1995–2006\n\nIn 1995, he presented Mondo Rosso, a programme about old cult films. He took over presenting of the Film programme, the BBC's long-running cinema review series, in 1999 after Barry Norman left the show. Ross himself has made a number of cameo appearances in films, playing himself in the Spice Girls' film Spice World (1997) and voicing the character of Doris in the UK version of Shrek 2 (2004). In 2001 he also played himself in Only Fools and Horses, presenting Goldrush, a fictional television quiz on which the main character, Del, was a contestant. In 2001 he voiced characters in two episodes of the animated comedy series Rex the Runt. He also appeared on the first pilot show for Shooting Stars, acting as a team captain.\n\nHe was the subject of This Is Your Life in March 2001 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at the BBC Television Centre.\n\n## 1987, 1999–2010, 2014–2018: BBC Radio\n\nRoss's first radio work was on BBC Radio 1 in 1987, when he sat in for Janice Long for two weeks. Ross began presenting a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2 in July 1999. He has also presented radio shows for Virgin Radio (having previously worked on Richard Branson's earlier venture, Radio Radio), as well as the now-defunct commercial radio network service The Superstation, where his producer was Chris Evans. Ross's show on Radio 2 last aired on 17 July 2010 when his contract at the BBC ended.\n\nIn August 2014, he returned to Radio 2 as a stand-in presenter on Steve Wright's afternoon show for four days. \nIn March 2015 Jonathan sat in for Steve Wright again from 16 to 27 March 2015. In February 2016 Ross returned to Radio 2 on a regular basis to present the weekly arts show. From January 11, 2018, Anneka Rice took over the arts show.\n\n## 2001–10: ''Friday Night with Jonathan Ross'' and other projects\n\nOn 2 November 2001, Ross began presenting his BBC One comedy chat show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross.\n\nIn 2004, Ross presented a documentary on one of his favourite subjects, punk rock, for the BBC.\n\nIn November 2005, Ross appeared on Gordon Ramsay's The F Word where Ramsay shows Ross how to kill lobster.\n\nIn 2005, Ross anchored the BBC television coverage of the Live 8 concerts. Later that year he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting. He celebrated the news by playing \"God Save the Queen\" by The Sex Pistols (which was banned by the BBC when released in 1977) on his BBC Radio 2 Saturday morning show. On 21 June 2006, Ross was made a Fellow of University College London, where he studied.\n\nIn early 2006, Ross announced that after eight years he was quitting his regular panellist seat on the sport/comedy quiz show They Think It's All Over explaining: \"I need time now to focus on my other commitments and so regrettably I won't be back for the 20th series.\" Following Ross's departure, only two more episodes of the show were made before it was cancelled.\n\nIn January 2006 he presented Jonathan Ross' Asian Invasion, broadcast on BBC Four. The three-part documentary followed Ross as he explored the film industry in Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea, interviewing directors and showcasing clips. His interest in East Asian culture and his self-confessed love for Japanese anime and video games led him to making three series of BBC Three show Japanorama, as well as producing another television series for the same channel called Adam and Joe Go Tokyo, starring Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish. He produced the latter programme through his own television production company Hot Sauce.\n\nIn June 2006, a bidding war was sparked between BBC and other broadcasters for Ross's services. Although other broadcasters were unsuccessful in poaching Ross, it is believed that their bids were higher than the BBC during negotiations. ITV, who bid for Ross, poached chat host Michael Parkinson around the same time. Ross became the highest paid television personality in Britain, when a new BBC contract secured his services until 2010, for a reported £18 million (£6 million per year). That same month, he was named by Radio Times as the most powerful person in British radio.\n\nOn 25 June 2006, he performed at the Children's Party at the Palace for the Queen's 80th birthday. In August 2006, Ross asked the first question in the Yahoo! Answers \"Five Million Answers challenge\". On 16 March 2007, Ross hosted Comic Relief 2007 alongside Fearne Cotton and Lenny Henry.\n\nOn 7 July 2007, Ross co-presented (with Graham Norton) BBC television coverage of the Live Earth climate change awareness concerts, which became the subject of controversy due to the foul language used by performers including Phil Collins,Madonna and Johnny Borrell, resulting in one of Ofcom's toughest sanctions to date on the BBC. Ross had been required to apologise on the day for the language used by Collins and Borrell.\n\nRoss is well-known as an enthusiastic comic book collector. Starting on 10 September 2007, he presented the BBC Four series Comics Britannia, about the history of the British comic. This forms the core of a Comics Britannia season, which includes another documentary, In Search of Steve Ditko, by Ross. Ross is also greatly interested in Japan, presenting a BBC-TV series on many different aspects of Japanese culture, Japanorama, for three series between 2002 and 2007. In May 2008, Ross won the Sony Gold Award \"Music Radio Personality of the Year\". On 3 August 2008, he hosted Jonathan Ross Salutes Dad's Army, a BBC One tribute to the sitcom set during World War II.\n\nIn 2010, Ross took part in Channel 4's Comedy Gala, a benefit show held in aid of Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, filmed live at The O2 Arena in London on 30 March. On 7 April 2010, Ross's first comic book was published. Turf was written by Jonathan himself and drawn by artist Tommy Lee Edwards. In 2011, Ross wrote an introduction for The Steve Ditko Omnibus Vol. 1, a collection of work by the American comics artist featured in Ross's 2007 documentary.\n\n## 2010: Leaving the BBC\n\nOn 7 January 2010, Ross confirmed that he would leave the BBC in July 2010. This would see him leave all his regular BBC roles, namely his Friday night chat show, Radio 2 show and the film review programme, although he would be continuing with some specials, such as Comic Relief and the BAFTA Awards.\n\nRoss said that while he \"had a wonderful time working for the BBC\" he had \"decided not to re-negotiate when my current contract comes to an end,\" a choice which was \"not financially motivated\". The announcement came a day after it became public knowledge that Graham Norton had signed a two-year deal with the BBC. Torin Douglas, the corporation's media correspondent speculated Norton would be a ready-made replacement for Ross's chat show role, while Mark Kermode of BBC Radio 5 Live was a potential successor in the film review role, but that \"replacing Ross on radio will be harder.\" Ross last appeared on the film programme in Episode 10 of Film 2010 with Jonathan Ross aired on 17 March 2010. After Kermode publicly ruled himself out on 26 March, Claudia Winkleman was announced 30 March 2010 as his replacement as host of the Film programme.\n\nRoss's final Friday Night chat show episode aired on 16 July 2010, with David Beckham, Jackie Chan, Mickey Rourke, and Roxy Music as guests. Ross ended the show with an affectionate tribute to his guests and to the audience, while mentioning that he had promised Morrissey that he would remain composed and \"wouldn't cry.\" His final Radio 2 show was broadcast the following day. Patrick Kielty initially took over Ross's Radio 2 slot, after which Graham Norton took over permanently from 2 October that year.\n\n## 2010–present: ITV and Channel 4\n\nOn 19 December 2010, Ross presented a three-hour Channel 4 list show, 100 Greatest Toys, with the broadcaster describing Ross as a \"huge toy enthusiast with a private collection that would rival any museum's\". In 2012, Ross's voice appeared as a headteacher in Back to School at the Edinburgh Festival. In October 2013, Ross was hired by Xbox (Microsoft) to help promote the brand. In 2011, he presented Penn & Teller: Fool Us on ITV, a collaboration with magicians Penn & Teller, which he would resume hosting when the show moved to The CW in 2014.\n\nRoss's new chat show, The Jonathan Ross Show, began on 3 September 2011 on ITV1, drawing an audience of 4.3m viewers, compared to the 4.6m for his finale on the BBC show. The first series ran for thirteen weeks. Speaking about the new show, Ross said: \"I am thrilled and excited that after a short break I will be rolling up my sleeves and creating a brand new show for ITV1.\"\n\nOn 20 October 2014, it was announced by ITV that Ross had signed a new contract with ITV. The new contract will see him present two more series of his chatshow along with a Christmas Special on ITV in 2015. ITV's Director of Entertainment and Comedy Elaine Bedell added: \"Jonathan is the king of talk shows and a valued member of the ITV family. He continues to attract the biggest names in showbiz onto his sofa and I am delighted that he will remain on the channel until at least the end of 2015.\" Ross said: \"I've been lucky enough to interview some of the biggest stars around on The Jonathan Ross Show and I'm delighted that I'll continue to do so for ITV until at least the end of 2015 with two series booked for the channel for next year.\" \nIn November 2014, Ross designed a Paddington Bear statue, one of fifty created by various celebrities which were located around London prior to the release of the film Paddington, with the statues auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).\n\nIn 2015, Ross's 2004 interview with Amy Winehouse was featured in Asif Kapadia's highly praised documentary film about the late singer, entitled Amy. In 2017, Ross was a team captain along with Frank Skinner on the ITV panel show Don't Ask Me Ask Britain. In December 2017, Ross presented Guess the Star, a one-off special for ITV. On 9 September 2019, Ross was announced as a judge for The Masked Singer UK, the UK version of the international music game show Masked Singer, which aired on ITV from January 2020.\n\nIn September 2020, Ross started hosting his own 30-minute weekly ITV show called Jonathan Ross' Comedy Club. On 4 March 2021, it was announced by ITV that Ross would be on the celebrity panel of a brand new spin-off show of The Masked Singer UK, The Masked Dancer, which aired in spring 2021. Ross made his debut appearance on Celebrity Gogglebox on 2 July 2021, and was joined by his son, Harvey, daughter Honey and her boyfriend. In March 2023, Ross replaced Andrew Collins as presenter of the weekly radio show Saturday Night at the Movies on Classic FM.\n\n## Personal life\n\nRoss married the author, journalist, and broadcaster Jane Goldman in 1988. They have since had three children: Betty Kitten, Harvey Kirby (named after Jack Kirby, a comic book creator whom Ross especially admires), and Honey Kinny. In 2005, Ross was made an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting. He celebrated the news by playing \"God Save the Queen\" by the Sex Pistols on his Radio 2 show.\n\nRoss resides in Hampstead, London. He owns a second home in Swanage in Dorset and owns property in Florida in the United States.\n\nRoss and others have used his rhotacism for comic effect, and he is sometimes known as \"Wossy\", including on his Twitter feed (@wossy).\n\nRoss is a big pop and rock music fan and maintains a particular interest in British punk rock, which captivated him when he was young. The first band he saw in concert was punk band X-Ray Spex at Islington's Hope and Anchor pub in North London. He paid tribute to lead singer Poly Styrene following her death. He has described himself as \"about as big a fan of David Bowie as you will find on the planet\". The glam art rock band Roxy Music are one of his all-time favourite acts and were invited to perform on the final episode of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross.\n\nRoss is a fan of science fiction, including Doctor Who. He contributed his early memories of the series, which included the 1968 serial The Invasion, to a book which raised funds for Alzheimer's Research UK.\n\nRoss is a fan of the animation studio Studio Ghibli, especially the works of director Hayao Miyazaki, and has been an early proponent of its works before its international popularity. He first saw Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind in 1987, which he praises as \"massively underrated\", and considers Spirited Away to be a \"masterpiece\". He would later interview Miyazaki for Japanorama. Ross provided a minor voice role in one episode of Ronja, the Robber's Daughter.\n\nRoss is also a fan of comic books and co-owned a comic shop in London with Paul Gambaccini. He released Turf, his first comic book, in 2010, with American artist Tommy Lee Edwards. \n\nRoss has attended a fundraiser for the James Randi Educational Foundation called The Amazing Meeting in London in 2009 and 2010. Ross has described himself as a big fan of James Randi and the other speakers – who were mainly prominent sceptics – and said that he and his wife had come to have a sceptical view of the world. Ross has been supportive of Simon Singh's efforts to defend an accusation of libel by the British Chiropractic Association and Ross has posed for the Geek Calendar 2011, a fund raiser for The Libel Reform Campaign.\n\nRoss's mother, Martha Ross, died on 14 January 2019, at the age of 79.\n\nIn 2023, Ross was integral to the preservation of the arcade version of Um Jammer Lammy, previously thought to be lost media, by allowing video game archivists access to his arcade cabinet, thought of as one of the world's last examples.\n\n## BBC contract\n\nIn April 2006, details of his fees and those of other BBC personalities were leaked to the tabloid press. It was claimed at the time, by a then-unidentified BBC mole, that Ross earned £530,000 per year for hosting his Radio 2 show (equivalent to £10,000 per show). While refusing to comment specifically on the leak in line with BBC policy on the matter, Ross did hint during his radio show that the figure was exaggerated; in addition to this, any pay highlighted as being \"his\" would actually be split between himself and his producer/co-presenter on the show, Andy Davies.\n\n## David Cameron interview\n\nIn June 2006, when Conservative Party leader David Cameron appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Ross began a line of questioning relating to Conservative ex-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, culminating in the question \"Did you or did you not have a wank thinking of Margaret Thatcher?\" Ross was defended by the BBC publicly, but repeat showings of the interview have been banned.\n\n## \"1,000 journalists\" comment\n\nOn 5 December 2007, Ross joked at the British Comedy Awards that his salary meant that he was \"apparently worth 1,000 BBC journalists\". His quip came shortly after the BBC had announced plans for more than 2,000 job cuts, and was condemned as \"obscene\" by the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists. Ross has denied this and in a 2011 article is quoted as saying that he was commenting on a piece that was written in a newspaper about his salary being that of 1,000 journalists:\n\n## Gwyneth Paltrow interview\n\nThe BBC Trust ruled that Ross's interview with American actress Gwyneth Paltrow, broadcast on 2 May 2008, breached editorial guidelines. They ruled that bad language in an episode of Ross's pre-recorded BBC1 chat show, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, in which the presenter told Paltrow he \"would fuck her\", was \"gratuitous and unnecessarily offensive\". The trust said it disagreed with the judgement made by BBC management that the episode should be broadcast uncensored, adding that the comment was made in an \"overly sexual way\" and that it had upheld a number of complaints made about the edition of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. The trust reminded BBC staff that \"the casual gratuitous use of the most offensive language is not acceptable on the BBC in accordance with the BBC's existing guidelines and practices\", adding that \"this particularly applies in entertainment programmes\".\n\n## ''The Russell Brand Show'' and Andrew Sachs\n\nFollowing a guest appearance by Ross on The Russell Brand Show broadcast on 18 October 2008, Ross was suspended for 12 weeks without pay by the BBC on 29 October, after a series of lewd answerphone messages, including Ross saying, \"He fucked your granddaughter\", were left for then 78-year-old actor Andrew Sachs regarding Sachs' granddaughter Georgina Baillie, by Russell Brand and Ross, which were broadcast on the pre-recorded show. After little initial interest, a media story about the calls by the Daily Mail generated a high number of complaints. Brand resigned from the BBC, while Ross was suspended without pay. BBC director general Mark Thompson stated that Ross should take the disciplinary action as a \"final warning\". The BBC was later fined £150,000 by Britain's broadcast regulator for airing the calls.\n\nOn 21 November 2008, the BBC Trust said that the phone calls were a \"deplorable intrusion with no editorial justification\". The trust gave its backing to Ross's 12-week suspension but recommended that no further action be taken against him. He returned to work in January 2009 with a new series of Friday Night. From 23 May 2009, Ross's BBC Radio 2 show was recorded 24 hours before broadcast.\n\n## Homophobia accusation\n\nOn 13 May 2009, Ross was accused of homophobia after a comment he made on his radio show, in which he said,\n\nAn incorrect version of this quote was also circulated, in which Ross was accused of saying:\n\nOfcom received 61 complaints following the comment. On 7 July 2009, Ofcom ruled that Ross did not breach the broadcasting code. They wrote in their opinion that \"the comment was clearly presented as a joke intended to make light of the reactions that some parents may have if their child chooses a toy that is very widely recognised to be designed and marketed for the opposite sex\" and that the nature of the joke and tone and manner in which it was presented \"made clear that it was not intended to be hostile or pejorative towards the gay community in general.\" Stonewall criticised the ruling; saying \"the fact that a comment is light-hearted does not absolve it from perpetuating the stereotypes that lead to homophobic bullying.\"\n\n## Hugo Awards\n\nOn 1 March 2014 Loncon 3, the 72nd World Science Fiction Convention, announced that Ross would be the Master of Ceremonies for the 2014 Hugo Awards ceremony, to be held in August at ExCeL London. This generated angry criticism from members of science fiction fandom who objected to the idea, citing Ross's record of controversial statements and actions. Convention committee member Farah Mendlesohn strongly objected to the choice of Ross as MC, and resigned when the Loncon 3 Co-Chairs would not reconsider the choice, writing (in part), '[Ross] is a man who has made a fortune (6 million a year at one point) from abusing others—particularly women—live on air.' He publicly withdrew as MC not long after the announcement, tweeting 'I have decided to withdraw from hosting the Hugo's @loncon3 in response to some who would rather I weren't there. Have a lovely convention.'\n\n## Honours and awards\n\n* 2005, Ross was made an OBE by Prince Charles in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting.\n\n* 2006, made a Fellow of University College, London (UCL), into which his alma mater, SSEES, had been absorbed.\n\n* 2012, Special Recognition award at the National Television Awards.\n\n## Further reading\n\n* Jonathan Ross: The Biography, Neil Simpson, John Blake Publishing Ltd (31 July 2007), \n\n* Why Do I Say These Things?, Jonathan Ross, Bantam Press (16 October 2008),\n\n## External links\n\n* The Jonathan Ross Show on itv.com\n\n* Classic FM at the Movies with Jonathan Ross on Classic FM\n\n* \n\n* Interactive video talk by Jonathan Ross on Ealing studios for the British Film Institute\n\n1960 births\nLiving people\n21st-century English screenwriters\n20th-century English male actors\n21st-century English male actors\n21st-century English writers\nAlumni of Southampton Solent University\nAlumni of University College London\nAlumni of the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies\nBest Entertainment Performance BAFTA Award (television) winners\nBBC Radio 2 presenters\nBBC television presenters\nEnglish comics writers\nComic collectors\nEnglish male television writers\nBusinesspeople from the London Borough of Camden\nComedians from the London Borough of Camden\nEnglish film critics\nEnglish game show hosts\nEnglish male comedians\nEnglish male film actors\nEnglish male non-fiction writers\nEnglish male television actors\nEnglish male voice actors\nEnglish people with disabilities\nEnglish radio DJs\nEnglish television talk show hosts\nEnglish television writers\nFriday Night with Jonathan Ross\nGovernors of the British Film Institute\nMale actors from London\nOfficers of the Order of the British Empire\nPeople from Leytonstone\nPeople from St Pancras, London\nPeople with speech disorders\nRadio presenters from London\nJonathan\nTelevision personalities from the London Borough of Camden\nTelevision producers from London\nImage Comics writers"}

He was appointed Captain of the Presidio of Bexar. Later, Governor Fernando Pérez de Almazán became him in lieutenant governor. This office allowed him to occupy the positions of acting governor and interim governor of Texas when Almazán decided to resign from his charge as governor in 1727.\n\nUnder his administration, Mediavilla y Azcona promoted the foundation of several missions by friars in a zone located between the Colorado and Brazos Rivers, although these foundations (the San Xavier missions) were carried out in 1748 and 1749, when Azcona had left the office of governor of Texas.\n\nWhile Mediavilla y Azcona was governor, Inspector Pedro de Rivera y Villalón revised political management of Mediavilla and found several errors in his administration of the presidio. Villalón recommended to the Viceroy to reduce the number of officials of the presidio, as well as the price of the supplies that the garrison needed, and to remove some of their equipment, because not all that was in the garrison was necessary. He also indicated that the Presidio de Nuestra Señora de los Dolores should be removed and the number of military men that formed the garrison of Nuestra Señora del Pilar was too high and should be limited to only 60 people. Mediavilla accepted Rivera's suggestions and these were carried out, despite the fact that the Viceroy of New Spain, Juan de Acuña, had refused to approve its realization. This caused disaffection among Mediavilla and the viceroy.\n\nOn 5 March 1731 (and following the Rivera's advice), three missions were renamed in San Antonio:\n\n* Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de los Hainai was renamed Nuestra Señora de la Purisima Concepción de Acuña;\n\n* San Francisco de los Neches was renamed San Francisco de la Espada;\n\n* San Jose de los Nazones was renamed San Juan Capistrano.\n\nOn the other hand, in March 1731, when a group of Spanish settlers from the Canary Islands came to San Antonio to help populate the place, it was the captain of the presidio of San Antonio, Juan Antonio Perez de Almazan (and not Mediavilla), who was in charge of welcoming them and providing them with accommodation. This was because \nMediavilla was never an official governor of Texas, as he never was appointed to the position by the viceroy of New Spain, but only by the previous governor.\n\nHe governed the province until 1731, when the Viceroy Acuña appointed a new governor, Juan Antonio Bustillo y Ceballos.\n\n## References\n\nMediavilla\nMediavilla\nMediavilla\nMediavilla\nMediavilla"}

Her research involves the development of new astrophysical models to understand low mass stars and exoplanets. She was awarded a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award in 2010 and delivered the 2023 European Astronomical Society Lodewijk Woltjer Lecture.\n\n## Early life and education\n\nBaraffe was born in France. She completed her master's degree in physics at the Paris Diderot University. She remained there for her doctoral research, studying jointly at the University of Göttingen. Her research considered the evolution of non-metallic stars. She was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and the University of Göttingen.\n\n## Research and career\n\nBaraffe joined the École normale supérieure de Lyon.? She moved to the Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon as a professor of astrophysics. In 2010, Baraffe joined the University of Exeter. Her research considers stellar hydrodynamics and exoplanets. Barafee has developed theoretical models to explore low mass stars and substellar objects, including brown dwarfs and exoplanets. The scientific community first became interested in low mass stars after the first report of brown dwarfs in 1995 (Gliese 229b), and Baraffe's reference models were used to create plans for observations. Baraffe pioneered the theoretical foundations of exoplanets, and her calculations have been used to understand observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope and Extremely Large Telescope.\n\nShe developed numerical tools that combine computational approaches with complex physics to study the dynamics of astrophysics. Her three-dimensional code MUSIC (MUlti-dimensional Stellar Implicit Code) can predict fundamental astrophysical processes and was awarded two European Research Council grants. She developed the field of asteroseismology – the use of pulsation modes to investigate the study of the inside of stars.\n\n## Awards and honours\n\n* 1999 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Bronze Medal\n\n* 2004 Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam Johann WEMPE Prize\n\n* 2005 Gauss-Professorship\n\n* 2010 Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award\n\n* 2015 Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics Biermann lectures\n\n* 2018 Elected to the Science and Technology Facilities Council Council\n\n* 2020 Viktor Ambartsumian International Science Prize\n\n* 2023 European Astronomical Society Lodewijk Woltjer Lecture\n\n* 2024 Institute of Physics Fred Hoyle Medal and Prize\n\n## References\n\nLiving people\nUniversity of Göttingen alumni\nParis Diderot University alumni\nFrench women physicists\nAcademics of the University of Exeter\nYear of birth missing (living people)\nPlace of birth missing (living people)\nFrench emigrants to the United Kingdom\n20th-century French physicists\n21st-century French physicists"}

His original destination may have been Sydney, but while the ship was in Hobart, he met a cousin, surgeon Captain Russell of the 63rd Regiment, who persuaded him to settle in Van Diemen's Land (later Tasmania). Cudmore found employment as a schoolmaster, then at Peter DeGraves' (1878 – 31 December 1852) Cascade Brewery at The Cascades in Hobart.\n\nA year later they received news of the Proclamation of South Australia, and he chartered a yacht and with a cargo of supplies headed for the new colony, arriving at Holdfast Bay early in 1837, Mary following in the Siren, on which yacht their second child, James Francis, was born.\n\n## Business interests and properties\n\nCudmore was a partner in the Adelaide Union Brewing Company, located opposite the office of the Southern Australian on Rundle Street in 1838. In August 1843 he took out a wine and beer licence for the \"Harp Inn\" (later \"Harp of Tara\") on North East Road, near Dry Creek. In the early 1840s he built a substantial brewery and a malt factory off Melbourne Street, North Adelaide, which perhaps became the Lion Brewing and Malting Company.\n\nIn 1847 the news came that he had inherited a considerable property, \"Manister\", in County Limerick, Ireland from Jane Cudmore (c.1803 – 7 May 1847), a cousin. He arranged for it to be sold and with the proceeds purchased pastoral properties in the mid-north of South Australia: Yongala, Pinda, and Beautiful Valley (situated between Mount Remarkable and Port Augusta Stations). He also purchased the Paringa cattle station. He left management of these properties to his sons and went to Queensland. \n\nHe took up a station on the Clarke River, a tributary of the Burdekin River, and purchased on the Herbert River, near Cardwell for a sugar plantation. In 1871 he purchased Avoca Station, at the junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers in New South Wales, and in 1876 added the adjoining Popiltah Station, making a total leasehold of and freehold of near Wentworth.\n\nHis sons Daniel Henry, Milo Robert, and Arthur Frederick together ran Avoca and Popiltah stations in New South Wales, Oakvale in South Australia, and Boondoon in Queensland, as Cudmore Brothers. In 1895 Daniel Henry left the partnership to take over Boondoon.\n\n## Personal life and homes\n\nDaniel was a strong swimmer, and saved several people from drowning.\n\nHe wrote several poems, published under the title Poetical Scraps.\n\nIn 1862 he bought \"Hartley Bank\", near Glen Osmond, built in 1848 by Alfred Hardy, one of Colonel Light's survey team. He renamed it \"Claremont\" and immediately set about enlarging it.\n\nIn 1889, Cudmore bought a property and dwelling near Victor Harbor, South Australia formerly owned by the son of the Governor of South Australia, John Hindmarsh and then his son. Cudmore had the house rebuilt to a grand dwelling to plans by architect Frederick Dancker, complete with three turrets. The property, known as Adare House, has been in the hands of the Uniting Church since the second half of the 20th century.\n\n## Family\n\nCudmore married Mary Nihill in 1835, at home \"Claremont,\" Glen Osmond.

{"id": "17460698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton%20County%20Courthouse%20%28Ohio%29", "title": "Fulton County Courthouse (Ohio)", "text": "The Fulton County Courthouse, built in 1870, is a historic courthouse building located in Wauseon, Ohio. On May 7, 1973, it was added to the National Register.\n\n## History\n\nFulton County was established in 1850 from parts of Williams and Lucas counties. The Ohio General Assembly appointed three commissioners to select the county seat of the newly formed county. They chose a location at the geographical center of the county, and named it \"Centre.\"\n\nThe village was renamed Ottokee shortly thereafter at the suggestion of Col. Dresden Howard to honor the Odawa Chief Ot-to-kee. The courts were held in the home of Robert Howard until a courthouse could be constructed. In 1851 the completed two-story wood-frame structure rising to a dome. This courthouse burned in a fire in 1864 forcing the county to hastily plan a new second courthouse.\n\nThis second courthouse was constructed out of brick. The facade was punctuated by pilasters separating the arched windows. This courthouse served the county until a decision was made to move the county seat. Years after the move the old courthouse was still in use as the county infirmary.\n\nOttokee remained the county seat and defeated many attempts to move the courts, until 1869, when a railroad company surveyed the area and chose Wauseon as a stopping point. The county seat relocated there shortly thereafter. The same act that established the new county seat was passed, it also included $5,000 to complete a new courthouse.\n\nThis new courthouse, the third for the county, and the first for Wauseon, was completed in 1872 and is in use today. The architect, C.C. Miller, designed the courthouse in the Italianate style and Alexander Voss and H.B. Bensman were responsible for building and construction. The total cost of the courthouse was $45,722.27.\n\n## Exterior\n\nThe primary bulk of the courthouse is a long rectangular block with a central projection; an addition was added to the rear of the building. The red brick structure rests on a rusticated sandstone foundation, which is pierced by small square windows. The first floor is illuminated by square windows with a slight arch and each is topped with a decorative header; the second floor windows are long arched windows with the same header treatment. Between the windows are pilasters rising from the foundation to the roofline. The hipped roof rests on an entablature decorated with dentil moldings. The roof rises to a flat roof which in turn supports a central tower with arched windows.\n\nThe central projection contains a portico with arched openings and contains the entrance. Arched windows light the second floor and a balcony is located in the front. The entablature carries over onto the projection with the tower rising for another two levels before terminating in platform lined with a balustrade. Below this platform is a four-faced clock and arched vents where the courthouse bell is kept.\n\n## Interior\n\nThe building's main entry is set in the middle of the front tower. After walking through the vestibule, one can turn immediately to the left and climb a staircase to the second-story courtroom. Extensive artwork is present in the courtroom, including murals of interactions between Indians and Americans during the county's earliest years, multiple oil paintings, and wood carvings, plus a dome with stained glass.\n\n## Renovations\n\nIn October 2018, major renovations began on the courthouse. Fulton County commissioners awarded a $3.86 million contract last week to Mosser Construction for the renovation work, which is expected to take 10 months, according to the commissioners’ office. The project's total budget, including design costs, was set at about $4.2 million. The project will include replacement of the heating and cooling systems, the addition of security and technology features, a new elevator that is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, updates to offices, and a historic restoration of the common pleas courtroom.

It offered financial products and services including savings accounts, term deposits, housing, commercial and personal loans and other services such as secure self-storage facilities, and delivery of Bank Statements through the Bank Link system.\n\nIn 2011, ABS Building Society merged with Newcastle based Greater Building Society (now Greater Bank) and continues to provide services to the region under the Greater brand. ABS had one branch in Armidale and an agency in Guyra, which have continued to operate since the merger.\n\n## History\n\nABS Building Society Limited (ABS) was formed by a group of businessmen led by Armidale accountant Mr Alwyn W. Jones in 1970 to facilitate home ownership in the New England region by providing access to affordable loan funds. Mr Jones was the founding Chief Executive whose accounting firm, now known as Jones Cracknell & Starr, provided management services to ABS from its inception.

It is a long, slender fish that grows to a maximum length of about .\n\n## Description\n\nBichirs are primitive fish which have a jaw structure that resembles that of tetrapods rather than bony fishes; they also have rudimentary lungs and two slit-like spiracles used for exhalation, and can breathe air when there is insufficient oxygen in the water. The West African bichir has an elongated cylindrical body with a maximum length of . It can be distinguished from other members of the genus by having jaws that are about the same length, and in living specimens, having creamy-white irises speckled with black. The dorsal fin consists of 7 to 9 separate finlets each topped with a sharp spine. The pectoral fin is fleshy and has 30 to 32 soft rays and the anal fin has 12 to 15 spines. The dorsal surface and flanks are olive brown with irregular markings of darker brown and the ventral surface is whitish or pale beige. The dorsal and caudal fins are pale beige with dark marks in rows, and black blotches at the base of the spines. The pectoral fins have distinctive black blotches at the base and rows of tiny black spots on the webbing. The pelvic and anal fins are whitish.\n\n## Distribution\n\nThe West African bichir is a freshwater fish native to tropical West Africa. Its range includes the basins of the Ogooué River and the Congo River, and possibly the Cross River basin in Cameroon. Its typical habitat is swamps and floodplains.\n\n## Behaviour\n\nThis species is territorial, with territory holders threatening intruders. The attacker starts the encounter by raising its dorsal fin spines and emitting staccato thumping sounds; both fish may continue by biting at each other, or one may submit and flee, emitting drawn-out moans.\n\n## Use in aquaria\n\nP. retropinnis is sometimes kept in aquaria. It will feed on small to medium-sized vertebrates and invertebrates, eating anything it can fit into its mouth.\n\n## References\n\nPolypteridae\nFreshwater fish of Africa\nFish of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nFish of Gabon\nFish described in 1899\nTaxa named by Léon Vaillant"}

Introduced in 2001, the CS-336 was the Custom Shop's first \"tonally carved\" guitar, meaning that the back, center block, and sides are carved from one single piece of wood (mahogany). This solid block of wood is mated to a carved maple top. After over 100 years, the CS-336 also represented the realization of company founder Orville Gibson's goal to produce an instrument with one-piece back-and-sides construction. \n\nThe CS-336 is a scaled-down version of another Gibson guitar, the Gibson ES-335.\n\n## Evolution and related models\n\nIn 1996, Gibson's Custom Shop introduced the ES-336 (\"ES\" is an abbreviation for \"Electric Spanish\"). The ES-336 had a one-piece mahogany back and a contoured maple top. When the CS-336 was introduced five years later, it added the center block and top bracing as an integral part of the back and top pieces (the final step in creating a tonally carved instrument).\n\nES-335: Introduced in 1958 and the key shape basis for all models listed below.\nES-336: Introduced in 1996, this model was replaced by the CS-336 in 2001.\nCS-336: the subject of this article; Gibson's first \"tonally carved\" guitar.\nCS-356: constructed in the same manner as the CS-336, with a range of \"upscale\" appointments such as gold-finished hardware.\nES-339: same shape as the 336 and 356 models, but not a tonally carved instrument - it has the laminated maple top, maple centerblock, and spruce contour bracing construction of an ES-335. This combination makes the ES-339 a lighter and less expensive guitar than the CS-336. The neck profiles on the CS-336 and ES-339 also differ. The ES-339 offers either a 1959 neck profile (a rounded, chunkier neck) or a slim 30/60 neck.\n\nCS-336 P90 In 2017, Gibson produced 200 CS-336 Mahogany Limited Editions with two Custom P90 pickups specially designed for this model.

It is an incorporated association or government-registered non-profit group.\n\n## Activities\n\nMost recently, the Eureka Council has been involved in the fight to save a national treasure from property developers. Rose Cottage and the Australian Pioneer Village in Hawkesbury, NSW is currently being threatened by a local council resolution to sell the artefacts contained in the village. A rally was held on the 28 June 2009, with an expected attendance of 1000 people - over 5000 people attended on the day which is a clear indication of the level of support from the general public. The Eureka Council Executive has petitioned the local council using 'moral-force' persuasion, a style used by John Basson Humffray who headed up the Ballarat Reform League during the Eureka Stockade rebellion of 1854. Through this 'moral-force' approach, it is expected the decision will be reviewed and overturned by the local council.\n\nCurrently, the Eureka Council, through their Victorian Representative, is working with the Hepburn Shire Council on several gold history related projects. The Hepburn Shire Council encompasses the area to the north of Ballarat including the towns of Creswick, Clunes, Daylesford and Trentham. All these towns have a rich gold history with Clunes, Victoria taking the claim of being the place where gold was first discovered in Victoria. The projects involve such initiatives as storyboards at the New Australasian Mine No. 2 shaft, the scene of Australia's worst gold mining accident where in early December 1882, 22 men lost their lives when water broke through to where they were working from an adjacent mine. Other projects include creating a gold trail linking Geelong, Ballarat, Creswick, Clunes and Bendigo, as well as restoring the quartz crushing battery in Creswick.\n\n## Historical significance\n\nThe Eureka Council web site is indexed as \"a site of cultural and historical significance\" by the National Library of Australia, in Canberra.\n\n## External links\n\n* Official website\n\nCulture of Australia"}

He principally painted memorable scenes of the everyday life of the local fishermen.\n\n## Background\n\nGunnar Berg was born on Svinøya in Svolvær on Lofoten, Nordland County, Norway. He was the oldest of 12 siblings born to a wealthy landowner and merchant, Lars Thodal Walnum Berg (1830-–1903) and Lovise Johnsen (1842–1921). From 1875 until 1881, he attended Trondheim Cathedral School, and also took private lessons in drawing and painting by the artist H.J. Nicolaysen. He later attended a trade school in Bergen. He was first employed as a merchant. He later studied to become an artist.\n\n## Biography\n\nGunnar Berg first studied at the art academy in Düsseldorf, Germany. From 1883 until his death, Gunnar Berg studied and worked in Düsseldorf and Berlin, associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting. During the Lofoten fishing season, Berg was at home in Svolvær. With the help of his parents, built a studio on Svinøya. When he was at Lofoten, he had a good collaboration with fellow painter Otto Sinding.\n\nBerg painted scenes from his hometown including both landscapes and seascapes. Fishermen, mountains and the sea, during both summer and winter, comprised the primary themes of his artistry.\n\nAmong his most significant paintings are Fra Vaterfjord (1886) which is now on display at Svolvær City Hall and Trollfjordslaget (1890) which is situated in the Gunnar Berg Gallery in Svolvær. Fra Vaterfjord is dated to between 1886 and 1893. The painting features Nordland boats during a break in fishing. In the background is a steamship that is probably buying up fish for transport south.\n\nTrollfjordslaget depicts The Battle of Trollfjord which was fought in 1890. The Battle at Trollfjord (Slaget i Trollfjorden) was fought between the owners of large steamships and some Lofotfisherman over the control of local fishing.\n\nTrollfjordslaget was Gunnar Berg's last major work. In 1891 it was discovered that he had cancer in one leg that had to be amputated. His health was weakening and during the fall of 1893 he incurred pneumonia.\n\nGunnar Berg died in Berlin in 1893.

{"id": "55074456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death%20of%20Santiago%20Maldonado", "title": "Death of Santiago Maldonado", "text": "The Argentine activist Santiago Maldonado went missing after the Argentine National Gendarmerie dispersed a demonstration against the Benetton Group's activities in Cushamen Department, Chubut Province, Argentina, on 1 August 2017. Maldonado's body was found in October in the nearby Chubut River. The autopsy of the body indicated that Santiago's cause of death was \"drowning by immersion in the water of the Chubut River, contributed by hypothermia\", that there were no signs of violence, and that the body had stayed underwater for at least 55 days. In November, a commission of 55 forensic experts asserted that Maldonado died by asphyxia and hypothermia, and that there were no evidence of blows or injuries to his body. Maldonado's family continue to believe he was a victim of a forced disappearance.\n\n## The event\n\nSantiago Andrés Maldonado (born 25 July 1989) was a craftsman and tattoo artist from the town of Veinticinco de Mayo, province of Buenos Aires. A few months before his disappearance he had moved to El Bolsón, province of Río Negro, about 70 kilometers north of a Mapuche settlement named Cushamen. Maldonado supported the aboriginal communities in their land claims, but, according to his family, he was not an \"activist\" or \"militant\". His brother and a friend have described him as an anarchist.\n\nThe event took place on July 31 and August 1, 2017, at the Chubut Province. The location was the Pu Lof de la Resistencia of Cushamen, a mapuche establishment built in territories seized from the Italian clothing company Benetton Group by Facundo Jones Huala. Huala, member of the Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche group, was jailed because of the violent protest activities including destruction of properties that undertook in several locations, and members of the Pu Lof organized a picketing protest at the National Route 40, advocating for his liberation. The people in the demonstration were hooded, and had completely blocked the road with trees, stones and fire, thus not allowing any transit through the road. The protest was carried out by eight people, Santiago Maldonado among them. Judge Guido Otranto instructed the Argentine National Gendarmerie to clear the blockade and disperse the protesters, who escaped. The judge had also instructed them to use minimal violence, and film the operation on video.\n\nThe protesters tried to block the road again some hours later, on August 1. The protesters reacted violently to the Gendarmerie this time, and attacked them with stones. Commander Juan Pablo Escola reported that two gendarmes were gravely injured in their faces during the attack. He sent a group of 30 gendarmes to the Pu Lof. Although he did not have a judicial warrant to do so, he considered that the attack could be considered as in flagrante delicto, which would have allowed to skip that requirement.\n\nSome protesters attempted to escape by swimming across the Chubut River, and others tried to hide in a forest next to the river. Maldonado didn't know how to swim. The whereabouts of Santiago Maldonado were unknown after that point.\n\n## Judicial case\n\nA judicial case, led by a judge and three prosecutors, tries to determine the whereabouts of Maldonado. The national government and the provincial government of Chubut asked to be complainants in the case. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights suggested that, in case of doubt about a case being a forced disappearance or not, it should be investigated as if it was. In line with this suggestion, the Gendarmerie was removed from taking an active role in the investigation. The United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances has requested to oversee the investigation, which was accepted by Argentina. As a result, both the judiciary and the Argentine government will have to keep the organization updated about every progress of the investigation.\n\nThe case was initially investigated as a search and rescue, and was later rebranded as a forced disappearance. However, the change was made without any new evidence that may suggest an involvement of the Gendarmeria.\n\nA group of twenty mapuches occupied the court on September 20, asking for the removal of judge Otranto.\n\nThe Maldonado family and the Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS) accused the judge Otranto of not being an impartial jury. The federal chamber of appeals of Comodoro Rivadavia recused him from the case, but clarified in the sentence that they found no reason to doubt his intellectual honesty and respect to the procedures. He was recused instead because of an interview with the newspaper La Nación, where he made an extrajudicial commentary about the accuracy of the theories, before formally closing the case. Otranto was then replaced by judge Gustavo Llerald. The Maldonado family celebrated the removal of Otranto, but complained that their specific request had been rejected. Otranto is still in charge of the case over the road block that started the case.\n\nOn 21 October 2017, after a 12-hour autopsy involving 52 experts, including those appointed by Maldonado's family, Judge Gustavo Lleral confirmed that Maldonado's body did not have any signs of violence and the cause of death was established as death by drowning. On November 24, 2017, the verdict of the 55 experts confirmed that Maldonado drowned and that there were no signs of violence on his body. How, when and why he died is still on investigation.\n\nThe prosecutor Silvina Avila asked in December 2017 to change the folder of the case from forced disappearance to suspicious death, on the grounds that the investigation did not reveal any clue that may support the forced disappearance hypothesis. There was a similar request from the Ministry of Security in May 2018. The judge Lleral rejected both requests. He pointed that the folder of the case is inconsequential, that changing it before the case was closed would be an improper advance of opinion, and that the case is not guided by the folder's name but by the results of the investigations. There are no specific members of the gendarmerie formally accused of wrongdoing or called for inquiry, which turns it into a moot point.\n\n## International cases\n\nOn August 7, 2017, the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances expressed its \"concern about the physical and psychological integrity\" of Maldonado and requested the Argentine state to adopt \"a comprehensive search strategy\", taking \"all the urgent measures that are necessary to search for him and find him, taking into account the information provided by the members of the Pu Lof Mapuche community that were present at the moment of the repression\". The UN committee also requested that the Gendarmerie does not participate in the search and investigation of the disappearance and that the Argentine government protects all the evidence that may help to identify those responsible for the disappearance. The same day, the Minister of Security offered a reward to those who \"while not having participated in the crime, offer useful information that can help find the whereabouts\" of Maldonado.\n\nOn August 23, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), of the Organization of American States, also took a precautionary measure asking the Argentine state to \"adopt all the necessary measures to determine the situation and whereabouts of Mr. Santiago Maldonado\" and to \"inform about all the measures that have been adopted to investigate the facts\".\n\nOn October 6, the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances published a document addressed to the Argentine national government in which the former expresses its concern about the lack of progress in the clarification of what happened to Santiago Maldonado. The UN demanded the Macri administration to set as a priority the clarification of the role of the Gendarmerie and to keep this force away from the investigation. It also accused the authorities of quickly rejecting the hypothesis according to which the Gendarmerie is the perpetrator of the enforced disappearance of Maldonado. The Committee expressed its concern regarding the lack of partiality of judge Guido Otranto. It finally pointed out that there are officials of the Macri administration that continue to stigmatize the members of the Pu Lof by portraying them as a threat to national security, when the government should be instead offering protection to the Mapuche community.\n\nThe UN and the IACHR closed those cases in January 2018, two months after Maldonado's body was found. They found no evidence of foul play in the investigation.\n\n## Drowned\n\nEventually a corpse was found in the Chubut river on October 17. There were no reports of other deaths or missing people in the area, and it was confirmed that it was a male, with light blue clothes as those that witnesses reported that Maldonado was wearing. The corpse was found 300 meters upstream from the area of the events.\n\nThe presence of many aquatic plants and strong flow had made it extremely difficult to find the corpse sooner. The autopsy conducted on 21 October 2017 confirmed forensic evidence clearly pointed to drowning and hypothermia as the cause of death The autopsy, witnessed by 52 experts including that of the Maldonado family and international organizations, revealed no evidence of injuries. The corpse was acknowledged to be Maldonado's by the 52 experts witnessing the autopsy. On November 29, 2018, Judge Lleral closed the case citing no further evidence pointing towards anything different to an accidental drowning.\n\nThe accepted theory is that as Maldonado fled from the Gendarmerie he tried to hide in some bushes on the shore of the Chubut river hoping evade the security forces; no security officer or personnel came near him or even saw where he was hiding. Either Maldonado was waiting for the Gendarmerie to leave the area when the ground below him collapsed into the body of water or he presumably jumped into the river trying to rejoin with the others on the other side. The strong currents and Maldonado own heavy winter clothing sent him to the bottom of the river. As Maldonado did not know how to swim he panicked and failed to come up the surface. As the hypothermia set in, because of the cold water, he went into shock and drowned leaving his body submerge.\n\n## Maldonado's family reaction\n\nDespite the recovery of the body, the results of the autopsy and the lack of any evidence of foul play the Maldonado family insisted that the case was one of forced disappearance. They proposed that Santiago had been forcefully abducted and killed by the gendarmerie elsewhere and later his body dumped in the river. They claimed that the body had signs of cryopreservation, although the autopsy never provide any signs of this or even that the body had been manipulated in any way after death. This theory also could not provide an explanation as to how the body could have been dump without being immediately detected by local mapuches who were living on the adjacent areas.\n \nThe Maldonado family requested at least two more autopsies on the body. The judge rejected both requests. The judge claimed results of first one were clear and there was no point in performing further autopsies on the body. They also asked for several other investigations, that the judge systematically rejected them as extemporaneous, pointless and impossible to perform.\n\n## Forced disappearance\n\nFalse accounts of security forces detaining protestors were made. According to alleged witnesses, after the Lof protesters clashed with the Argentine National Gendarmerie, government agents were seen carrying somebody to a truck. Later those witnesses admitted to lying to the court and were charged with perjury. The Gendarmerie denies having ever detained Maldonado.\n\nThe witnesses made public comments, but refused to testify in court. They proposed to testify while concealing their identities and with hoods over their faces, which was rejected by the judiciary. Other witnesses told before justice that Maldonado was taken by Gendarmerie agents.\n\nEighty biological samples were retrieved from the vehicles used by the Gendarmerie during the operation, and used for a DNA test. The results were released a month later: none of them matched the DNA of Maldonado. The value of this evidence was disputed by a public defender, Fernando Machado, who argued that the samples could have been taken after the trucks had been washed, he never provided any evidence of this. The judge dismissed those concerns.\n\nThe prosecutor Silvina Avila made a report that established that there are no solid evidence that linked the Gendarmerie with Maldonado. As of September 17, the judge does stooped considering the theory of a forced disappearance as likely.\n\nAudio files from a WhatsApp conversations were submitted into evidence. One of the files, sent by a member of the gendarmeria, stated that a sergeant had \"Maldonado in a truck\" but further analysis revealed that the comment was made on August 16, several weeks after the protests, and was only a joke between members of the Gendarmerie Under court order over 70 cell phones from Gendarmerie officers were analyse during the investigation, none of them had been used to discuss any actual forced disappearance operation or provided any proof of wrongdoing.\n\nAriel Garzi, a fellow craftsman and friend from El Bolsón, claimed he called Santiago Maldonado's cellphone on August 2 and that call was answered by an unknown person. It lasted 22 seconds, during which Garzi heard the sound of steps. An engineer from the National Technological University, claimed he could triangulate the location where the phone was answered but needed a court order. The phone was later found in a house Santiago used to live in prior his death, presumably left behind by Santiago before going to the protest.\n\n## Received a mortal wound\n\nCommentators stipulated that Santiago might have received a mortal wound as he fled from the protest, which would have later caused his death. This was later proven false by the autopsy report\n\n## Hiding\n\nA theory considered that Maldonado was still alive, hiding in Mapuche territory. A search with search and rescue dogs conducted on August 16 suggested that he would have been in the area in the previous 24 hours.\n\nSome government official also considered the possibility that Maldonado may not have been in the protest to begin with. As all people in the protest were hooded, it was impossible to properly identify him in any photos or video of the event. The Maldonado family reported that he was a quiet and peaceful man, which would make it unlikely that he would take part in a violent protest in a road. The mapuches Beatriz Garay Neri, Soraya Noemí Guitart and Nicolás Jones Huala reported that they talked with him on August 1, in the morning, but did not provide further details about his presence at the protest, the topics the discussed together and admitted they did not know his full name.\n\n## Murder\n\nSantiago Maldonado used his cell phone for the last time on July 21, 2017. That day, four or five hooded members of the Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche forcefully invaded the small home of Evaristo Jones, a mapuche who worked for the Benetton family as a caretaker. Jones reported that he tried to defend himself by stabbing one of those people with a knife. As there were no cases of knife injuries treated in nearby hospitals on that day, or information about Maldonado's activities and whereabouts in the immediate days prior to the August 1 protest, it was proposed that he may have been the wounded assailant and that he had bled to death days before the protest.\n\nThe family of Maldonado tried to refute this theory by providing a video of another picketing protest of the RAM that took place on July 31, which would have been attended by Maldonado. They also provide testimonials from numerous people who saw Santiago after the supposed attack. In addition, Evaristo Jones, the attacked worker, denied knowing how badly he had injured his attackers. The Maldonado family also claimed that they had telephone conversations with Santiago on July 25, his birthday, and on July 27.\n\nDNA tests later ruled out that Santiago Maldonado was the assistant injured in the Evaristo Jones attack.\n\n## Reactions\n\nAccording to Argentinian sociologist Marcos Novaro, Kirchnerism and human rights organizations exploited the case to advance a political discourse against Macri. Treating the case like a forced disappearance allowed to draw comparisons between his government and the Dirty War that took place during the National Reorganization Process, in the 1970s. According to this narrative, Macri would have a covert plan to kidnap and kill demonstrators, the gendarmerie, the judiciary and the media would be working alongside Macri in such a plan, and Maldonado would be just the first victim of it. Human rights organizations had aligned themselves with the Kirchners during the government of both Néstor and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, even in topics unrelated to human rights, and often worked as their spokesmen. They kept this role since 2015, when Macri defeated Cristina Kirchner in the presidential elections. This, however, undermined their legitimacy in the Argentine society, as an increasingly portion of the population loses interest in the events of the 1970s, and their public image got tied to that of Cristina Kirchner.\n\nThe disappearance of Maldonado had also mobilized international human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In Buenos Aires, La Plata, Bariloche, Mar del Plata, Bahía Blanca, General Madariaga, Mendoza, Malargüe, El Bolsón, Rawson, Viedma, Gualeguaychú, Rosario and Neuquen thousands of people marched in demonstrations demanding that Maldonado appears alive and the resignation of Bullrich. People also marched to demand that Santiago Maldonado is brought back alive in Bogotá (Colombia), Asunción (Paraguay), Montevideo (Uruguay), Canelones and Fray Bentos (Uruguay). In Spain, several Argentine residents marched to Plaça de Catalunya to ask for Santiago Maldonado. On August 11, there was a large mass demonstration in Plaza de Mayo, Buenos Aires. On August 21, during the 49th ordinary session of PARLASUR, in Montevideo, Argentine representatives condemned the disappearance of Santiago Maldonado.\n\nThe disappearance of Maldonado took place shortly before the 2017 midterm elections. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, leader of one of the opposition parties, mentioned the case repeatedly during her rallies. The corpse of Maldonado was found a few days before the elections. By the time of voting, the Maldonado family had confirmed his identity and the initial autopsy revealed no signs of violence against the body; the official results of the full autopsy would be released a pair of weeks later.\n\nAugust 30 is the International Day of the Disappeared, and several teachers affiliated to the CTERA union mentioned the event during school classes. This action was rejected by groups of parents because it described the involvement of the Gendarmerie as a confirmed fact, and it was considered a case of political indoctrination.\n\nThe Macri administration first negated the disappearance of Maldonado. As the days went by, members of Mr. Macri's cabinet send contradictory messages.\n\nOn September 1, 2017, a month after Santiago Maldonado's disappearance, thousands of people expressed themselves through rallies and demonstrations asking for his appearance alive. The largest demonstration took place in Plaza de Mayo and was organized by Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo (Línea Fundadora), Relatives of the Disappeared and Imprisoned for Political Reasons, HIJOS, the Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS), the Argentine League for the Rights of Man, and the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, among other organizations. In other cities, such as Mendoza, Mar del Plata, San Luis, San Juan, Neuquén, Salta, Posadas, Jujuy, Santiago del Estero, Villaguay, Concepción del Uruguay, Gualeguaychú and Concordia there were rallies and demonstrations with the same demand. In Rosario and Córdoba there were rallies with an attendance of 40000 each. There were also protests in Spain, Brazil, France, Uruguay, Chile, Mexico, Austria and the United States which were organized through social media. In London, São Paulo and Madrid, groups of people expressed their solidarity with the demand for the appearance of Santiago Maldonado alive.\n\n## See also\n \n\n* El camino de Santiago\n\n* Death of Camilo Catrillanca\n\n* List of solved missing person cases\n\n* Anarchism in Argentina\n\n## External links\n\n* Dirección general de registro de personas desaparecidas \n\n* Official site \n\n2010s missing person cases\n2017 in Argentina\nDeath conspiracy theories\nDeaths by drowning\nDeaths by person in Argentina\nFormerly missing people\nMapuche conflict\nMissing person cases in Argentina\nAnarchism in Argentina"}

{"id": "27124538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacopsis", "title": "Phacopsis", "text": "Phacopsis is a genus of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi. They are parasites of members of the large lichen family Parmeliaceae, of which they are also a member. Originally proposed by Edmond Tulasne in 1852 to contain 3 species, Phacopsis now contains 10 species, although historically, 33 taxa have been described in the genus. Many of the species are poorly known, some of them having been documented only from the type specimen.\n\nPhacopsis species appear as partially immersed, shiny brown to black apothecia that cause gall-like deformations on the thallus of the host lichen. Features of Phacopsis used to distinguish species from each other include the shape of their spores, and the colour and reaction of the hypothecium (a tissue layer under the spore-bearing hymenium) when stained using an iodine–starch test. Since Phacopsis fungi are usually restricted to living on hosts belonging to a single phylogenetic clade, the identity of the host lichen is another diagnostic character used to identify species.\n\n## Systematics\n\nPhacopsis was circumscribed by French mycologist Edmond Tulasne in 1852 with multiple species originally classified in genus Abrothallus. Tulasne included three species: P. clemens, P. varia, and P. vulpina. The last-mentioned species was later selected as the type species by Frederic Clements and Cornelius Shear (1931), and by John Axel Nannfeldt (1932). Of the other two species originally included in Phacopsis by Tulasne, P. clemens has since been referred to the genus Arthonia, while P. varia is now known as Opegrapha physciaria.\n\nIn 1988, Dagmar Triebel and Gerhard Rambold proposed that Phacopsis should be considered synonymous with Nesolechia (another genus of lichenicolous fungi in the Parmeliaceae), owing to similarities both in the structure of their apothecia and the characteristics of their hymenia. This proposed synonymy, however, was not accepted by several authors in the years following, until 1995 when Triebel, Rambold, and John Elix showed that the supposed differences that separated the two genera were not consistent. Following this, Ove Eriksson and David L. Hawksworth used an expanded generic concept of Phacopsis (sensu lato) in the next update of their regular publication on ascomycete systematics, Systema Ascomycetum.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic analysis published in 2015 demonstrated that the group of species then considered to be members of Phacopsis actually comprised three distinct lineages, representing three genera: Phacopsis, Nesolechia, and the newly circumscribed Raesaenenia. In 2017, Divakar and colleagues used a then-recently developed \"temporal phylogenetic\" approach in an attempt to make family- and genus-level classification more consistent with evolutionary history. They proposed to synonymize genus Nesolechia with Punctelia, and Raesaenenia with Protousnea, because the lichenicolous genera originated relatively recently and fell under the timeframe threshold for genus level. This proposed synonymy was not accepted in a later critical analysis of the temporal phylogenetic approach for fungal classification. In a 2018 review of taxonomic developments in the family Parmeliaceae, the authors recommended not synonymizing Nesolechia and Phacopsis, suggesting that the separation between these two genera has not yet been sufficiently established.\n\nThe higher-level classification of Phacopsis has changed several times in its taxonomic history. It has been placed in the order Arthoniales, in the families Graphidaceae, and the Acarosporaceae. Using electron microscopy, Josef Hafellner examined the asci (spore-bearing cells) of the type species P. vulpina, showing them to be similar to those commonly found in members of the Lecanoraceae, and so he considered the genus most appropriately classified in this family. This familial placement, however, was not corroborated in Triebel and colleagues' 1995 review and revision of the genus. Molecular phylogenetic analysis eventually revealed its true phylogenetic placement in the family Parmeliaceae. This relationship is an example of adelpho-parasitism, in which the host species is closely related to the parasite; this type of relationship is fairly common in the Lecanorales. The genus Protousnea has a sister taxon relationship with Phacopsis. It has been estimated that the lichenicolous Phacopsis diverged evolutionarily from the lichen-forming Protousnea during the Miocene (23.03 to 5.333 mya).\n\n## Description\n\nAll species are endokapylic, meaning they possess a thallus in which no morphologically distinct lichenized structure is formed. Their apothecia are circular to irregular in shape, and may be dispersed or aggregated. The excipulum (the outer margin of the apothecium) range from colourless to blackish-brown, and often comprises \"a few rows of cells which may be difficult to recognize\". The hypothecium (a layer of dense hyphal tissue just below the hymenium) is colourless to blackish-brown. In some species, the hyphae in the hypothecium have a violet staining reaction with an iodine–starch test; this characteristic can be used to distinguish between some species. The hymenium is colourless, pale brownish, or pale olivaceous. Asci are more or less club-shaped, and contain eight spores. They are surrounded by a thin outer amyloid wall layer and a thicker, non-amyloid inner wall layer; a non-amyloid zone rests above the axial body of the ascus.\n\nThe ascospores are colourless, lack septa, and have smooth walls with occasional thickening at either end. The spores have a range of shapes; depending on the species, the following shapes have been recorded: ellipsoid, ovoid (egg-shaped), fusiform (spindle-shaped), lemon-shaped, falciform (sickle-shaped), fabiform (bean-shaped), and partly curved. The pycnidia of Phacopsis are immersed in the thallus of the host. Pycnospores have a bacilliform shape.\n\n## Distribution\n\nMembers of the host family, Parmeliaceae, are found worldwide and the family has centres of distribution in Asia and in the Southern Hemisphere; Phacopsis probably occurs wherever the host does. A 1995 survey of Phacopsis accepted 13 taxa (eight species and several varieties) found on 41 host species on 20 genera. Little is known about several Phacopsis species, and some have only been found at their type locality. The most southernly distributed member of the genus is Phacopsis usneae, known to occur only in southern Chile and Antarctica.\n\nLike many lichenicolous fungi, Phacopsis species are usually restricted to living on a host belong to a single phylogenetic clade. In 2002, André Aptroot and Triebel suggested a possible close phylogenetic relationship between Paraparmelia and Xanthoparmelia, since Phacopsis australis was noted to grow on representatives from both of those lichen genera. Since then, molecular phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that they are equivalent, and Paraparmelia is now placed in synonymy with Xanthoparmelia.\n\n## Species\n\nPhacopsis species are distinguished from each other by the characteristics of their ascospores, the colour and amyloid reaction of the hypothecium, and the identity of their host. According to Index Fungorum, 33 taxa have been described under the name Phacopsis (28 species and 5 varieties). A recent (2022) estimate places 10 species in genus Phacopsis. The following list of Phacopsis species indicates its name, taxonomic authority (standard abbreviations are used) and year of publication, type locality, and host species (or genus).\n\n* Phacopsis australis – southern Africa; host=Xanthoparmelia\n\n* Phacopsis cephalodioides – Denmark; host=Hypogymnia physodes\n\n* Phacopsis lethariellae – Canary Islands; host=Lethariella intricata\n\n* Phacopsis oroarcticae – Severnaya Zemlya; host=Brodoa oroarctica\n\n* Phacopsis prolificans – Japan; host=Platismatia interrupta\n\n* Phacopsis rufa – Australia; hosts=Cetrelia and Punctelia\n\n* Phacopsis thallicola – New Zealand; hosts=Cetrelia sanguinea, Flavoparmelia caperata, Flavoparmelia praesignis, Parmotrema eurysacum, Rimelia cetraria\n\n* Phacopsis usneae – Kerguelen Islands; host=Usnea trachycarpa\n\n* Phacopsis vulpicidae – Renchinlkhümbe (Mongolia); host=Vulpicida\n\n* Phacopsis vulpina – France; host=Letharia\n\nIn 1995, Triebel and colleagues described Phacopsis menegazziae for a Nepalese fungus similar to Phacopsis oxyspora, but with smaller spore dimensions and growing on the host Menegazzia terebrata. Paul Diederich synonymised P. menegazziae with P. oxyspora in 2003, based on specimens he found growing on Menegazzia with ascospores similar in size to typical P. oxyspora. Phacopsis oxyspora is now Nesolechia oxyspora , the type species of Nesolechia.\n\nSeveral species formerly placed in Phacopsis have since been transferred to other genera. These include:\n\n* Phacopsis crustulosae now Gyrophthorus crustulosae \n\n* Phacopsis doerfeltii now Nesolechia doerfeltii \n\n* Phacopsis ericetorum now Rhymbocarpus ericetorum \n\n* Phacopsis falcispora now Nesolechia falcispora \n\n* Phacopsis huuskonenii now Raesaenenia huuskonenii \n\n* Phacopsis lesdainii now Echinodiscus lesdainii \n\n* Phacopsis macrospora now Cercidospora macrospora \n\n* Phacopsis muelleri now Calloria muelleri \n\n* Phacopsis mulleri now Skyttella mulleri\n\n## References\n\nParmeliaceae\nLecanorales genera\nLichenicolous fungi\nTaxa described in 1852\nTaxa named by Edmond Tulasne"}
{"id": "25219833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared%20transport", "title": "Shared transport", "text": "Shared transport or shared mobility is a transportation system where travelers share a vehicle either simultaneously as a group (e.g. ride-sharing) or over time (e.g. carsharing or bike sharing) as personal rental, and in the process share the cost of the journey. It is a transportation strategy that allows users to access transportation services on an as-needed basis, and can be regarded as a hybrid between private vehicle use and mass or public transport. Shared mobility is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of transportation modes including carsharing, Bicycle-sharing systems, ridesharing companies, carpools, and microtransit.\n\nEach shared mobility service has unique attributes that have a range of impacts on travel behavior, the environment, and the development of cities and urban areas. Some impacts of shared mobility include enhanced transportation accessibility as well as reduced driving and decreased personal vehicle ownership.\nShared mobility programs often yield a variety of environmental, social, and transportation system benefits. These are primarily related to personal vehicle usage and ownership, and vehicle miles or kilometers traveled (VMT/VKT). Shared mobility networks also retain the potential to expand the reach of public transportation by addressed gaps in existing public transportation systems. They can also provide economic benefits to users in the form of cost savings in some cases.\n\nShared transport systems include carsharing (also called car clubs in the UK), bicycle sharing (also known as PBS or public bicycle systems), carpools and vanpools (aka ride-sharing or lift-sharing), real-time ridesharing, slugging (casual carpooling), community buses and vans, demand responsive transit (DRT), paratransit, a range of taxi projects and even hitchhiking and its numerous variants.\n\nShared transport is taking on increasing importance as a key strategy for reducing greenhouse gas and other emissions from the transport sector in the face of the global climate emergency by finding ways of getting more intensive use of vehicles on the road. Together with other emerging automotive technologies such as vehicle electrification, connected vehicles and autonomous driving, shared transports form a future mobility vision called Connected, Autonomous, Shared and Electric (CASE) Mobility. \n\nA somewhat different form of shared transport is the \"shared taxi\", a vehicle which follows a predetermined route and takes anybody waiting for it, more like a bus than a taxi.\n\n## History\n\nShared mobility is a subgroup of the larger sharing economy. The sharing economy is a term that encompasses a wide variety of services, usually involving the online transactions of goods or services as part of a peer-to-peer marketplace. Innovations in social networking, location-based services, and Internet technologies have enabled shared mobility to develop and expand rapidly. By improving efficiency, providing cost savings, and monetizing underused resources, shared mobility services have become widely used in many cities around the world. Although the proliferation of tech-enabled shared mobility has occurred mostly within the last decade, shared mobility services are not a new phenomenon. The first carsharing program was established in 1948 in Zurich, Switzerland, and the first bikesharing program began in 1965 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\nSmartphone applications and location data have increased the feasibility of shared transportation services, including carsharing companies and mobile app-based vehicle for hire companies.\n\n## Auto rickshaws\n\nAuto rickshaws carry people and goods in many developing countries. Also known as a three-wheeler, Samosa, tempo, tuk-tuk, trishaw, auto, rickshaw, autorick, bajaj, rick, tricycle, mototaxi, baby taxi or lapa in popular parlance, they are motorized version of the traditional pulled rickshaw or cycle rickshaw. They are an essential form of urban transport, both as vehicles for hire and for private use, in many developing countries, and a form of novelty transport in many Eastern countries.\n\n## Bikesharing\n\nBicycle-sharing systems allow users to access and use a shared fleet of bicycles, typically located within a given spatial boundary. These systems are mostly concentrated in cities or other urban areas and bikes or stations are normally unattended and always accessible. This availability during most or all of the day makes bikesharing an on-demand mobility option.\n\nThe first bikesharing system debuted in Amsterdam in 1965, under the name ‘White Bikes.’ The bicycles were left unlocked around the city to be used by anyone in need of transportation. Bikesharing systems have since exploded in popularity starting in the mid-2000s due to advances in information technology (IT) that have improved bikesharing communications and tracking. As of April 2016, there were 99 U.S. cities with technology-enabled public bikesharing systems, with approximately 32,200 bikes and 3,400 stations.\n\nThree major types of bikesharing systems have emerged: public bikesharing (docked and dockless/free floating), closed campus bikesharing and peer-to-peer (P2P) bikesharing. Most bikesharing systems are public and allow anyone to access a bicycle for a fee, typically in daily, monthly or annual membership fees. Public bikesharing programs can be station-based (docked), or dockless (also known as free floating). Dockless systems are deployed within a geo-fenced area. Dockless systems were first introduced in Germany in the early 2000s via the Call a Bike program. Major bikesharing operators in North America include: Motivate, Social Bicycles, Spin, ofo, Mobike, and LimeBike. E-bikesharing systems (or Pedlec) have also been growing in popularity, particularly in Europe. Social Bicycles began testing an e-bikesharing program, called Jump, in San Francisco in Summer 2017.\nStudies have been conducted that analyze bikesharing impacts on modal shift. A 2014 UC Berkeley study suggests that in larger cities, bikesharing programs remove riders from crowded or high-use bus transit systems. In smaller cities, bikesharing improves access from bus lines, filling in gaps in the public transit system. In addition, those living in larger cities report decreased rail usage as a result of increased cost savings and reduced travel times. The study also found that half of the bikesharing members surveyed reduced their personal vehicle usage due to bikesharing.\n\n## Carsharing\n\nCarsharing refers to a model of vehicle sharing where users access cars on an as-needed basis, and often pay by time of reservation or miles driven. As of January 2015, there were 23 carsharing operators in the U.S. amounting to over 1.1 million members and over 16,000 vehicles. As of January 2017, there were 39 carsharing organizations in North America serving 1.9 million members with a collective fleet of 24,629 vehicles. (these numbers do not include P2P carsharing; they include roundtrip and one-way carsharing operations.).\n\n## Roundtrip carsharing\n\nRoundtrip carsharing is one of the earliest carsharing models, granting members access to a shared vehicle fleet. As the name suggests, roundtrip carsharing requires users to return to the same location where they accessed the vehicle.\nOne of the largest North American-based roundtrip carsharing operators is Zipcar, which operates more than 12,000 vehicles in urban areas on college campuses and at airports across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Belgium, Turkey and Taiwan. There have been numerous studies that document behavioral changes associated with roundtrip carsharing programs. A 2004 study on City CarShare in San Francisco, CA found that nearly 30% of members reduced car ownership by one of more cars; two-thirds of members reported that they opted not to purchase an additional vehicle. This reduced car ownership typically translates into reduced driving, and thus lowered energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Carsharing programs also affect usage patterns of other travel modes. A 2011 study by UC Berkeley researchers found that roundtrip carsharing has a mixed impact on public transit and non-motorized modal use, with the same proportion of respondents increasing and decreasing usage of these modes. The impact on carpooling and non-motorized transportation, however, was found to be positive. The same study documented a 27% to 43% reduction in vehicle miles traveled and a 34% to 41% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions among households due to roundtrip carsharing.\n\n## One-way carsharing\n\nOne-way carsharing varies from roundtrip carsharing in that it grants members more flexibility in pickup and dropoff location. In one-way carsharing—also known as point-to-point carsharing—members can access a vehicle at one location and end their trip in another location. As of September 2015, companies that offered one-way functionality in the U.S. include car2go, GIG, ReachNow, Zipcar, and BlueIndy. As of January 2015, about 35% of North American carsharing fleets were one-way capable.\nA 2016 study of one-way carsharing operator, car2go, in five North American cities found that 2% to 5% of members sold a vehicle, and 7% to 10% postponed a vehicle purchase due to their carsharing membership. Moreover, estimated VMT impacts due to carsharing ranged from −6% to −16% per car2go household, and GHG emissions changed by −4% to −18%.\n\n## Personal vehicle sharing (PVS) and P2P carsharing\n\nPersonal vehicle sharing (PVS) is a carsharing service model that allows short-term access to privately owned vehicles. P2P carsharing, a subset of PVS, employs privately owned vehicles made available for shared usage by members of a P2P member base. P2P carsharing companies differ from other carsharing operators in that users provide the free-floating vehicle fleet using their personally owned vehicles. P2P carsharing operators in North America include Getaround and Turo (formerly RelayRides), and as of May 2015, there were eight active P2P operators in North America.\nOne 2014 study found that the top three reasons for using P2P carsharing are convenience and availability, monetary savings, and expanded mobility options. Another study documented that personal vehicle sharing services can expand the geographic range of vehicle sharing services by renting underused autos and therefore lowering vehicle usage requirements. However, fear of sharing personal assets was cited as one of the primary barriers to the adoption of P2P sharing services.\n\n## Ridesharing\n\nRidesharing services enable shared rides between drivers and passengers that have similar origins and destination pairings. Ridesharing includes both vanpooling and carpooling. Vanpooling involves a grouping of between seven and 15 people traveling in a van, and carpooling refers to groups of less than seven people traveling together in one vehicle.\nRidesharing is distinct from ridesourcing (or TNCs), like Uber and Lyft in that the driver typically decides trip origin, destination, and any deviations to accommodate one or more additional passengers. Drivers and riders have the same origin, destination, or potentially share multiple proximate destinations, with a common purpose of conserving resources, saving money, or saving time. Driver earnings from ridesharing are regulated in the U.S. by the Internal Revenue Service, and as of January 2017, they were capped at 53.5 cents per mile for business travel by car.\nBoth technology-enabled ridesharing organizations and more informal ridesharing programs exist. Examples of technology-enabled ridesharing companies are BlaBlaCar, Carma Carpool, Scoop, and Waze Carpool. These services usually require participants to join either through a membership, website, or mobile application. Potential drivers and riders can then post driving routes or preferred travel routes and the ridesharing service will connect riders with passengers that share similar origin destination pairings. More informal ad hoc ridesharing programs include slugging (also known as casual carpooling). Casual carpooling is an informal form of commuter ridesharing operating in Washington, D.C.; Houston, Texas; and San Francisco, California.\nCasual carpooling has been in existence for over 30 years, is entirely run informally by its users, and does not use a mobile application or information communication technology. In one study in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2014, researchers interviewed, observed, and surveyed participants at multiple casual carpooling locations. The study found that motivations for casual carpooling participation include: convenience, time savings, and monetary savings, while environmental and community-based motivations ranked low. Casual carpooling is an efficient transportation option for these commuters, while environmental sustainability benefits are a positive byproduct. Seventy-five percent of casual carpool users were previously public transit riders, and over 10% formerly drove alone.\nIn the U.S., the modal share of ridesharing has declined since the 1970s. In 1970, The U.S. Census found that about 20% of American workers commuted to work by carpool. The American Community Survey has found that the carpooling modal share has declined to around nine percent as of 2013, though it still remains the second most popular mode of travel in the U.S., next to driving alone.\n\n## On-demand ride services\n\nOn-demand ride services include ridehailing, ridesplitting, and E-hail for taxis. They are services that provide rides on-demand, usually in passenger cars, for a fee.\n\n## On-demand vehicle for hire\n\n\"Transportation network company\" is a regulatory classification coined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 2013, and it has been subsequently used by other U.S. states to refer to services like Lyft and Uber. These include point-to-point on-demand rides, typically hailed, coordinated, and paid for via smartphone and from drivers using their own personal vehicles. Transportation experts have called these services \"ridesourcing\" or \"ridehailing\" to distinguish these services from ridesharing and to clarify that drivers do not share a destination with their passengers. Ridehailing companies have spread around the world and include: Uber, Lyft, Ola Cabs, DiDi, Grab, Gett, Cabify, Careem, Easy Taxi, and Fasten, among others. As of August 2017, 2 million people drive for Uber every week. \n\nThese companies have faced criticism for adversely impacting traffic congestion, the environment, and public safety. A study of ridehailing users in San Francisco in 2014 evaluated modal shifts due to ridehailing and found that, if ridehailing were unavailable, 39% of respondents would have taken a taxi and 33% would have used a form of public transit. Four percent entered a public transit station as their origin or destination, suggesting ridehailing may serve as a first-/last-mile trip to or from public transit in some cases. Another study of ridehailing users in Denver and Boulder, Colorado found that a third of respondents would have taken public transit, biked, or walked instead of using a ridehailing service. Another third would have driven in a personal vehicle, and 12% would not have made the trip. These city-specific differences suggest that travel behavior impacts due to these services could be dependent on location. Only New York City and San Francisco have studied the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) implications of ridehailing services. Both studies found that Uber and Lyft are increasing VMT, with the heaviest impacts seen in some of the busiest areas of each city. However, both of these studies do not take into consideration modal shift changes.\n\n## Ridesplitting\n\nRidesplitting involves splitting both a ride and fare in a vehicle with others traveling in the same general direction. These services allow dynamic matching and route variation in real time as passengers request pickups. The user cost of ridesplitting services is lower than the cost of regular ridesourcing services, since the riders are sharing one ride and splitting the associated costs. Yet, ridesplitting may lead to detour and inconvenience effects for the users. Ridesplitting services are generally only available as an option in cities with denser and more established ridesourcing markets. Ridesplitting is even less studied than ridesourcing, and therefore travel behavior impacts are not yet well understood.\n\n## E-Hail services\n\nE-Hail services are a mode of transportation by which taxis can be reserved via Internet or mobile phone applications maintained by either a third-party provider or the taxi company. Examples of e-Hail services include Curb, Flywheel, Arro, Hailo, and iTaxi. In response to competition from ridesourcing companies, e-Hail taxi services have experienced rapid growth. As of October 2014, 80% of San Francisco taxis reported using Flywheel, an e-Hail app. As of February 2015, Flywheel was active in six cities, and Curb was active in about 60 U.S. cities. Since they use taxis, e-Hail services charge local taxi rates and do not use demand-based pricing during periods of higher ride demand, as ridesourcing services often do.\n\n## Microtransit\n\nMicrotransit is a technology-enabled private transit service that often uses shuttles or vans and is characterized by flexible scheduling, flexible routing, or both. Current microtransit operators include Chariot (acquired by Ford in September 2016) and Via. Defunct operators include Bridj and Leap Transit. Two forms of microtransit have emerged, including fixed-route with fixed-schedule services and flexible-route with on-demand scheduling. Chariot, which started in San Francisco and now operates in Austin, New York, and Seattle, functions similarly to public transit and runs 15-seater vans along pre-determined routes. Chariot determines new routes by “crowdsourcing” potential customer demand and then launching a new route once enough demand is indicated. Via is an example of flexible route, on-demand microtransit and currently operates in New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago. In New York City, users request a ride using Via's app and a shared van will pick them up with other travelers heading in a similar direction. The service is dynamic, without static routes, and shifts routes based on expected traffic and rider demand. Via charges a fare of $5 to $7 per ride in New York City, depending on the method of booking. Both Chariot and Via conform to the IRS “transit pass” standard, allowing them to qualify for pre-tax commuter benefits.\n\nMicrotransit services have also gained interest among some public transit operators, who see the technology as an opportunity to provide higher quality or more flexible public transit services to their users. In some instances, like the (now defunct) RideKC: Bridj pilot project in Kansas City, Missouri, public-private partnerships have been formed to provide microtransit services. The RideKC: Bridj pilot ultimately ceased operations as it failed to attract enough riders, with only nine percent of riders taking more than 10 trips. The lack of a targeted marketing campaign, relatively high vehicle ownership rates in Kansas City, and low existing public transit mode share in the city were possible reasons for the low ridership of the pilot project. Public-private microtransit partnerships have the potential to improve service and increase public transit ridership, but steps must be taken to appropriately evaluate demand for the service before launching.\n\n## Courier network services\n\nCourier Network Services (CNS) provide delivery services of packages, food, and other items for compensation using their own transportation and are connected with shippers and customers through an online app or platform. In P2P delivery services, someone who signs up and is approved by the platform can use their own vehicle or bicycle to conduct a delivery. There are many business models within P2P delivery services. Postmates couriers make deliveries using their own bicycles, scooters, or cars. They charge a delivery fee plus a service charge of nine percent of the value of the goods being delivered. Instacart delivers groceries for a $4 to $10 fee, depending on how long the delivery takes to complete. The proliferation of these services, where couriers use their personally owned vehicles or bicycles, could reduce the need for delivery companies to maintain and own their own delivery fleet.\nSome CNS models that have emerged also incorporate on-demand ride services (e.g., TNCs) that deliver packages. CNS deliveries are either made in separate trips or in multiple-purpose trips that may also serve passengers simultaneously. Sidecar and Uber have incorporated passenger, food delivery, and package delivery services.\n\n## Scootersharing\n\nScootersharing is a recent application of the sharing economy within the transportation space. Scootersharing companies took inspiration from the fourth generation bikesharing strategy, but replaced bicycles with GPS-tracked electric scooters. These scooters are also “dockless”, and are dropped off and picked up from any location within an urban area.\n\nDue to the lower speed of scooters and their electric assistance, it is easier for commuters to use them and for companies to invest in a fleet of them. Many scootersharing companies have been founded in the past few years. This includes Bird, Lime, Bolt, Skip, Scoot Networks, and Spin.\n\nBecause of its growing popularity, some cities have also looked to ban certain scootersharing companies, taking on similar strategies to ridesharing bans. In San Francisco, the city created a Powered Scooter Share Permit Program that limits the number of companies that could operate scooters, and the amount of scooters. Cities that enforced similar regulations cite how scooters are more commonly ridden on sidewalks instead of bike lanes and could injure pedestrians. Other reasons would also be the lack of these companies enforcing riders to wear safety gear such as helmets.\n\nCompared to the other forms of shared mobility, scootersharing can be more hyper-localized and can hypothetically better address the last mile problem. Because scootersharing does not have much market adoption right now because it is a new form of transportation, there are no academic studies that can effectively measure its impact. Overall, it provides urban mobility with fewer carbon emissions compared to automobiles. They take up less space than bikes, so they have potential to increase transit ridership to and from bus lines.\n\n## Enabling technology: smartphone apps\n\nSmartphones represent one of the most important transportation innovations of the 21st century. A variety of factors are changing the way people think about mobility including: demographic shifts, advancements in geo-spatial routing and computing power, the use of cloud technologies, faster wireless networks capable of carrying greater bandwidth, congestion, and heightened awareness about the environment and climate change. Mobility consumers are increasingly using smartphone applications, dubbed “apps” for an array of transportation use cases. More people are starting their trips with smartphones to plan routes, seek departure information for the next bus or railcar, find a taxi via an e-Hail app, or source a private driver through services, such as Lyft or Uber. Some factors driving transportation app growth are time savings; financial savings; incentives; and gamification.\n\n## Future of shared mobility and automation\n\nSelf-driving cars, in conjunction with shared mobility, have the potential to greatly increase the viability and user base of shared transportation services in the future. There has been great interest in the idea of shared automated vehicle (SAV) services in recent years. This interest is likely due to the highly publicized AV development space, as well as the popularity of ridesourcing services and the realization that operating cost per mile of mobility services may substantially decrease compared to current prices, with automation. Many experts, companies, public agencies, and universities are at the initial stages of exploring the potential impacts of SAVs.\n\nA few pilots have launched involving ridesourcing services and automated vehicles. Uber began testing an AV service open to frequent customers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in September 2016. Waymo (formerly Google's Self-Driving Car Project) has been testing an autonomous vehicle ride service in Arizona. Also during September 2016 in Singapore, nuTonomy and Grab partnered to offer a similar AV ridesourcing service in a business district called “One North.” These SAV services require an engineer to closely monitor the system at all times. There have also been several automated shuttle service pilots around the world, although all are in the initial testing phase and operate in a low-speed setting. Low-speed SAV shuttle companies include: EasyMile EZ10, Local Motors, Auro, and Navya SAS.\n\nThe impact that SAV services may have on travel behavior, other transportation modes, the environment, and cities in general remains uncertain. As real-world deployment of SAVs has been extremely limited, most studies on the subject develop or modify existing models of travel behavior and include SAVs, with assumptions regarding their operations and vehicle types. Studies predict a modal shift away from private vehicle trips due to SAVs under certain sharing scenarios. The impact SAV services may have on VMT and congestion is uncertain as well, with some studies predicting that roadway capacity may be freed up due to more efficient operations and right-sizing of vehicles.\n\n## Shared transport modes\n\n* Real-time ridesharing\n\n* Flexible carpooling\n\n* Green travel\n\n* Hail and ride\n\n* High-occupancy vehicle lanes\n\n* Hitchhiking\n\n* Slugging\n\n* The commons\n\n* Truck sharing\n\n* Vanpooling\n\n## Group travel\n\n* Carpooling (ride sharing)\n\n* Demand responsive transport\n\n* Paratransit\n\n* Share taxi\n\n## Rental travel\n\n* Bicycle-sharing system\n\n* Carsharing\n\n## External links\n\n* World Share/Transport Forum\n\n* The Commons: Open Society Sustainability Initiative \n\n* On the Commons\n\n* The first World Share/Transport Forum convened in Kaohsiung in September 2010\n\n* Avego\n\n \nPublic transport\nPrivate transport"}

{"id": "23610931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampuchea%20Krom", "title": "Kampuchea Krom", "text": "Kampuchea Krom (, ; \"Lower Cambodia\") is the region variously known as Southern Vietnam, Nam Bo, and the former French Cochinchina. Bordering present-day Cambodia, the region is positioned in Cambodian irredentist narratives as a \"once-integral part of the Khmer kingdom that was colonised by France as Cochinchina in the mid-nineteenth century and then ceded to Vietnam in June 1949\". This narrative persists despite historical cessations to the ruling Nguyễn Lords of the period, with the latest one occurring in 1770. In the present day, the region roughly corresponds to the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam.\n\nKampuchea Krom continues to be home to many ethnic Khmer Krom, with some Khmer estimating their numbers to be between seven million and over ten million, despite the government's census of the population of Khmer Krom in Vietnam at 1.32 millions by 2019. It’s a hope that a rough of ten of millions would receive their freedoms as they are fighting hard at the UN. The Khmer term \"Kampuchea Krom\" can be translated as \"Lower Cambodia\". An alternative name for the region is \"Kampuchea Lech Tuek\" ( ), which roughly corresponds to \"Flooded Cambodia\".\n\n## Territorial history\n\nIn a Khmer Buddhist monk's vision, the Khmer have inhabited the land of Kampuchea Krom since it first emerged from the ocean thousands of years ago as a fragrant and glowing land that attracted the teovada, celestial beings who ate the sweet earth and were subsequently unable to fly back to their world, thus staying on earth as the first humans. Throughout history, the area known in Khmer as Kampuchea Krom has been situated within numerous ancient polities, including Nokor Phnom (Funan), Chenla, and the Khmer Empire.\n\n## Ancient civilizations\n\nArchaeological research at the Óc Eo site between Rạch Giá and Long Xuyên in present South Vietnam dates Vietnamese incursion in the region to the sixteenth century, prior to which the area was located within the ancient Khmer empire. There is no clear consensus on the ethnic makeup of those living within the region during the earlier Funan and Chenla polities. Linguistic evidence from the period - by way of inscriptions - supports the theory that inhabitants spoke a pre-Khmer Austronesian language. However, archaeologists and historians also contend that this language may have been similar to Khmer, and that a version of Old Khmer may have been used by the end of the Funan period. A further theory is that ethnic distribution within the region may have varied with elevation within the landscape, with Khmer speakers living on higher ground, and Malayo-Polynesian - and later Vietnamese - speakers occupying the lower-lying areas.\n\n## 17th–19th-century Vietnamese expansion\n\nThe period spanning the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries saw an unprecedented expansion of the Vietnamese state into Kampuchea Krom. Historian Barbara Andaya identifies Vietnamese internal feuding and the Trịnh–Nguyễn Civil War of the early seventeenth century as motivating the dispersal of the Vietnamese population into Khmer speaking areas. In particular, Khmer sources note that Vietnamese immigrants flooded into the regions of Prey Nokor (known as the present-day Ho Chi Minh City), Baria, and Daun Nay (Kampong Sroka Trei), following requests by Vietnamese missionaries to King Chey Chettha (1618–1628).\n\nFollowing the fall of the Ming dynasty in the mid-seventeenth century, Ming loyalists began to migrate across East and Southeast Asia, including towards Kampuchea Krom. Historian Claudine Ang argues that this migration of Ming loyalists into the Mekong delta, or Kampuchea Krom, and their alliance with the southern Vietnamese rather than the Khmer or the Siamese, \"gave the Nguyễn lords of the southern Vietnamese state the support that they needed to lay claims on the delta lands\", enabling the aggressive southward territorial expansion of the Nguyễn lords in the mid-eighteenth century.\n\nHowever, it was only after the 1809 death of Mạc Tử Thiêm, whose father Mạc Cửu had arrived in Kampuchea Krom after leaving China following the fall of the Ming dynasty, that the Vietnamese state incorporated the Hà Tiên principality into Vietnamese administrative control. Prior to Mạc Tử Thiêm's death, Hà Tiên had been an autonomous principality. Through the incorporation of Hà Tiên, the Nguyễn dynasty thus further extended their borders amidst a period of tense regional competition involving the Siamese, Vietnamese, and Khmer.\n\nThis period of unprecedented southward territorial expansion was cited by the Gia Long emperor to the Qing court in its request for the Vietnamese state to be recognized by the term Nan Yue rather than Annan, a request that ultimately resulted in its current name of Yue Nan, or Vietnam. (See: Mekong Delta - History, Vietnamese Period)\n\nHistorian David Chandler argues that further long-term effects of Vietnamese southward territorial expansion into Kampucha Krom included: (1) Cambodia being \"cut off to a large extent from maritime access to the outside world\"; (2) the removal of \"large portions of territory and tens of thousands of ethnic Khmer from Cambodian jurisdiction\"; and (3) the placement of Cambodia in a vise between its two powerful neighbors of Siam and Vietnam.\n\n## Environment and infrastructure\n\nAs implied by its alternate name of Kampuchea Lik Tuk, or \"Flooded Cambodia\", Kampuchea Krom sees an abundance of water, with events like high flooding, high rainfall, and seawater incursions varying with the seasons. The abundance of water brought by these events, together with the natural flat plain that characterizes its region, makes Kampuchea Krom a productive agricultural area with rich, fertile soils. However, its swampy and amphibious nature, accompanied by seasonal dry spells, have resulted in researchers' characterization of the region as resistant to human settlement, with significant infrastructural development required to make permanent settlement possible.\n\n## Phno\n\nAnthropologist Philip Taylor's ethnographic text on Khmer communities within Kampuchea Krom identifies a number of strategies employed by the Khmer to utilize local precipitation for the purposes of agriculture and consumption, even during the dry season. These strategies differ across its geomorphically distinct sub-regions. One key strategy is that of harvesting fresh rain water stored within the phno, a strategy that is particularly prominent within the northern coastal complex.\n\nThe northern coastal complex is a \"flange of flat, salt-impregnated land lying between the mouths of the Mekong and Bassac Rivers and bounded by the ocean to the east\", an area often perceived as the \"quintessential Khmer region of Vietnam\" by researchers and tourists alike. The region sees annual wet and dry seasons. Its rainy season lasts from May to December and covers the majority of the region with water. During the dry season however, soil surfaces crack and drinking water becomes extremely scarce.\n\nTaylor identifies the phno, or \"elevated ridges of coarse sandy soil, between one to five metres high\", as crucial to the sustenance of life within the northern coastal complex, constituting both cosmological and strategic significance for the Khmers in the region. According to Taylor's interlocuter, a Pali teacher in the region, the phno were the first land to emerge, and comprised the ancient lands of Suvannaphum through which the Buddha traversed during his travels across the world.\n\nAccording to the Abbot of Wat Knong Srok, Buddhist Khmer thought further explains the stratification of the world and its elements, where humans live upon the land, water supports the land, and water rests on air, otherwise expressed in Khmer as: Kyol tro tuk [air supports water]\n\nTuk tro dei [water supports land]\n\nDei tro munnous [land supports people]Alongside this cosmological explanation of the elements, Taylor cites people at the Tra Vinh museum of Khmer culture and other locals to suggest that it is the height of the phno, and the numerousness of the phno in the region, that has made the northern coastal dune complex habitable, and one of the oldest inhabited places in Kampuchea Krom. Further, though groundwater in the region is salinated throughout the year, the absorption and retention of fresh rain water by the sand dunes during the rainy months creates natural freshwater reservoirs for residents. The less dense freshwater remains above the denser saline groundwater without mingling, both of which lie at a shallow depth beneath apparently dry land and accessible with some digging.\n\n## Irrigation\n\nNumerous irrigation projects have been undertaken in Kampuchea Krom, including by the French during the colonial period of the mid-twentieth century, and by the Vietnamese, following their significant expansion into the region in the nineteenth century and the post-war period of the late twentieth century. Environmental historian David Biggs argues that these irrigation projects have often reflected states' desires to incorporate the region into their nation-building projects. The construction of such irrigation infrastructure has also been the source of a number of Khmer-led rebellions within the region (see: Vĩnh Tế Canal).\n\n## Improvements to crop yield\n\nResearchers assessing changes in agricultural production within the region often assess that the infrastructural development of such irrigation projects have been a success, citing statistics like the doubling of rice production in the delta between 1980 and 1995, following the digging of canals and raising of dykes. Kono Yasuyuki argues that the moderation of the \"hydrological environment by infrastructure improvement is essential for agricultural intensification and diversification in the deltas\", and for the \"production of a substantial surplus of rice and its export\".\n\n## Critiques of irrigation efforts\n\nThe Chợ Gạo Canal was built by the Colonial Department of Public Works to connect Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) to the nearest delta port. Biggs draws from records from the Maritime and Colonial Review to argue that the Chợ Gạo Canal, despite opening to great success and fanfare in 1877, quickly became unnavigable within the short span of several months. The flatness of the delta, and the tides of the sea had resulted in the formation of bars of silt that choked off all but one of the canal's waterways.\n\nDrawing on a later example in the mid-1980s, Taylor examines the impact of irrigation and infrastructural development in the saltwater river region of Kampuchea Krom. The intensification of canal digging and dyke construction during the post-war period turned \"nearly the entire saltwater rivers region [into] a freshwater zone\", making fresh water conveniently available to Khmer residents in the region for the first time. New high yield rice varieties were made simultaneously available to the Khmer. However, due to the new rice varieties' dependence on pesticides, canals, rivers, and ponds in the area had been contaminated. By the mid-1990s, Taylor argues that the Khmer \"faced conditions of water scarcity even more dire than in the pre-canal period\", with no safe water sources.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nThe delta region of Kampuchea Krom supports a diverse biota, including two mammals of conservation significance, the Hairy-nosed Otter and the Dugong. A further at least 37 species of birds, and 470 species of fish of conservation significance have been recorded.\n\nHowever, the high use of fertilisers and pesticides to support the intensification of agriculture in the region, has resulted in nutrient and pesticide runoff, endangering aquatic biodiversity in the region. Khmer farmers affiliated to Wat Bei Chhau observe that local fish stocks have declined, attributing the decline to high-yield rice varieties' need for pesticides and comparing the new rice varieties with seasonal rice grown in the past that required no pesticides, and did not kill the fish.\n\nContinued human activities within the region, including overfishing, and the construction of dams and other irrigation efforts are expected to have further ill effects on the biodiversity of the region. These effects include the blocking of fish migration pathways, and the trapping of nutrient and sediment, resulting in erosion and the loss of arable land.\n\nClimate change and rising sea levels in the long term are expected to result in a significant loss of land in the region, as well as the loss of coastal habitats as brackish water becomes saline and freshwater areas become brackish or saline.\n\nTaylor suggests that these instances of environmental decline and changes in biodiversity have convinced many Khmers in the region of the imminence of an apocalypse (pleung ka). As shared by the Khmer Buddhist monk, the apocalypse will come in the form of fire, floods and winds that consume the earthly realm, with only the most virtuous followers of the Buddha's message escaping and achieving rebirth in the celestial realm as teovada. Taylor takes the Khmers' interpretation of environmental and ecological change in the region to reflect the hold of monastic institutions within Kampuchea Krom, and the appeal of Buddhist pathways to salvation.\n\n## Areas\n\nKampuchea Krom was originally divided into only four provinces Don Nai, Long Haor, Moat Chruk, and Peam. According to Cambodian sources, it now covers approximately the areas of twenty-one Vietnamese districts.\n\nAccording to Cambodian sources, the Khmer names of the local divisions have been continually renamed by Vietnamese authorities. Vietnamese names are seen as a calque of the original Khmer names such as Sa Đéc (Khmer: Phsar Dek), Sóc Trăng (Khmer: Srok Khleang), Trà Vinh (Khmer: Preah Trapeang), Bạc Liêu (Khmer: Pol Leav), Cà Mau (Khmer: Toek Khmau), Mỹ Tho (Khmer: Me Sar); Đồng Nai (Khmer: Don Nai). Some Vietnamese names were translated from the meaning of the original Khmer names such as Bến Tre (Khmer: Kampong Roessei), Bến Nghé (Khmer: Kampong Krabei).\n\n## See also\n\n* Khmer Krom\n\n* History of Cambodia\n\n* Funan\n\n* Chenla\n\n* Khmer Empire\n\n* Six Provinces of Southern Vietnam\n\n## References\n\nGeography of Cambodia\nFormer countries in Cambodian history\nRegions of Southeast Asia\nCambodia–Vietnam relations\nIrredentism\nCambodian nationalism\nMekong Delta"}

It is located at 1776 D Street NW, sharing a city block with the DAR's later-built Administration Building, and Constitution Hall. Completed in 1910, it is the oldest of the three buildings. It was the site of the 1922 Washington Naval Conference, a major diplomatic event in the aftermath of World War I. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972.\n\n## Description\n\nMemorial Continental Hall occupies the eastern third of the city block bounded by C and D, 17th and 18th Streets NW, on the west side of the Ellipse near the White House. It is a two-story masonry structure, built out of brick and concrete whose exterior is clad in Vermont marble with Georgian revival features. Its three street-facing elevations all have monumental two-story porticos with Doric columns. The principal entrance, facing east toward 17th Street and the Ellipse, is extended to function as a porte cochere, with a drive passing under it. The south portico is semi-circular, with thirteen columns.\n\n## History\n\nMemorial Continental Hall was commissioned by the DAR in 1902 to be used as a headquarters, assembly hall, and meeting place for DAR conferences. Architect Edward Pearce Casey designed the building, and construction occurred between 1904 and 1910. It was the first of three DAR buildings erected on the same site. The nearby Administration Building was built in 1920, and Constitution Hall was built at the opposite end of the site in 1929. The Administration Building was expanded in 1950 to unite all three buildings.\n\nThe final act of the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession, initiated by Alice Paul, was a meeting at the Memorial Continental Hall. Speakers were Anna Howard Shaw, Carrie Chapman Catt, Mary Johnston, and Helen Adams Keller. \n\nMemorial Continental Hall was the site of the Washington Naval Conference in 1921-22, a major diplomatic meeting in which the major powers of the world agreed to limit the sizes and capabilities of their naval forces.\nIn 1943 the hall was loaned to the American Red Cross for emergency wartime work.\nIn 1949, the stage in the auditorium was removed and the room was converted to a library.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C.\n\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in central Washington, D.C.\n\n## External links\n\n* \n\n* \n\nNational Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C.\nClubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington, D.C.\nHeadquarters in the United States\nHistoric American Buildings Survey in Washington, D.C.\n1910 establishments in Washington, D.C.\nLibraries on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington, D.C.\nColonial Revival architecture in Washington, D.C.\nDaughters of the American Revolution buildings\nDaughters of the American Revolution monuments and memorials"}

{"id": "49315307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn%20Nordin", "title": "Quinn Nordin", "text": "Quinn Nordin (born August 16, 1998) is an American professional football placekicker. He played college football at Michigan and signed with the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 2021.\n\n## Early life\n\nNordin played high school football at Rockford High School in Rockford, Michigan. Nordin missed much of his senior season due to a shoulder injury, but returned to action late for a Rockford team that made it to the third round of the Division-1 state playoffs with an 8–3 overall record. He converted two of three field goal attempts during his senior year with a long of 51 yards, landed seven punts inside the 20 yard line (while averaging 53 yards per punt), and landed 17 of 18 kickoffs in the endzone for touchbacks (the other was an onside kick). Following his senior season, Nordin was named USA Today High School All-American.\n\nNordin was listed as the nation's top kicker by Scout.com and the No. 9 overall kicker by ESPN. He was rated as a three-star prospect by both Rivals.com and ESPN.com. Nordin was verbally committed to Penn State in July 2015, but later withdrew his commitment. In January 2016, Nordin gained national attention when Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh conducted a sleepover recruiting session at Nordin's house. On National Signing Day, February 3, 2016, Nordin committed to play college football for the Michigan Wolverines.\n\n## College career\n\nOn September 2, 2017, Nordin completed four field goals in his first collegiate start against Florida, including from 55 and 50 yards. He became the first Michigan kicker to hit multiple field goals of 50 yards or more in the same game. Just one game into his career, Nordin tied for third all-time at Michigan with two made field goals of 50 yards or longer. His 55-yard field goal marked the longest field goal in a collegiate game played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, and the longest converted by a Michigan freshman. Following his outstanding performance, Nordin was named the Big Ten Co-Special Teams Player of the Week for the week ending September 4, 2017. On September 16 against Air Force, Nordin matched a Michigan record by going 5-for-5 on his field goal attempts. He also converted both of his point after attempts (PAT) giving him 17 points in the game, falling one short of the Michigan single-game scoring record for a kicker. For his performance, Nordin was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week for the second time on September 18, 2017. Nordin missed his first PAT of the season on October 21, 2017, against the Penn State Nittany Lions.\n\nDuring the 2018 season, Nordin appeared in the first 10 games of the season and completed 44 out of 45 PAT (0.978). However, he only connected on 11 out of 16 field goal attempts (0.688), and was 3 out of 7 (0.429) in his last four games.\n\nDuring the 2019 season, Nordin shared the field goal and point after duties with sophomore kicker Jake Moody. He appeared in 9 games during the regular season, connecting on 27 out of 28 PAT (0.964) and 7 out of 10 field goals (.700). On January 1, 2020, Nordin converted a 57-yard field goal at the end of the first half of the 2020 Citrus Bowl against Alabama, setting a record for the longest field goal in Citrus Bowl history, and tying the record for the longest field goal made in Michigan's program history.\n\nOn November 14, 2020, Nordin set a Michigan program record for the most field goals at 40 yards or longer (14) with a 46-yard field goal in third quarter during a game against Wisconsin.\n\n## Professional career\n\nAfter not being selected in the 2021 NFL draft, Nordin signed as an undrafted free agent (UDFA) with the New England Patriots on May 6, 2021. Unusually, Nordin was the only UDFA signed by the Patriots in 2021.\n\nOn August 31, 2021, the New England Patriots chose Nordin to be their kicker, cutting veteran kicker Nick Folk, despite a \"disastrous\" second preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles in which he missed a 36-yard field goal and two extra point attempts. After being inactive Week 1, he was placed on injured reserve on September 18, 2021 with an abdomen injury. He was released on December 1, 2021 and re-signed to the practice squad. He signed a reserve/future contract with the Patriots on January 17, 2022.\n\nOn June 10, 2022, Nordin was waived with a non-football injury designation. Three days later Nordin cleared waivers and reverted to the Patriots' reserve/NFI list. He was waived on February 15, 2023.\n\n## External links\n\n* \n\n* Michigan profile\n\n1998 births\nLiving people\nPeople from Rockford, Michigan\nPlayers of American football from Michigan\nAmerican football placekickers\nMichigan Wolverines football players\nNew England Patriots players"}
{"id": "40004631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin%E2%80%93Song%20wars", "title": "Jin–Song wars", "text": "The Jin–Song Wars were a series of conflicts between the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty (1115–1234) and the Han-led Song dynasty (960–1279). In 1115, Jurchen tribes rebelled against their overlords, the Khitan-led Liao dynasty (916–1125), and declared the formation of the Jin. Allying with the Song against their common enemy the Liao dynasty, the Jin promised to cede to the Song the Sixteen Prefectures that had fallen under Liao control since 938. The Song agreed but the Jin's quick defeat of the Liao combined with Song military failures made the Jin reluctant to cede territory. After a series of negotiations that embittered both sides, the Jurchens attacked the Song in 1125, dispatching one army to Taiyuan and the other to Bianjing (modern Kaifeng), the Song capital.\n\nSurprised by news of an invasion, Song general Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan, which was besieged and later captured. As the second Jin army approached the capital, Song emperor Huizong abdicated and fled south. Qinzong, his eldest son, was enthroned. The Jin dynasty laid siege to Kaifeng in 1126, but Qinzong negotiated their retreat from the capital by agreeing to a large annual indemnity. Qinzong reneged on the deal and ordered Song forces to defend the prefectures instead of fortifying the capital. The Jin resumed war and again besieged Kaifeng in 1127. They captured Qinzong, many members of the imperial family and high officials of the Song imperial court in an event known as the Jingkang Incident. This separated north and south China between Jin and Song. Remnants of the Song imperial family retreated to southern China and, after brief stays in several temporary capitals, eventually relocated to Lin'an (modern Hangzhou). The retreat divided the dynasty into two distinct periods, Northern Song and Southern Song.\n\nThe Jurchens tried to conquer southern China in the 1130s but were bogged down by a pro-Song insurgency in the north and a counteroffensive by Song generals, including Yue Fei and Han Shizhong. The Song generals regained some territories but retreated on the orders of Southern Song emperor Gaozong, who supported a peaceful resolution to the war. The Treaty of Shaoxing (1142) set the boundary of the two empires along the Huai River, but conflicts between the two dynasties continued until the fall of Jin in 1234. A war against the Song begun by the 4th Jin emperor, Wanyan Liang, was unsuccessful. He lost the Battle of Caishi (1161) and was later assassinated by his own disaffected officers. An invasion of Jin territory motivated by Song revanchism (1206–1208) was also unsuccessful. A decade later, Jin launched an abortive military campaign against the Song in 1217 to replace territory they had lost to the invading Mongols. The Song allied with the Mongols in 1233, and in the next year jointly captured Caizhou, the last refuge of the Jin emperor. The Jin dynasty collapsed that year. After the demise of Jin, the Song became a target of the Mongols, and collapsed in 1279.\n\nThe wars engendered an era of swift technological, cultural, and demographic changes in China. Battles between the Song and Jin brought about the introduction of various gunpowder weapons. The siege of De'an in 1132 was the first recorded use of the fire lance, an early ancestor of firearms. There were also reports of incendiary huopao or the exploding tiehuopao, incendiary arrows, and other related weapons. In northern China, Jurchens were the ruling minority of an empire predominantly inhabited by former subjects of the Song. Jurchen migrants settled in the conquered territories and assimilated with the local culture. Jin, a conquest dynasty, instituted a centralized imperial bureaucracy modeled on previous Chinese dynasties, basing their legitimacy on Confucian philosophy. Song refugees from the north resettled in southern China. The north was the cultural center of China, and its conquest by Jin diminished the regional stature of the Song dynasty. The Southern Song, however, quickly returned to economic prosperity, and trade with Jin was lucrative despite decades of warfare. Lin'an, the Southern Song capital, expanded into a major city for commerce.\n\n## Fragile Song–Jin alliance\n\nThe Jurchens were a Tungusic-speaking group of semi-agrarian tribes inhabiting areas of northeast Asia that are now part of Northeast China. Many of the Jurchen tribes were vassals of the Liao dynasty (907–1125), an empire ruled by the nomadic Khitans that included most of modern Mongolia, a portion of North China, Northeast China, northern Korea, and parts of the Russian Far East. To the south of the Liao lay the Han Chinese Song Empire (960–1276). The Song and Liao were at peace, but since a military defeat to the Liao in 1005, the Song paid its northern neighbor an annual indemnity of 200,000 bolts of silk and 100,000 ounces of silver. Before the Jurchens overthrew the Khitan, married Jurchen women and Jurchen girls were raped by Liao Khitan envoys as a custom which caused resentment by the Jurchens against the Khitan. Song princesses committed suicide to avoid rape or were killed for resisting rape by the Jin.\n\nIn 1114, the chieftain Wanyan Aguda (1068–1123) united the disparate Jurchen tribes and led a revolt against the Liao. In 1115 he named himself emperor of the Jin \"golden\" dynasty (1115–1234). Informed by a Liao defector of the success of the Jurchen uprising, the Song emperor Huizong (r. 1100–1127) and his highest military commander the eunuch Tong Guan saw the Liao weakness as an opportunity to recover the Sixteen Prefectures, a line of fortified cities and passes that the Liao had annexed from the Shatuo Turk Later Jin in 938, and that the Song had repeatedly but unsuccessfully tried to reconquer. The Song thus sought an alliance with the Jin against their common enemy the Liao.\n\nBecause the land routes between the Song and Jin were controlled by the Liao, diplomatic exchanges had to occur by traveling across the Bohai Sea. Negotiations for an alliance began secretly under the pretense that the Song wanted to acquire horses from the Khitans. Song diplomats traveled to the Jin court to meet Aguda in 1118, while Jurchen envoys arrived in the Song capital Kaifeng the next year. At the beginning, the two sides agreed to keep whatever Liao territory they would seize in combat. In 1120, Aguda agreed to cede the Sixteen Prefectures to the Song in exchange for transfer to the Jin of the annual tributary payments that the Song had been giving the Liao. By the end of 1120, however, the Jurchens had seized the Liao Supreme Capital, and offered the Song only parts of the Sixteen Prefectures. Among other things, Jin would keep the Liao Western Capital of Datong at the western end of the Sixteen Prefectures. The two sides agreed that the Jin would now attack the Liao Central Capital, whereas the Song would seize the Liao Southern Capital, Yanjing (modern-day Beijing).\n\nThe joint attack against the Liao had been planned for 1121, but it was rescheduled for 1122. On February 23 of that year, Jin captured the Liao Central Capital as promised. The Song delayed their entry into the war because it diverted resources to fighting the Western Xia in the northwest and suppressing a large popular rebellion led by Fang La in the south. When a Song army under Tong Guan's command finally attacked Yanjing in May 1122, the smaller forces of the weakened Liao repelled the invaders with ease. Another attack failed in the fall. Both times, Tong was forced to retreat back to Kaifeng. After the first attack, Aguda changed the terms of the agreement and only promised Yanjing and six other prefectures to the Song. In early 1123 it was Jurchen forces that easily took the Liao Southern Capital. They sacked it and enslaved its population.\n\nThe quick collapse of the Liao led to more negotiations between the Song and Jin. Jurchen military success and their effective control over the Sixteen Prefectures gave them more leverage. Aguda grew increasingly frustrated as he realized that despite their military failures the Song still intended to seize most of the prefectures. In the spring of 1123 the two sides finally set the terms of the first Song–Jin treaty. Only seven prefectures (including Yanjing) would be returned to the Song, and the Song would pay an annual indemnity of 300,000 packs of silk and 200,000 taels of silver to the Jin, as well as a one-time payment of one million strings of copper coins to compensate the Jurchens for the tax revenue they would have earned had they not returned the prefectures. In May 1123 Tong Guan and the Song armies entered the looted Yanjing.\n\n## Collapse of the Song–Jin alliance\n\nBarely one month after the Song had recovered Yanjing, Zhang Jue (), who had served as military governor of the Liao prefecture of Pingzhou about east of Yanjing, killed the main Jin official in that city and turned it over to the Song. The Jurchens defeated his armies a few months later and Zhang took refuge in Yanjing. Even though the Song agreed to execute him in late 1123, this incident put tension between the two states, because the 1123 treaty had explicitly forbidden both sides from harboring defectors. In 1124, Song officials further angered Jin by asking for the cession of nine more border prefectures. The new Jin emperor Taizong (r. 1123–1135), Aguda's brother and successor, hesitated, but warrior princes Wanyan Zonghan and Wanyan Zongwang () vehemently refused to give them any more territory. Taizong eventually granted two prefectures, but by then the Jin leaders were ready to attack their southern neighbor.\n\nBefore they could invade the Song, the Jurchens reached a peace agreement with their western neighbors the Tangut Western Xia in 1124. The following year near the Ordos Desert, they captured Tianzuo, the last emperor of the Liao, putting an end to the Liao dynasty for good. Ready to end their alliance with the Song, the Jurchens began preparations for an invasion.\n\n## First campaign\n\nIn November 1125 Taizong ordered his armies to attack the Song. The defection of Zhang Jue two years earlier served as the casus belli. Two armies were sent to capture the major cities of the Song.\n\n## Siege of Taiyuan\n\nThe western army, led by Wanyan Zonghan, departed from Datong and headed towards Taiyuan through the mountains of Shanxi, on its way to the Song western capital Luoyang. The Song forces were not expecting an invasion and were caught off guard. The Chinese general Tong Guan was informed of the military expedition by an envoy he had sent to the Jin to obtain the cession of two prefectures. The returning envoy reported that the Jurchens were willing to forgo an invasion if the Song ceded control of Hebei and Shanxi to the Jin. Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan and left command of his troops to Wang Bing. Jin armies besieged the city in mid January 1126. Under Wang Bing's command, Taiyuan held on long enough to stop the Jurchen troops from advancing to Luoyang.\n\n## First siege of Kaifeng\n\nMeanwhile, the eastern army, commanded by Wanyan Zongwang, was dispatched towards Yanjing (modern Beijing) and eventually the Song capital Kaifeng. It did not face much armed opposition. Zongwang easily took Yanjing, where Song general and former Liao governor Guo Yaoshi () switched his allegiances to the Jin. When the Song had tried to reclaim the Sixteen Prefectures, they had faced fierce resistance from the Han Chinese population, yet when the Jurchens invaded that area, the Han Chinese did not oppose them at all. By the end of December 1125, the Jin army had seized control of two prefectures and re-established Jurchen rule over the Sixteen Prefectures. The eastern army was nearing Kaifeng by early 1126.\n\nFearing the approaching Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital would have been viewed as an act of capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more important than preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance. In January 1126, a few days before the New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.\n\nKaifeng was besieged on January 31, 1126. The commander of the Jurchen army promised to spare the city if the Song submitted to Jin as a vassal; forfeited the prime minister and an imperial prince as prisoners; ceded the Chinese prefectures of Hejian, Taiyuan, and Zhongshan; and offered an indemnity of 50 million taels of silver, 5 million taels of gold, 1 million packs of silk, 1 million packs of satin, 10,000 horses, 10,000 mules, 10,000 cattle, and 1,000 camels. This indemnity was worth about 180 years of the annual tribute the Song had been paying to the Jin since 1123.\n\nWith little prospect of help from afar arriving, infighting broke out in the Song court between the officials who supported the Jin offer and those who opposed it. Opponents of the treaty like Li Gang (; 1083–1140) rallied around the proposal of remaining in defensive positions until reinforcements arrived and Jurchen supplies ran out. They botched an ambush against the Jin that was carried out at night, and were replaced by officials who supported peace negotiations. The failed attack pushed Qinzong into meeting the Jurchen demands, and his officials convinced him to go through with the deal. The Song recognized Jin control over the three prefectures. The Jurchen army ended the siege in March after 33 days.\n\n## Second campaign\n\nAlmost as soon as the Jin armies had left Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong reneged on the deal and dispatched two armies to repel the Jurchen troops attacking Taiyuan and bolster the defenses of Zhongshan and Hejian. An army of 90,000 soldiers and another of 60,000 were defeated by Jin forces by June. A second expedition to rescue Taiyuan was also unsuccessful.\n\nAccusing the Song of violating the agreement and realizing the weakness of the Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement and left a small force in charge of the siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid-December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.\n\n## Second siege of Kaifeng\n\nAfter the defeat of several Song armies in the north, Emperor Qinzong wanted to negotiate a truce with the Jin, but he committed a massive strategic blunder when he commanded his remaining armies to protect prefectural cities instead of Kaifeng. Neglecting the importance of the capital, he left Kaifeng defended with fewer than 100,000 soldiers. The Song forces were dispersed throughout China, powerless to stop the second Jurchen siege of the city.\n\nThe Jin assault commenced in mid-December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong continued to sue for peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later.\n\nQigong, the former emperor Huizong, and members of the Song court were captured by the Jurchens as hostages. They were taken north to Huining (modern Harbin), where they were stripped of their royal privileges and reduced to commoners. The former emperors were humiliated by their captors. They were mocked with disparaging titles like \"Muddled Virtue\" and \"Double Muddled\". In 1128 Jin made them perform a ritual meant for war criminals. The harsh treatment of the Song royalty softened after the death of Huizong in 1135. Titles were granted to the deceased monarch, and his son Qinzong was promoted to Duke, a position with a salary.\n\n## Reasons for Song failure\n\nMany factors contributed to the Song's repeated military blunders and subsequent loss of northern China to the Jurchens. Traditional accounts of Song history held the venality of Huizong's imperial court responsible for the decline of the dynasty. These narratives condemned Huizong and his officials for their moral failures. Early Song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of Confucianism, but the enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after the reformist Wang Anshi's expulsion as chancellor in 1076. Corruption marred the reign of Huizong, who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler. Huizong was known for his extravagance, and funded the costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state's grip on power.\n\nA modern analysis by Ari Daniel Levine places more of the blame on deficiencies in the military and bureaucratic leadership. The loss of northern China was not inevitable. The military was overextended by a government too assured of its own military prowess. Huizong diverted the state's resources to failed wars against the Western Xia. The Song insistence on a greater share of Liao territory only succeeded in provoking their Jin allies. Song diplomatic oversights underestimated Jin and allowed the unimpeded rise of Jurchen military power. The state had plentiful resources, with the exception of horses, but managed its assets poorly during battles. Unlike the expansive Han and Tang empires that preceded the Song, the Song did not have a significant foothold in Central Asia where a large proportion of its horses could be bred or procured. As Song general Li Gang noted, without a consistent supply of horses the dynasty was at a significant disadvantage against Jurchen cavalry: \"Jin were victorious only because they used iron-shielded cavalry, while we opposed them with foot soldiers. It is only to be expected that [our soldiers] were scattered and dispersed.\"\n\n## The enthronement of Emperor Gaozong\n\nThe Jin leadership had not expected or desired the fall of the Song dynasty. Their intention was to weaken the Song in order to demand more tribute, and they were unprepared for the magnitude of their victory. The Jurchens were preoccupied with strengthening their rule over the areas once controlled by Liao. Instead of continuing their invasion of the Song, an empire with a military that outnumbered their own, they adopted the strategy of \"using Chinese to control the Chinese\". The Jin hoped a proxy state would be capable of administering northern China and collecting the annual indemnity without requiring Jurchen interventions to quell anti-Jin uprisings. In 1127, the Jurchens installed a former Song official, Zhang Bangchang (張邦昌; 1081–1127), as puppet emperor of the newly established \"Da Chu\" (Great Chu) dynasty. The puppet government did not deter the resistance in northern China, but the insurgents were motivated by their anger towards the Jurchens' looting rather than by a sense of loyalty towards the inept Song court. A number of Song commanders, stationed in towns scattered across northern China, retained their allegiance to the Song, and armed volunteers organized militias opposed to the Jurchen military presence. The insurgency hampered the ability of the Jin to exert control over the north.\n\nMeanwhile, one Song prince, Zhao Gou, had escaped capture. He had been held up in Cizhou while on a diplomatic mission, and never made it back to Kaifeng. He was not present in the capital when the city fell to the Jurchens. The future Emperor Gaozong managed to evade the Jurchen troops tailing him by moving from one province to the next, traveling across Hebei, Henan, and Shandong. The Jurchens tried to lure him back to Kaifeng where they could finally capture him, but did not succeed. Zhao Gou finally arrived in the Song Southern Capital at Yingtianfu (; modern Shangqiu) in early June 1127. For Gaozong (r. 1127–1162), Yingtianfu was the first in a series of temporary capitals called xingzai . The court moved to Yingtianfu because of its historical importance to Emperor Taizu of Song, the founder of the dynasty, who had previously served in that city as a military governor. The symbolism of the city was meant to secure the political legitimacy of the new emperor, who was enthroned there on June 12.\n\nAfter reigning for barely one month, Zhang Bangchang was persuaded by the Song to step down as emperor of the Great Chu and to recognize the legitimacy of the Song imperial line. Li Gang pressured Gaozong to execute Zhang for betraying the Song. The emperor relented and Zhang was coerced into suicide. The killing of Zhang showed that the Song was willing to provoke the Jin, and that the Jin had yet to solidify their control over the newly conquered territories. The submission and abolition of Chu meant that Kaifeng was now back under Song control. (; 1059–1128), the Song general responsible for fortifying Kaifeng, entreated Gaozong to move the court back to the city, but Gaozong refused and retreated south. The southward move marked the end of the Northern Song and the beginning of the Southern Song era of Chinese history.\n\nThe descendant of Confucius at Qufu, the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou, while the newly established Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng. Zhang Xuan 張選, a great-grandson of Zhang Zai, also fled south with Gaozong.\n\n## The move south\n\nThe Song disbandment of the Great Chu and execution of Zhang Bangchang antagonized the Jurchens and violated the treaty that the two parties had negotiated. The Jin renewed their attacks on the Song and quickly reconquered much of northern China. In late 1127 Gaozong moved his court further south from Yingtianfu to Yangzhou, south of the Huai River and north of the Yangtze River, by sailing down the Grand Canal. The court spent over a year in the city. When the Jurchens advanced to the Huai River, the court was partially evacuated to Hangzhou in 1129. Days later, Gaozong narrowly escaped on horseback, just a few hours ahead of Jurchen vanguard troops. After a coup in Hangzhou almost dethroned him, in May 1129 he moved his capital back north to Jiankang (modern Nanjing) on the south bank of the Yangtze. One month later, however, Zong Ze's successor Du Chong () vacated his forces from Kaifeng, exposing Jiankang to attack. The emperor moved back to Hangzhou in September, leaving Jiankang in Du Chong's hands. The Jin eventually captured Kaifeng in early 1130.\n\nFrom 1127 to 1129, the Song sent thirteen embassies to the Jin to discuss peace terms and to negotiate the release of Gaozong's mother and Huizong, but the Jin court ignored them. In December 1129, the Jin started a new military offensive, dispatching two armies across the Huai River in the east and west. On the western front, an army invaded Jiangxi, the area where the Song dowager empress resided, and captured Hongzhou (, present-day Nanchang). They were ordered to retreat a few months later when the eastern army withdrew.\n\nMeanwhile, on the eastern front, Wuzhu commanded the main Jin army. He crossed the Yangtze southwest of Jiankang and took that city when Du Chong surrendered. Wuzhu set out from Jiankang and advanced rapidly to try to capture Gaozong. The Jin seized Hangzhou (January 22, 1130) and then Shaoxing further south (February 4), but general Zhang Jun's (1086–1154) battle with Wuzhu near Ningbo gave Gaozong time to escape. By the time Wuzhu resumed pursuit, the Song court was fleeing on ships to islands off the coast of Zhejiang, and then further south to Wenzhou. The Jin sent ships to chase after Gaozong, but failed to catch him. They gave up the pursuit and the Jurchens retreated north. After they plundered the undefended cities of Hangzhou and Suzhou, they finally started to face resistance from Song armies led by Yue Fei and Han Shizhong. The latter even inflicted a major defeat on Jurchen forces and tried to prevent Wuzhu from crossing back to the north bank of the Yangtze. The small boats of the Jin army were outmatched by Han Shizhong's fleet of seagoing vessels. Wuzhu eventually managed to cross the river when he had his troops use incendiary arrows to neutralize Han's ships by burning their sails. Wuzhu's troops came back south of the Yangtze one last time to Jiankang, which they pillaged, and then headed north. Yet the Jin had been caught off guard by the strength of the Song navy, and Wuzhu never tried to cross the Yangtze River again. In early 1131, Jin armies between the Huai and the Yangtze were repelled by bandits loyal to the Song. Zhang Rong (), the leader of the bandits, was given a government position for his victory against the Jin.\n\nAfter the Jin incursion that almost captured Gaozong, the sovereign ordered pacification commissioner Zhang Jun (1097–1164), who was in charge of Shaanxi and Sichuan in the far west, to attack the Jin there to relieve pressure on the court. Zhang put together a large army, but was defeated by Wuzhu near Xi'an in late 1130. Wuzhu advanced further west into Gansu, and drove as far south as Jiezhou (, modern Wudu). The most important battles between Jin and Song in 1131 and 1132 took place in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan. The Jin lost two battles at Heshang Yuan in 1131. After failing to enter Sichuan, Wuzhu retreated to Yanjing. He returned to the western front again from 1132 to 1134. The Jin attacked Hubei and Shaanxi in 1132. Wuzhu captured Heshang Yuan in 1133, but his advance was halted by a defeat at Xianren Pass. He gave up on taking Sichuan, and no more major battles were fought between the Jin and Song for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe Song court returned to Hangzhou in 1133, and the city was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Lin'an later that same year, a sign that the court had in practice established Lin'an as the Song capital without a formal declaration. It was treated as a temporary capital. Between 1130 and 1137, the court would sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Lin'an. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital, but Lin'an won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Lin'an, including lakes and rice paddies, made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Lin'an the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would still be in place. Lin'an would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center.\n\n## Da Qi invades the Song\n\nQin Hui, an official of the Song court, recommended a peaceful solution to the conflict in 1130, saying that, \"If it is desirable that there will be no more conflicts under Heaven, it is necessary for the southerners to stay in the south and the northerners in the north.\" Gaozong, who considered himself a northerner, initially rejected the proposal. There were gestures toward peace in 1132, when the Jin freed an imprisoned Song diplomat, and in 1133, when the Song offered to become a Jin vassal, but a treaty never materialized. The Jin requirement that the border between the two states be moved south from the Huai River to the Yangtze was too large of a hurdle for the two sides to reach an agreement.\n\nThe continuing insurgency of anti-Jin forces in northern China hampered the Jurchen campaigns south of the Yangtze. Reluctant to let the war drag on, the Jin decided to create Da Qi (the \"Great Qi\"), their second attempt at a puppet state in northern China. The Jurchens believed that this state, nominally ruled by someone of Han Chinese descent, would be able to attract the allegiance of disaffected members of the insurgency. The Jurchens also suffered from a shortage of skilled manpower, and controlling the entirety of northern China was not administratively feasible. In the final months of 1129, Liu Yu (; 1073–1143) won the favor of the Jin emperor Taizong. Liu was a Song official from Hebei who had been a prefect of Jinan in Shandong before his defection to the Jin in 1128. Da Qi was formed late in 1130, and the Jin enthroned Liu as its emperor. Daming in Hebei was the first capital of Qi, before its move to Kaifeng, former capital of the Northern Song. The Qi government instituted military conscription, made an attempt at reforming the bureaucracy, and enacted laws that enforced the collection of high taxes. It was also responsible for supplying a large portion of the troops that fought the Song in the seven years following its creation.\n\nThe Jin granted Qi more autonomy than the first puppet government of Chu, but Liu Yu was obligated to obey the orders of the Jurchen generals. With Jin support, Da Qi invaded the Song in November 1133. Li Cheng, a Song turncoat who had joined the Qi, led the campaign. Xiangyang and nearby prefectures fell to his army. The capture of Xiangyang on the Han River gave the Jurchens a passage into the central valley of the Yangtze River. Their southward push was halted by the general Yue Fei. In 1134, Yue Fei defeated Li and retook Xiangyang and its surrounding prefectures. Later that year, however, Qi and Jin initiated a new offensive further east along the Huai River. For the first time, Gaozong issued an edict officially condemning Da Qi. The armies of Qi and Jin won a series of victories in the Huai valley, but were repelled by Han Shizhong near Yangzhou and by Yue Fei at Luzhou (, modern Hefei). Their sudden withdrawal in 1135 in response to the death of Jin Emperor Taizong gave the Song time to regroup. The war recommenced in late 1136 when Da Qi attacked the Huainan circuits of the Song. Qi lost a battle at Outang (), in modern Anhui, against a Song army led by Yang Qizhong (; 1102–1166). The victory boosted Song morale, and the military commissioner Zhang Jun (1097–1164) convinced Gaozong to begin plans for a counterattack. Gaozong first agreed, but he abandoned the counteroffensive when an officer named Li Qiong () killed his superior official and defected to the Jin with 30,000 soldiers. This rebellion was provoked by Zhang Jun's attempt to reassert government control over the regional military commanders, as the court had previously been forced to tolerate growing military autonomy during the chaos of the Jin invasion. Meanwhile, Emperor Xizong (r. 1135–1150) inherited the Jin throne from Taizong, and pushed for peace. He and his generals were disappointed with Liu Yu's military failures and believed that Liu was secretly conspiring with Yue Fei. In late 1137, the Jin reduced Liu Yu's title to that of a prince and abolished the state of Qi. The Jin and Song renewed the negotiations towards peace.\n\n## Song counteroffensive and the peace process\n\nGaozong promoted Qin Hui in 1138 and put him in charge of deliberations with the Jin. Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures. Aided by his control of the Censorate, Qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations. In 1138 the Jin and Song agreed to a treaty that designated the Yellow River as border between the two states and recognized Gaozong as a \"subject\" of the Jin. But because there remained opposition to the treaty in both the courts of the Jin and Song, the treaty never came into effect. A Jurchen army led by Wuzhu invaded in early 1140. The Song counteroffensive that followed achieved large territorial gains. Song general Liu Qi () won a battle against Wuzhu at Shunchang (modern Fuyang in Anhui). Yue Fei was assigned to head the Song forces defending the Huainan region. Instead of advancing to Huainan, however, Wuzhu retreated to Kaifeng and Yue's army followed him into Jin territory, disobeying an order by Gaozong that forbade Yue from going on the offensive. Yue captured Zhengzhou and sent soldiers across the Yellow River to stir up a peasant rebellion against the Jin. On July 8, 1140, at the Battle of Yancheng, Wuzhu launched a surprise attack on Song forces with an army of 100,000 infantry and 15,000 horsemen. Yue Fei directed his cavalry to attack the Jurchen soldiers and won a decisive victory. He continued on to Henan, where he recaptured Zhengzhou and Luoyang. Later in 1140, Yue was forced to withdraw after the emperor ordered him to return to the Song court.\n\nEmperor Gaozong supported settling a peace treaty with the Jurchens and sought to rein in the assertiveness of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, a critic of the treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks may have played a role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven.\n\nAfter his execution, Yue Fei's reputation for defending the Southern Song grew to that of a national folk hero. Qin Hui was denigrated by later historians, who accused him of betraying the Song. The real Yue Fei differed from the later myths based on his exploits. Contrary to traditional legends, Yue was only one of many generals who fought against the Jin in northern China. Traditional accounts have also blamed Gaozong for Yue Fei's execution and submitting to the Jin. Qin Hui, in a reply to Gaozong's gratitude for the success of the peace negotiations, told the emperor that \"the decision to make peace was entirely Your Majesty's. Your servant only carried it out; what achievement was there in this for me?\"\n\n## Treaty of Shaoxing\n\nOn October 11, 1142, after about a year of negotiations, the Treaty of Shaoxing was ratified, ending the conflict between the Jin and the Song. By the terms of the treaty, the Huai River, north of the Yangtze, was designated as the boundary between the two states. The Song agreed to pay a yearly tribute of 250,000 taels of silver and 250,000 packs of silk to the Jin.\n\nThe treaty reduced the Southern Song dynasty status to that of a Jin vassal. The document designated the Song as the \"insignificant state\", while the Jin was recognized as the \"superior state\". The text of the treaty has not survived in Chinese records, a clear sign of its humiliating reputation. The contents of the agreement were recovered from a Jurchen biography. Once the treaty had been settled, the Jurchens retreated north and trade resumed between the two empires. The peace ensured by the Treaty of Shaoxing lasted for the next 70 years, but was interrupted twice. One military campaign was initiated by the Song and the other by the Jin.\n\n## Wanyan Liang's war\n\n \nWanyan Liang led a coup against Emperor Xizong and became fourth emperor of the Jin dynasty in 1150. Wanyan Liang presented himself as a Chinese emperor, and planned to unite China by conquering the Song. In 1158, Wanyan Liang provided a casus belli by announcing that the Song had broken the 1142 peace treaty by acquiring horses. He instituted an unpopular draft that was the source of widespread unrest in the empire. Anti-Jin revolts erupted among the Khitans and in Jin provinces bordering the Song. Wanyan Liang did not allow dissent, and opposition to the war was severely punished. The Song had been notified beforehand of Wanyan Liang's plan. They prepared by securing their defenses along the border, mainly near the Yangtze River, but were hampered by Emperor Gaozong's indecisiveness. Gaozong's desire for peace made him averse to provoking the Jin. Wanyan Liang began the invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war. Jurchen armies personally led by Wanyan Liang left Kaifeng on October 15, reached the Huai River border on October 28, and marched in the direction of the Yangtze. The Song lost the Huai to the Jurchens but captured a few Jin prefectures in the west, slowing the Jurchen advance. A group of Jurchen generals were sent to cross the Yangtze near the city of Caishi (south of Ma'anshan in modern Anhui) while Wanyan Liang established a base near Yangzhou.\n\nThe Song official Yu Yunwen was in command of the army defending the river. The Jurchen army was defeated while attacking Caishi between November 26 and 27 during the Battle of Caishi. The paddle-wheel ships of the Song navy, armed with trebuchets that fired gunpowder bombs, overwhelmed the light ships of the Jin fleet. Jin ships were unable to compete because they were smaller and hastily constructed. The bombs launched by the Song contained mixtures of gunpowder, lime, scraps of iron, and a poison that was likely arsenic. Traditional Chinese accounts consider this the turning point of the war, characterizing it as a military upset that secured southern China from the northern invaders. The significance of the battle is said to have rivaled a similarly revered victory at the Battle of Fei River in the 4th century. Contemporaneous Song accounts claimed that the 18,000 Song soldiers commanded by Yu Yunwen and tasked with defending Caishi were able to defeat the invading Jurchen army of 400,000 soldiers. Modern historians are more skeptical and consider the Jurchen numbers an exaggeration. Song historians may have confused the number of Jurchen soldiers at the Battle of Caishi with the total number of soldiers under the command of Wanyan Liang. The conflict was not the one-sided battle that traditional accounts imply, and the Song had numerous advantages over the Jin. The Song fleet was larger than the Jin's, and the Jin were unable to use their greatest asset, cavalry, in a naval battle.\n\nA modern analysis of the battlefield has shown that it was a minor battle, although the victory did boost Song morale. The Jin lost, but only suffered about 4,000 casualties and the battle was not fatal to the Jurchen war effort. It was Wanyan Liang's poor relationships with the Jurchen generals, who despised him, that doomed the chances of a Jin victory. On December 15, Wanyan Liang was assassinated in his military camp by disaffected officers. He was succeeded by Emperor Shizong (r. 1161–1189), who had long resented Digunai for driving his wife, Lady Wulinda, to suicide. Shizong was pressured into ending the unpopular war with the Song, and ordered the withdrawal of Jin forces in 1162. Emperor Gaozong retired from the throne that same year. His mishandling of the war with Wanyan Liang was one of many reasons for his abdication. Skirmishes between the Song and Jin continued along the border, but subsided in 1165 after the negotiation of a peace treaty. There were no major territorial changes. The treaty dictated that the Song still had to pay the annual indemnity, but the indemnity was renamed from \"tribute\", which had implied a subordinate relationship, to \"payment\".\n\n## Song revanchism\n\nThe Jin were weakened by the pressure of the rising Mongols to the north, a series of floods culminating in a Yellow River flood in 1194 that devastated Hebei and Shandong in northern China, and the droughts and swarming locusts that plagued the south near the Huai. The Song were informed of the Jurchen predicament by their ambassadors, who traveled twice a year to the Jin capital, and started provoking their northern neighbor. The hostilities were instigated by chancellor Han Tuozhou. The Song Emperor Ningzong (r. 1194–1224) took little interest in the war effort. Under Han Tuozhou's supervision, preparations for the war proceeded gradually and cautiously. The court venerated the irredentist hero Yue Fei and Han orchestrated the publishing of historical records that justified war with the Jin. From 1204 onwards, Chinese armed groups raided Jurchen settlements. Han Tuozhou was designated the head of national security in 1205. The Song funded insurgents in the north that professed loyalist sympathies. These early clashes continued to escalate, partly abetted by revanchist Song officials, and war against the Jin was officially declared on June 14, 1206. The document that announced the war claimed the Jin lost the Mandate of Heaven, a sign that they were unfit to rule, and called for an insurrection of Han Chinese against the Jin state.\n\nSong armies led by general Bi Zaiyu (; d. 1217) captured the barely defended border city of Sizhou (on the north bank of the Huai River across from modern Xuyi County) but suffered large losses against the Jurchens in Hebei. The Jin repelled the Song and moved south to besiege the Song town of Chuzhou on the Grand Canal just south of the Huai River. Bi defended the town, and the Jurchens withdrew from the siege after three months. By the fall of 1206, however, the Jurchens had captured multiple towns and military bases. The Jin initiated an offensive against Song prefectures in the central front of the war, capturing Zaoyang and Guanghua (; on the Han River near modern Laohekou). By the fall of 1206, the Song offensive had already failed disastrously. Soldier morale sank as weather conditions worsened, supplies ran out, and hunger spread, forcing many to desert. The massive defections of Han Chinese in northern China that the Song had expected never materialized.\n\nA notable betrayal did occur on the Song side, however: Wu Xi (; d. 1207), the governor-general of Sichuan, defected to the Jin in December 1206. The Song had depended on Wu's success in the west to divert Jin soldiers away from the eastern front. He had attacked Jin positions earlier in 1206, but his army of about 50,000 men had been repelled. Wu's defection could have meant the loss of the entire western front of the war, but Song loyalists assassinated Wu on March 29, 1207, before Jin troops could take control of the surrendered territories. An Bing (; d. 1221) was given Wu Xi's position, but the cohesion of Song forces in the west fell apart after Wu's demise and commanders turned on each other in the ensuing infighting.\n\nFighting continued in 1207, but by the end of that year the war was at a stalemate. The Song was now on the defensive, while the Jin failed to make gains in Song territory it therefore cost both parties much more than it gained them. The failure of Han Tuozhou's aggressive policies against the Jurchens by this time round had depopularised him amongst the common people which situation was exploited by the Empress Yang and Shi Miyuan, his most powerful political rivals to garner support amongst other courtiers which led to his demise. On November 24, 1207, Han Touzhou on his way to Court he was intercepted, dragged outside Imperial precincts and bludgeoned to death by the Imperial Palace Guards. His accomplice Su Shidan () was executed, and other officials connected to Han were dismissed or exiled. Since neither combatant was eager to continue the war, they returned to negotiations. A peace treaty was signed on November 2, 1208, and the Song tribute to the Jin was reinstated. The Song annual indemnity increased by 50,000 taels of silver and 50,000 packs of fabric. The treaty also stipulated that the Song had to present to the Jin the head of Han Tuozhou, who the Jin held responsible for starting the war. The heads of Han and Su were severed from their exhumed corpses, exhibited to the public, then delivered to the Jin.\n\n## Jin–Song war during the rise of the Mongols\n\nThe Mongols, a nomadic confederation, had unified in the middle of the twelfth century. They and other steppe nomads occasionally raided the Jin empire from the northwest. The Jin shied away from punitive expeditions and was content with appeasement, similar to the practices of the Song. The Mongols, formerly a Jin tributary, ended their Jurchen vassalage in 1210 and attacked the Jin in 1211. In light of this event, the Song court debated ending tributary payments to the weakened Jin, but they again chose to avoid antagonizing the Jin. They refused Western Xia's offers of allying against the Jin in 1214 and willingly complied when in 1215 the Jin rejected a request to lower the annual indemnity. Meanwhile, in 1214, the Jin retreated from the besieged capital of Zhongdu to Kaifeng, which became the new capital of the dynasty. As the Mongols expanded, the Jin suffered territorial losses and attacked the Song in 1217 to compensate for their shrinking territory. Periodic Song raids against the Jin were the official justification for the war. Another likely motive was that the conquest of the Song would have given the Jin a place to escape should the Mongols succeed in taking control of the north. Shi Miyuan (; 1164–1233), the chancellor of Song Emperor Lizong (r. 1224–1264), was hesitant to fight the Jin and delayed the declaration of war for two months. Song generals were largely autonomous, allowing Shi to evade blame for their military blunders. The Jin advanced across the border from the center and western fronts. Jurchen military successes were limited, and the Jin faced repeated raids from the neighboring state of Western Xia. In 1217, the Song generals Meng Zongzheng () and Hu Zaixing () defeated the Jin and prevented them from capturing Zaoyang and Suizhou.\n\nA second Jin campaign in late 1217 did marginally better than the first. In the east, the Jin made little headway in the Huai River valley, but in the west they captured Xihezhou and Dasan Pass (; modern Shaanxi) in late 1217. The Jin tried to captured Suizhou in Jingxi South circuit again in 1218 and 1219, but failed. A Song counteroffensive in early 1218 captured Sizhou and in 1219 the Jin cities of Dengzhou and Tangzhou were pillaged twice by a Song army commanded by Zhao Fang (; d. 1221). In the west, command of the Song forces in Sichuan was given to An Bing, who had previously been dismissed from this position. He successfully defended the western front, but was unable to advance further because of local uprisings in the area. The Jin tried to extort an indemnity from the Song but never received it. In the last of the three campaigns, in early 1221, the Jin captured the city of Qizhou (; in Huainan West) deep in Song territory. Song armies led by Hu Zaixing and Li Quan (; d. 1231) defeated the Jin, who then withdrew. In 1224 both sides agreed on a peace treaty that ended the annual tributes to the Jin. Diplomatic missions between the Jin and Song were also cut off.\n\n## Mongol–Song alliance\n\nIn February 1233, the Mongols took Kaifeng after a siege of more than 10 months and the Jin court retreated to the town of Caizhou. In 1233 Emperor Aizong (r. 1224–1234) of the Jin dispatched diplomats to implore the Song for supplies. Jin envoys reported to the Song that the Mongols would invade the Song after they were done with the Jin—a forecast that would later be proven true—but the Song ignored the warning and rebuffed the request. They instead formed an alliance with the Mongols against the Jin. The Song provided supplies to the Mongols in return for parts of Henan. The Jin dynasty collapsed when Mongol and Song troops defeated the Jurchens at the siege of Caizhou in 1234. General Meng Gong () led the Song army against Caizhou. The penultimate emperor of the Jin, Emperor Aizong, took his own life. His short-lived successor, Emperor Mo, was killed in the town a few days later. The Mongols later turned their sights towards the Song. After decades of war, the Song dynasty also fell in 1279, when the remaining Song loyalists lost to the Mongols in a naval battle near Guangdong.\n\n## Cultural and demographic changes\n\nJurchen migrants from the northeastern reaches of Jin territory settled in the Jin-controlled lands of northern China. Constituting less than ten percent of the total population, the two to three million ruling Jurchens were a minority in a region that was still dominated by 30 million Han Chinese. The southward expansion of the Jurchens caused the Jin to transition their decentralized government of semi-agrarian tribes to a bureaucratic Chinese-style dynasty.\n\nThe Jin government initially promoted an independent Jurchen culture alongside their adoption of the centralized Chinese imperial bureaucracy, but the empire was gradually sinicized over time. The Jurchens became fluent in the Chinese language, and the philosophy of Confucianism was used to legitimize the ruling government. Confucian state rituals were adopted during the reign of Emperor Xizong (1135–1150). The Jin implemented imperial exams on the Confucian Classics, first regionally and then for the entire empire. The Classics and other works of Chinese literature were translated into Jurchen and studied by Jin intellectuals, but very few Jurchens actively contributed to the classical literature of the Jin. The Khitan script, from the Chinese family of scripts, formed the basis of a national writing system for the empire, the Jurchen script. All three scripts were working languages of the government. Jurchen clans adopted Chinese personal names with their Jurchen names. Wanyan Liang (Prince of Hailing; r. 1150–1161) was an enthusiastic proponent of Jurchen sinicization and enacted policies to encourage it. Wanyan Liang had been acculturated by Song diplomats from childhood, and his emulation of Song practices earned him the Jurchen nickname of \"aping the Chinese\". He studied the Chinese classics, drank tea, and played Chinese chess for recreation. Under his reign, the administrative core of the Jin state was moved south from Huining. He instated Beijing as the Jin main capital in 1153. Palaces were erected in Beijing and Kaifeng, while the original, more northerly residences of Jurchen chieftains were demolished.\n\nThe emperor's political reforms were connected with his desire to conquer all of China and to legitimize himself as a Chinese emperor. The prospect of conquering southern China was cut short by Wanyan Liang's assassination. Wanyan Liang's successor, Emperor Shizong, was less enthusiastic about sinicization and reversed several of Wanyan Liang's edicts. He sanctioned new policies with the intent to slow the assimilation of the Jurchens. Shizong's prohibitions were abandoned by Emperor Zhangzong (r. 1189–1208), who promoted reforms that transformed the political structure of the dynasty closer to that of the Song and Tang dynasties. Despite cultural and demographic changes, military hostilities between the Jin and the Song persisted until the fall of the Jin.\n\nIn the south, the retreat of the Song dynasty led to major demographic changes. The population of refugees from the north that resettled in Lin'an and Jiankang (modern Hangzhou and Nanjing) eventually grew greater than the population of original residents, whose numbers had dwindled from repeated Jurchen raids. The government encouraged the resettlement of peasant migrants from the southern provinces of the Song to the underpopulated territories between the Yangtze and the Huai rivers.\n\nThe new capital Lin'an grew into a major commercial and cultural center. It rose from a middling city of no special importance to one of the world's largest and most prosperous. During his stay in Lin'an in the Yuan dynasty (1260–1368), when the city was not as wealthy as it had been under the Song, Marco Polo remarked that \"this city is greater than any in the world\". Once retaking northern China became less plausible and Lin'an grew into a significant trading city, the government buildings were extended and renovated to better befit its status as an imperial capital. The modestly sized imperial palace was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nThe loss of northern China, the cultural center of Chinese civilization, diminished the regional status of the Song dynasty. After the Jurchen conquest of the north, Korea recognized the Jin, not the Song, as the legitimate dynasty of China. The Song's military failures reduced it to a subordinate of the Jin, turning it into a \"China among equals\". The Song economy, however, recovered quickly after the move south. Government revenues earned from taxing foreign trade nearly doubled between the closing of the Northern Song era in 1127 and the final years of Gaozong's reign in the early 1160s. The recovery was not uniform, and areas like Huainan and Hubei that had been directly affected by the war took decades to return to their pre-war levels. In spite of multiple wars, the Jin remained one of the main trading partners of the Song. Song demand for foreign products like fur and horses went unabated. Historian believes that Song commerce with the north was profitable enough that it compensated for the silver delivered annually as an indemnity to the Jin.\n\nThe Jin–Song Wars were one of several wars in northern China along with the Uprising of the Five Barbarians, An Lushan Rebellion, Huang Chao Rebellion and the wars of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms which caused a mass migration of Han Chinese from northern China to southern China called \"\" (). In 1126–1127 over half a million fled from northern China to southern China including Li Qingzhao. One section of the Confucius family led by Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou moved south to Quzhou with Southern Song emperor Gaozong while his brother Kong Duancao remained behind in Qufu and became the Duke Yansheng for the Jin dynasty. A section of the Zengzi family also moved south with the Southern Song while the other part of the Zengzi family stayed in the north.\n\nHowever, there was also a reverse migration when the war was over of Han Chinese from the Southern Song towards Jin ruled northern China leading southern China's population to shrink and northern China's population to grow.\n\n## Gunpowder warfare\n\nThe battles between the Song and the Jin spurred the invention and use of gunpowder weapons. There are reports that the fire lance, one of the earliest ancestors of the firearm, was used by the Song against the Jurchens besieging De'an (; modern Anlu in eastern Hubei) in 1132, during the Jin invasion of Hubei and Shaanxi. The weapon consisted of a spear attached with a flamethrower capable of firing projectiles from a barrel constructed of bamboo or paper. They were built by soldiers under the command of Chen Gui (), who led the Song army defending De'an. The fire lances with which Song soldiers were equipped at De'an were built for destroying the wooden siege engines of the Jin and not for combat against the Jin infantry. Song soldiers compensated for the limited range and mobility of the weapon by timing their attacks on the Jin siege engines, waiting until they were within range of the fire lances. Later fire lances used metal barrels, fired projectiles farther and with greater force, and could be used against infantry.\n\nEarly rudimentary bombs like the huopao fire bomb () and the huopao () bombs propelled by trebuchet were also in use as incendiary weapons. The defending Song army used huopao () during the first Jin siege of Kaifeng in 1126. On the opposing side, the Jin launched incendiary bombs from siege towers down onto the city below. In 1127, huopao () were employed by the Song troops defending De'an and by the Jin soldiers besieging the city. The government official Lin Zhiping () proposed to make incendiary bombs and arrows mandatory for all warships in the Song navy. At the battle of Caishi in 1161, Song ships fired pili huoqiu (), also called pili huopao bombs (), from trebuchets against the ships of the Jin fleet commanded by Wanyan Liang. The gunpowder mixture of the bomb contained powdered lime, which produced blinding smoke once the casing of the bomb shattered. The Song also deployed incendiary weapons at the battle of Tangdao during the same year.\n\nGunpowder was also applied to arrows in 1206 by a Song army stationed in Xiangyang. The arrows were most likely an incendiary weapon, but its function may also have resembled that of an early rocket. At the Jin siege of Qizhou () in 1221, the Jurchens fought the Song with gunpowder bombs and arrows. The Jin tiehuopao (, \"iron huopao\"), which had cast iron casings, are the first known hard casing bombs. The bomb needed to be capable of detonating in order to penetrate the iron casing. The Song army had a large supply of incendiary bombs, but there are no reports of them having a weapon similar to the Jin's detonating bombs. A participant in the siege recounted in the Xinsi Qi Qi Lu (辛巳泣蘄錄) that the Song army at Qizhou had an arsenal of 3000 huopao (), 7000 incendiary gunpowder arrows for crossbows and 10000 for bows, as well as 20000 pidapao (), probably leather bags filled with gunpowder.\n\n## See also\n\n* History of the Song dynasty\n\n* Timeline of the Jin–Song wars\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* (hardcover)\n\n* \n\n* (hardcover)\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* (hardcover)\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* (hardcover); (paperback).\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* (hardcover)\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n \n12th century in China\n13th century in China\nWars involving the Song dynasty\n1120s in Asia\n1130s in Asia\n1125 in Asia\n1134 in Asia"}

{"id": "43000728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Audierne%20Bay", "title": "Battle of Audierne Bay", "text": "The Battle of the Audierne Bay was an engagement between German and Allied naval flotillas that took place on 23 August 1944, during World War II. Three Allied warships, which had already established control off the coast of Brittany and were lurking off Audierne south of the invested fortress of Brest, intercepted and sank eight German vessels of an armed convoy. This was the conclusion of Operation Kinetic; an allied plan to intercept shipping and hinder Germans besieged at Brest.\n\n## Background\n\nBy 11 August, the Mortain counter-offensive had ground to a halt. To the east, US forces took Argentan on 13 August while British and Canadian forces closed in toward Falaise from the north, thus initiating the drive to encircle and destroy two German armies inside the Falaise Pocket. As the siege of the Breton ports continued, the focus of the war was quickly shifting further east.\n\nOperation Kinetic had been set up by the Royal Navy Command Headquarters; the objective of which was to eliminate the German navy all along the French Atlantic ports. Of three Forces of Kinetic - Force 27 under the command of William Davis, consisting of the light cruiser HMS Mauritius and the destroyers HMS Ursa and HMCS Iroquois, departed Plymouth on 13 August to carry out a new patrol along the central section of the Biscay coast. With the Germans under the command of Marinegruppenkommando West on the move to evacuate by sea, the ongoing Kinetic had already scored two successes and was finalizing for the naval offensive in the Bay of Biscay to complete the success.\n\nOn the night of 22/23 August, under orders from naval intelligence the cruiser HMS Mauritius and the destroyers HMCS Iroquois and HMS Ursa were patrolling Audierne Bay between Brest and Lorient and radar soon picked up a large contact heading towards them.\n\n## Battles\n\nDavis ordered Iroquois; the ship closest to the contact, commanded by James Calcutt Hibbard to use the Type 293 radar and relay the information to the rest of the force. Hibbard placed so much confidence in the radar that he decided to direct the opening moves from the Action Information Centre rather than the bridge, and then gave the order to illuminate with star shell. As a result, Force 27 was able to close undetected and launched a surprise attack on the known convoy which were three ships.\n\nAt 0213 Iroquois scored the first hit on flak ship, which was subsequently set on fire. A second flak ship was quickly destroyed by the heavy guns from Mauritius, while another was set on fire and driven onto the shoals. Only nineteen minutes after opening fire, all three German ships had been put out of action, with two sunk and the third aground and burning.\n\nIn a second action two hours later, Iroquois detected another convoy of four ships departing from the harbour of Brest: an M-class minesweeper, two flak ships and a converted mine-destructor ship, or \"Sperrbrecher\". Using the radar on Iroquois again, Force 27 stalked the convoy at long range until 0408, when the German ships were illuminated with star shell. Upon opening fire, the British and Canadians quickly overwhelmed the convoy sinking two vessels and causing two others to collide in the confusion and burst into flames as they raced for shore, with surviving crew members jumping over the side as they went. One of these vessels capsized and sank while the other drove onto the rocks at full speed and exploded.\n\nAt dawn, Force 27 continued with another sweep around Audierne Bay in order to confirm the destruction of the German convoy. In the process a minesweeper came into view and was pounded with gunfire and driven onto a reef near Port Audierne. Iroquois finished off the minesweeper with a torpedo, while Ursa sent on a boarding party onto the other grounded vessel to grab eleven prisoners. The other one hundred and fifty survivors who were able to swim to shore were subsequently taken prisoner by the French Resistance. This was the last part of the action and the force consolidated and reviewed the damage they had caused.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe final tally for the night was eight ships destroyed: one minesweeper driven ashore and heavily damaged, a flak ship, five armed trawlers, and the Sperrbrecher. Iroquois alone had fired a total of 1,197 rounds of 4.7-inch along with 231 rounds of star shell. Davis in his report attributed the success of the night's action to two principal causes: \"some lucky guesses, and the excellence of Iroquois''' radar and plotting teams\". Although not known to Davis, it was actually Ultra intelligence that bore some responsibility for the luck of those guesses.\n\nIn the last week of August, another naval operation commenced, this time called Operation Assault'', during which the cruiser HMS Bellona patrolled along the Biscay coast from Belle Isle near Lorient to Arcachon Point, south-west of Bordeaux. Continuing these sweeps through the remainder of the month, the Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy patrolled off the coast. They sent landing parties ashore on the French mainland and outlying islands to secure them and ensured they were eliminated as potential bases of logistical supply to the Germans. The blockade of these Biscay ports, however, achieved impressive results independent of the campaign on land.\n\nBy the close of the Operation Kinetic, the combined Allied naval and air offensive eventually resulted in the reorganization of Kriegsmarine forces operating from fortress ports along the coast into Marineoberkommando West.\n\n## External links\n\n* \n\nAudierne Bay\nAudierne Bay\nNaval battles of World War II involving Germany\nConflicts in 1944\nAugust 1944"}

It is constructed from steel uprights and beams, in-filled with concrete floor slabs and brick exterior walls. It was built in 1938; the foundation stone was placed by Bishop Eugène van Rechem. Extensions were made in the 1960s to the dining hall and chapel above and the JCR (junior common room) and the chapel annexe was added. The Broadway building contains inter alia the residential area for the boarders, classrooms, sixth form centre, head's and their deputy's offices and some of the college administration staff.\n\nThe middle school building was built in 1919 and Mrs Annie Besant, president of the Theosophical education trust, laid what was then a cornerstone to mark the occasion. With later additions in 1924 the cornerstone became a single faced stone in the east wall of the building. It is, in part, two storeys high, organised around a central courtyard, within which is a temporary building.\n\nThe theatre and gymnasium were built in 1924 at the same time as the northern part of middle school and again the foundation stone was laid by the, later, Dr Annie Besant. The theatre has seating for 330 although the originally capacity was 600. Originally it was intended to be an assembly hall, but at the eleventh hour the design was altered to add a fly tower and create a theatre. The statue of St Francis, above the entrance, was added in 1937. Well known in its heyday (Olivier is believed to have made his first stage appearance here, as a babe-in-arms) the theatre became dilapidated in the 1980s, but the auditorium and stage were refurbished in 2001/02 with further improvements to the foyer and other areas in 2003/04. The prep. department building, a two-storey brick building with basement, was constructed in the 1940s with an extension in the late 1960s.\n\nOn-site recreation and sporting facilities include a 20-metre indoor heated swimming pool built in the early 1970s, five tarmac tennis/netball courts, a sports field and adjacent grassed sports/playing area. The prep school is provided, to the north of the Broadway building, in a modern and separate building, with an all-weather play area extending into an enclosed garden.\n\n## Notable former pupils\n\n* Jennie Bond, previously the BBC royal correspondent, attended St Francis' College.\n\n* Nicola Fox, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate\n\n* Adenike Grange, former Nigerian minister in charge of the Federal Ministry of Health.\n\n* Claire Slater, actress, attended the school.\n\n## External links\n\n* \n\n* ISI inspection reports\n\n* Ofsted boarding inspection report\n\nPrivate schools in Hertfordshire\nGirls' schools in Hertfordshire\nEducational institutions established in 1933\n1933 establishments in England\nMember schools of the Girls' Schools Association\nBoarding schools in Hertfordshire\nLetchworth\nBuildings and structures in Letchworth"}

The Stellingwerff/Theunissen distillery was located along the Nieuwe Demer, where most of Hasselt's distilleries were located in the 18th century. It bordered Hasselt's beguinage.\n\n## History\n\nOriginally, the distillery was a convent farm run by the Sisters of St Francis of Penance – popularly known as the white nuns – whose convent Sint-Catharinadal was on the other side of the street.\n\n## Stellingwerff\n\nDuring the French occupation, monastic properties were confiscated and sold. In 1803, Jean Antoine Séraphin Bamps (1776-1842) bought the convent farm and set up a jenever distillery. A few years later, in 1807, he sold the farm and its distillery to tobacco manufacturer and trader Leo Vaesen, who operated the distillery until his death in 1822.\n\nWhen Leo Vaesen died, the distillery passed – via his sister Maria-Catherina Vaesen, widow of Guillaume Joseph Stellingwerff (1763-1814) – to the Stellingwerff family. Maria-Catherina lived there with her priest brother Nicolaas Gerard. They carried out a number of important renovation works: the distillery wing, for instance, was given an extra floor and an attic and converted into a house. \n\nAfter Maria-Catherina's death in 1843, her son Adam Nicolaas Leon Stellingwerff (1798-1876) inherited the distillery. He ran it together with his brother Leon Joseph Victor (1805-1888). In 1850, the distillery was given its current appearance: a Neoclassical façade with a central gate.\n\nFollowing Adam's death in 1876, Leon Joseph Victor continued the distillery, together with his cousins Victor Guillaume Gustave and Leon Hubert Joseph. When Leon Joseph Victor died in 1890, the two cousins sold the distillery to Godfried Vanrusselt and Paul Jozef Theunissen.\n\n## Theunissen\n\nIn 1891 Godfried Vanrusselt sold his shares to Jean Leonard Brauns, who partnered with Paul Jozef Theunissen until 1904, after which Theunissen continued alone. In 1912, one of the livestock sheds was converted into a liqueur factory. When Paul Jozef Theunissen died in 1927, he was succeeded by his sons Léon and Joseph Theunissen.\n\nThe distillery produced grain alcohol until World War II. After the war, until around 1965, it produced liqueurs on a limited scale. In the 1970s the buildings fell into an increasing state of disrepair.\n\n## Jenever Museum\n\nOn 21 August, 1975 the buildings of the former Stellingwerff/Theunissen distillery were protected by royal decree as Flanders’ first industrial-archaeological monument. A few years later, in 1979, Hasselt city council bought them with the intention of housing a museum there. The restoration work – funded by European, provincial and government grants – started in the spring of 1983 and was completed in July 1987. The museum opened its doors on 16 September of that same year.\n\n## References\n\nDistilleries\nHasselt"}

It was originally called Bluff Springs by pioneers who settled nearby; Bluff Dale became the town name when the post office was established in 1877. In 1889, when the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railway was built, Jack Glenn donated land for the development of a town. The town was incorporated in 1908. By 1915, a bank and newspaper had been developed. In 1936, Bluff Dale had 680 residents, 500 in 1940, 123 in 1980, and 300 in 1989. In 1989, the town had a Garden Club, three churches, a volunteer fire department, five historical markers, and a beautification committee. A gas station–convenience store was built circa 2002.

Mosby and Criser were part of a political stratagem called massive resistance.\n\n## Construction and funding\n\nThe school was initially proposed by Chuck Leadman, business agent of the local branch of the Textile Workers Union of America. Leadman solicited $1-per-week donations from his union members to pay for its construction. Leadman described Front Royal as a racial \"utopia\" free of violence, although the local white population fired live ammunition at a black church when its pastor opposed the project. When the Textile Workers Union international learned of Leadman's project, they froze the local's assets and seized the donations. A court upheld their actions and Leadman was subsequently removed from his position.\n\nWith the union funding seized, tuition at Mosby was covered in part by state tuition grants. Grants to a \"nonprofit, nonsectarian private school\", even segregation academies, were upheld by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 9, 1965, in Griffin v.

He described numerous plants and published several richly illustrated works. He also brought together a rich collections of medical books of the period gathering nearly 34000 books which were donated to the University of Altdorf and later moved to the Erlangen University library.\n\n## Life and work\n\nTrew was born in Lauf near Nuremberg where his father was a chemist. He graduated in medicine from the University of Altdorf in 1717. His dissertation was made under the surgeon and botanist Lorenz Heister (1683–1758). He then travelled as part of the peregrinatio academica or grand tour around Europe for three years, making friends in Switzerland, Leiden, Danzig and Königsberg. He also collected books and works. In 1720 Heister moved to Helmstedt and recommended Trew as a replacement for his position. This was however not accepted and he returned in 1720 to his hometown as a general practitioner. He continued to keep a correspondence with physicians and botanists he met on his travels. He was originally a city solicitor, court physician, Count Palatine of the Holy Roman Empire, an advisor to the Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. In 1721 he settled in Nuremberg as a physician and in 1723 he married a wealthy widow ten years older than him and acquired a large house in 1728 where he grew plants and grew his library. He was then elected to the local Collegium Medicum and supervised the Nuremberg's Theatrum Anatomicum as well as the Hortus Medicus, where plants of use in medicine where grown. He made use of these two positions while studying plants, getting help from students and illustrators. In 1730 he sought to produce an illustrated Opus anatomicum in six to eight volumes but only realized one part on the anatomy of the skull. Along with other colleagues he founded a journal Commercium Litterarium, ad rei medicae et scientiae naturali incrementum (Learned Correspondence to the Advancement of Medicine and the Natural Sciences) in 1731. He was a member of the Leopoldina Academy and the Royal Society of London (elected 17 April 1746), the Berlin Academy, and the Florentine Botanical Society. His interest in botany then led him to sponsor the publication of illustrated botanical books.\n\nIn 1732, Christoph Jacob Trew saw some of Georg Ehret's drawings. Ehret was a botanist and illustrator, from Heidelberg, Germany. Liking them, Trew then became Ehret's patron. Ehret sent many paintings to Trew over the next few years. Between 1750 and 1773 Trew began Plantae Selectae Quarum Imagines (it was published in Nuremberg). It has many illustrations by Georg Ehret. Trew wrote the plant descriptions. Up to 16 new names of plants were published by Trew in the series; including Cochliasanthus . Benedict Christoph Vogel completed some of the unfinished works of Trew after his death in 1769.\n\nIn 1914, botanists Pax & K.Hoffm. erected the monotypic African genus Afrotrewia in the family Euphorbiaceae, named in Trew's honour.\n\n## External links\n\n* Trew library - digitized collections\n\n* Trew correspondence\n\n* \n\n* \n\n1695 births\n1769 deaths\nPeople from Lauf an der Pegnitz\nCourt physicians\n18th-century German botanists\nFellows of the Royal Society\n18th-century German physicians"}

Her namesake is a black variant of jaguars or leopards.\n\n## Design and description\n\nShe has a displacement of 99 tons, length 111'6\", beam 17'9\", draft 5'6\", speed 15 knots, complement 16. Her armaments consist of 2 2-pounders (dual purpose), 2 .30 caliber machine guns, 2 depth charge tracks, 1 depth charge projector (Y-gun).\n\n## Construction and career\n\nThe vessel was built at the Leblanc Shipbuilding Co. at Weymouth, Nova Scotia. She was laid down in 1942 and launched on 17 June 1942. The ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy by Lt. Cmdr. Freeborn of the Royal Canadian Navy and commissioned as submarine chaser SC-1470 at her building yard on 23 October 1942.\n\n## 1942\n\nSC-1470 got underway for Digby, Nova Scotia, at 15:16 on 27 October 1942, but paused briefly alongside the Weymouth North Government Wharf to await her sister ship SC-1471, after which time she resumed her passage out of Weymouth. The new submarine chaser carried out gunnery trials on the 30th, expending 25 rounds of 2-pounder ammunition, two 300-pound depth charges, one Y-gun impulse charge, seven Holman projector grenades, and two hand flares. She reached Digby the next day.\n\nUnderway for the Boston Navy Yard at 10:30 on 31 October 1942, again in company with SC-1471, the two vessels became separated during the trip, necessitating SC-1470’s firing a flare and three rounds of 2-pounder ammunition “to enable her to locate us.” SC-1471 regained position at 08:52 on 1 November. Almost an hour into the afternoon watch, SC-1470 moored alongside SC-1463 at the Boston Navy Yard's South Boston Annex. The next afternoon, the submarine chaser shifted to another pier, alongside an ammunition lighter to which she transferred booster charges, Holman grenades and impulse cartridges for their projectors, depth charges, pistols, 2-pounder shells, impulse charges, signal flares and arbors, returning thence to her previous mooring.\n\nCompleting her fitting-out period on 23 November 1942, the vessel was rearmed at Boston, with U.S. 3-inch/23 caliber guns replacing the British 2-pounder weapons with which she had been equipped. SC-1470 got underway on 30 November to conduct structural firing trials. She expended three Mk. VII depth charges, four rounds of 3-inch/23 caliber, and 75 rounds of 20 millimeter before the port Oerlikon jammed after 40 rounds and the barrel could not be removed.\n\nHaving reported to Commander in Chief U.S. Fleet (ComInCh) and Commander Eastern Sea Frontier for shakedown and onwards routing on 2 December 1942, SC-1470 continued fitting out at Boston until 4 December, when she sailed four minutes into the forenoon watch in company with SC-1471 and SC-766, bound for Tompkinsville, Staten Island. Proceeding via the Cape Cod Canal, she reached New Bedford harbor later that afternoon, remaining there until the following morning, when she sailed for Port Jefferson harbor, reaching her destination at 18:00 and mooring alongside SC-766 at the ferry docks there. SC-1470 ultimately reached Tompkinsville shortly after mid-day on 6 December.\n\n## 1943\n\nAfter undergoing alterations at Tompkinsville through mid-January 1943, SC-1470 sailed on 21 January in accordance with Commander Eastern Sea Frontier orders to proceed to Miami, Florida, in company with SC-1471 and report to the commanding officer of the Submarine Chaser Training Center (SCTC). Upon completing her shakedown, SC-1470 was then to report to Commander Gulf Sea Frontier for onward routing to the Caribbean.\n\nPausing to fuel at the Naval Operating Base, Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 January 1943, SC-1470 and SC-1471 continued on, encountering heavy fog off Frying Pan Shoals late on the 24th. Lt. Parker ordered engines slowed to two-thirds speed, stationed a lookout in the eyes of the ship, and had the navigation lights turned on. Eventually, shortly before the start of the mid watch, the fog cleared enough for the ships to resume standard speed. Stopping again, at the Section Base at Charleston, late on 25 January, SC-1470 resumed her coastwise passage after a brief fog-induced delay the following morning. She fueled at the Section Base at Mayport, on the morning of the 27th, and stood into the swept channel at Miami at 16:10 on the 28th.\n\nSC-1470 got underway for her shakedown on 3 February 1943, then conducted a night patrol encompassing an area from five miles east of the sea buoy that lay to the southwest, to five miles abeam of the Fowey Rocks Light. She stood in to moor at Pier 2, SCTC at 05:40 on the 4th.   She then conducted her gunnery shakedown on the 7th, as well as ran various emergency drills. On the morning of 8 February, SC-1470 transferred her allowance of 16 Mousetrap projectiles ashore, the equipment removed and delivered to the SCTC. She then began a period of maintenance and minor repairs that continued until the 12th, after which time she shifted to a berth alongside the County Causeway. A brief interval underway on 15 February, with student officers and SCTC faculty on board, and formation steaming off Miami Beach in company with SC-1467, SC-1469 and her old running mate SC-1471, punctuated that availability period that continued into late February. As that month drew to a close, she “painted ship” on the 22nd, took on supplies, underwent an inspection on the 24th by Capt. Benson on the staff of the Commandant of the Seventh Naval District, and the following day by Cmdr. Olson, the Port Director at Miami. On the 26th, workmen removed the Marconi wireless gear that had equipped the ship when commissioned, replacing it with new equipment, a process concluded the following day.\n\n## Collision with PC-1123\n\nAfter undergoing alterations and taking on supplies (1-4 March 1943), SC-1470 stood out to sea on 5 March. At 22:37 that day, SC-1470 passed Molasses Reef Light abeam to starboard, 1.5 miles away. An hour later, she changed course in response to orders from the officer in tactical command, but at 23:54 sighted a ship on her starboard beam “heading toward us on a collision course.” SC-1470’s officer of the deck ordered “hard left rudder,” but the steel-hulled submarine chaser PC-1123, the approaching ship, plowed into the wooden-hulled vessel and rammed a hole in the starboard side of the engine room, the damage extending from the gunwale to below the waterline, flooding that compartment and putting all electrical circuits out of commission. PC-1123’s several attempts to come alongside and pass a towline only caused further damage -- to SC-1470’s port side above the waterline -- when the heavy seas pushed the ships together. Finally, shortly before the end of the mid watch on 6 March, PC-1123 managed to get a line to the damaged vessel and set course for Miami.\n\nPassing the sea buoy at the mouth of the Miami River at 16:55 on 6 March 1943, SC-1470 cast off from PC-1123 five minutes later and hoisted “not under command” signals until a tug could arrive. A navy tug came alongside about two and a half hours later, taking the tow line at 1935, and turned the damaged ship over to the district tug YT-333 (ex-Daniel Ladd) at 20:30, the latter taking SC-1470 to the Dade Drydock Co. yard, where the submarine chaser immediately entered a floating drydock at 20:47. Yard workmen began repair work almost immediately, and installed a soft patch on the starboard side on the 7th. Workmen removed all ammunition, work continuing throughout the day, while Lt. Cone H. Johnson, USNR, the commanding officer, noted “several inspections by interested officials.” The following afternoon [8 March], SC-1470 was taken from the drydock by YT-333, and moored to the north side of Pier 2 at the SCTC. YT-333 took the vessel to a berth at the County Causeway, where all fuel was removed from the damaged ship, then back to Pier 2, where SC-1470 “awaited orders” for the remainder of March.\n\nThose who inspected the ship at Miami deemed SC-1470 to require two months for repairs. Subsequently, ComInCh suggested on 19 May 1943 that “if [SC-1470 was] so badly damaged that she may be scratched from the Navy list or even be subject to long repairs” the ship be turned over to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO). Her assignment to the Caribbean Sea Frontier cancelled by ComInCh, SC-1470 was accordingly turned over to the VCNO for further disposition by the Commander of the Operational Training Command, Atlantic, on 24 May 1943.\n\nRedesignated as a “miscellaneous” type of vessel, of an “unclassified” nature, SC-1470 was named Panther and given the identification number IX-105 on 26 June 1943. She was assigned to the Seventh Naval District on 1 July 1943.

{"id": "18969997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KidZui", "title": "KidZui", "text": "KidZui was a web browser designed for children developed by KidZui, Inc. The KidZui browser used a Zooming User Interface paradigm to make browsing easier for children. Search results appeared as scaled-down images of websites, videos, and pictures that children click on to zoom in and see the content. Children can also browse by category without typing search terms. The KidZui browser did not access the open Internet. KidZui uses teachers and parents to screen content and maintains a database of approved URLs. The KidZui browser could only access URLs in the approved database. Children built avatars called Zuis to represent themselves online. They earned points for web browsing and used points to gain levels and buy clothes and accessories for their Zuis. Children could share KidZui content with friends online. To add a friend online, children needed to know the friends Zui name. There was no online directory of Zui names, so children needed to get their friends Zui names offline in order to add them. Friends also needed to be approved by parents before they become available in the browser. KidZui also tracked children's Internet usage and sends reports to their parents on what their children looked at online.\n\nKidZui began development on the product in the summer of 2006. After beta testing, KidZui was offered to the general public on March 19, 2008. The KidZui browser and basic reports for parents are free. KidZui makes revenue through a paid membership program. Membership gives kids additional features like more available clothing and accessories for Zuis, more background and themes, and the ability to get to higher levels with points. Membership gives parents more reporting capabilities to track their children's online activity, and more ways to customize the KidZui browser for their children.\n\nKidZui was designed for children between the ages of 3 and 12 years old. KidZui had a focus on children's online safety, but they also tried to expand the content available to children online. Rather than solely using filters, KidZui trained and enlisted parents and teachers to search out content that is appropriate for children even if it was not designed expressly for children. Websites that had been reviewed and approved by KidZui could carry a KidZui seal of approval that indicates the site's content is appropriate for children. Websites that carried the seal agree to abide by KidZui's content guidelines. KidZui was also a prize on the 3rd round on the Nickelodeon game show BrainSurge.\n\nIn August 2014, LeapFrog purchased KidZui. The KidZui terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\n## History and development\n\nKidZui was started in 2006 when Vidar Vignisson was frustrated because he couldn't find a safe and easy way for his own children to use the Internet. Vignisson joined with Cliff Boro and Thomas Broadhead to create KidZui. Prior to founding KidZui, Vignisson, Boro, and Broadhead had been partners on other Internet startups including Infogate, which they sold to AOL Time Warner in March 2003.\n\nVignisson was frustrated by the approach of existing technologies that were available at the time; online filters helped keep out dangerous content, but could only be used in conjunction with adult browsers, which are hard for children to use. Existing children's browsers were easier to use but had access to very small amounts of content. Vignisson, Boro, and Broadhead set out to build an easy-to-use children's browser with access to a large and diverse set of online content and activities.\n\nKidZui is a venture backed startup. Investors include Maveron, Emergence Capital, and First Round Capital.\n\nPrior to founding KidZui, Vignisson, Boro, and Broadhead had been partners on other Internet startups including Infogate, which they sold to AOL Time Warner (later Time Warner, now WarnerMedia) in March 2003.\n\nKidZui began beta testing with children in 2006. KidZui was released to the general public on March 19, 2008 to generally favorable reviews. The original release of KidZui required a paid subscription. KidZui experienced some early criticism for not offering a free version of the product. The company released a free version on June 4, 2008. The free version of the product offers the same features as the original subscription-based product. KidZui introduced a membership program that same month. The membership program unlocks additional features in the kids’ browser and comes with more advanced reporting features for parents.\n\n## ZuiTube\n\nZuiTube was the online video destination that used KidZui's catalogue of kid-friendly video content. ZuiTube used a user interface designed for children. ZuiTube provided a \"Play All\" mode that allowed kids to watch all videos within a specific channel without interruption, as well as an \"auto complete\" search feature with smart-type that optimized results based on popularity, or \"Kid Rank.\" ZuiTube also offered KidZui-user-generated video channels as an opportunity for kids to both enjoy and express themselves within KidZui's community of users.\n\nZuiTube.com launched in August 2009. The website launch was followed by the release of the ZuiTube App for iPhone and iPod Touch. As of July 2016, the domain name is no longer registered and the app has been pulled from the iOS app store.\n\n## Business model\n\nThe basic version of KidZui with access to all content was free. Revenue came exclusively from paid memberships. It is not clear what percentage of families used the free version versus paying for membership. KidZui included advertisements to children in their browser, mostly based on sponsored partnerships with Under Armour, Mattel, and Comcast.\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nKidZui used filters to pre-screen content. After screening by filters, the content was reviewed by paid teachers and parents using a set of content guidelines.\n\nIn 2007, KidZui hired Deanne Kells, a former vice president and Editor in Chief from LeapFrog, to establish the content guidelines and a process for reviewing and approving content. Kells used childhood developmental principles to form a content screening protocol where content is first determined to be appropriate for children, and then classified by age for developmental level and reading ability.\n\n## Browser features\n\nKidZui used a Zooming User Interface paradigm where search results are displayed visually at a smaller scale. Children clicked on images to enlarge them. The visual interface made it easier for children to browse without advanced reading skills. KidZui also had category browsing that allowed children to explore the Internet using categories based on popularity or similarity. KidZui had an auto search complete feature that returns results after only typing one or two letters. KidZui offered to complete search terms using the most popular searches by other children and it showed search results as children type.\n\n## See also\n\n* ZuiTube\n\n## External links\n\n* KidZui Official Site (archived)\n\n* KidZui Firefox Add-on\n\n* CVT Ventures\n\n* Video Egg\n\n* Maveron\n\n* Emergence Capital\n\n* First Round Capital\n\n* Kideos\n\nWeb browsers\nDiscontinued web browsers"}

His area of study included Southeast Asian history (especially of the Philippines), foreign relations of the United States, and Chicano history.\n\n## Biography\n\nMay was born in Brooklyn in 1945. May studied at Yale University for his undergraduate degree. After graduating in 1966, he served in the Vietnam War. When his military service was complete, he returned to Yale where he received a PhD in history. At some point he would also marry Helen Liu; the two would have three children together.\n\nMay's main research focus has been on the History of the Philippines. His works include:\n\n* Social Engineering in the Philippines: The Aims, Execution, and Impact of American Colonial Policy, 1900-1913 (Greenwood Press, 1980, )\n\n* A Past Recovered: Essays on Philippine History and Historiography (New Day, 1987, )\n\n* Battle for Batangas: A Philippine Province at War (Yale University Press, 1991, )\n\n* Inventing a Hero: The Posthumous Re-Creation of Andres Bonifacio (University of Wisconsin, Center for Southeast Asian Studies, 1996, ) Sonny Montes and Mexican American Activism in Oregon (2010).\n\nMay's work has been influential. His 1980 book, based on his PhD work, was published at a time when US control of the Philippines was generally thought to have led to rather positive results, was much more skeptical of the benefits of American rule. May's 1996 work on the historiography of Andrés Bonifacio attracted controversy, Inventing a Hero: The Posthumous Re-Creation of Andres Bonifacio''. In it, May argued that much of the commonly accepted knowledge of Bonifacio were based on unverifiable or forged documents, and was a myth disconnected from the real Bonifacio. As Bonifacio is a Philippine national icon, this attracted pushback from those who wished to defend the standard version of Bonifacio's story. May also criticized the work of historian John Leddy Phelan on the Philippines under Spanish rule in 2004, in particular his claim that the Spanish began a process of changing communally held property into private property. Rather, May said, old Spanish documents indicate that the disputes of the era involved disputes with existing landholders - while the Spanish did take land, it appears it was from pre-existing owners in the Filipino elite, not from a commons.\n\nMay died on November 10, 2020.\n\n## External links\n\n* Here’s a way to immortalize the fools of Wall Street , Glenn Anthony May.\n\n1945 births\n2020 deaths\n20th-century American historians\nAmerican male non-fiction writers\n21st-century American historians\nHistorians of the Philippines\nUniversity of Oregon faculty\nYale University alumni"}

She made a Grand Tour from 1801 to 1803 and documented her experiences through letters, including encounters with notable figures like Napoleon Bonaparte. She later traveled to Russia to join her sister Martha Wilmot and lived there from 1805 to 1807. She later moved to France and died in Paris in 1824. Her writings, letters, and diaries provide insight on the Napoleonic era, on the Russian society and on travel in the 19th century. Her works also include her sister's transcript of the memoirs of Princess Dashkova.\n\n## Life\n\nCatherine Wilmot was born in Drogheda, County Louth, to Edward and Martha Wilmot (née Moore). She was the eldest daughter of six daughters and three sons. Her father was the port surveyor in Drogheda, having previously served as captain in the 40th Regiment of Foot. He was transferred to a similar post in County Cork in 1775, where Wilmot was raised. The family settled in Glanmire, near the seat of the Earl of Mountcashell in Moore Park. The earl's family used the surname Moore.\n\nWilmot was friendly with Lady Mountcashell, formerly Margaret King, an early and eager pupil of Mary Wollstonecraft. Wilmot was invited to accompany the party of Stephen Moore, 2nd Earl Mount Cashell, and his wife on a grand tour of the continent. Her letters from the time survive, in France from November 1801 to October 1802, and in Italy until July 1803. The Mount Cashells entertained lavishly, especially during the first nine months in Paris, and through them she met Napoleon Bonaparte, and made friends with the Austrian painter Angelica Kauffman. She also met the French diplomat and politician Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, and the Irish republican Robert Emmet fleetingly. She recounted her meeting in Rome with the English aristocrat Frederick Augustus Hervey, and her audience with the Pope, Pius VII. Wilmot returned to London from Italy in October 1803, via Germany and Denmark, after England and France resumed hostilities.\n\nWilmot then went to Russia to bring home her sister Martha, and spent two years there. Martha was in the country as a favourite of Princess Dashkov, one of the key figures of the Russian Enlightenment and a close friend to Catherine the Great. Martha was living at the Princess's estate in Troitskoe (on the Oka River, about 100 km from Moscow). Katherine Wilmot arrived on 4 August 1805, having set out from Cork on 5 June. Wilmot's writings from this time record the Russian aristocracy's opulence and attitudes to the servile classes (the serfs). The sisters came to know the customs the Russian elite, as well as the festivals and religious rites of the country people. Wilmot left Moscow on 4 July 1807, a combination of passport problems, wars and storms at sea, resulted in delays and in her reaching Yarmouth on 7 September 1807, and returning to Ireland in October 1807.\n\nWilmot moved to France, Moulins, to live in a warmer, drier climate than Ireland. Her health declined when she moved to Paris, dying there 28 March 1824. Her nephew by Martha, Wilmot Henry Bradford, lived to be \"Father of the Army\".\n\n## Works\n\nWilmot had taken Martha's transcript of the memoirs of the Princess Dashkova when she left Russia. These were published by Martha in 1840, as she had burnt the original manuscript before her departure from Russia in 1808.\n\nWilmot's letters were published a century later, and have been described as a unique portrayal of the Napoleonic period. They describe the social scene, as well as the experience of travelling by coach and ship at that time. The family made transcriptions of the letters; the collection belonging to Martha were donated to the library of the Royal Irish Academy by Elisabeth van Dedem Lecky, the historian and writer. Amongst these Russian letters are a number written by Eleanor Cavanagh, who described the lives of servants. Wilmot's diaries were published in 1920 by Thomas Sadleir, and later by H. Montgomery Hyde and the Marchioness of Londonderry.\n\n* An Irish Peer on the Continent, 1801-03 (1920)\n\n* The Russian Journals of Martha and Catherine Wilmot (1934)\n\n* More letters from Martha Wilmot; Vienna 1819-29 (1935)\n\n* The Grand Tours of Katherine Wilmot, France 1801-1803, and Russia 1805-07 (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1992)\n\n## External links\n\n* Royal Irish Academy Wilmot Papers\n\n1770s births\n1824 deaths\nIrish expatriates in France\n19th-century Irish diarists\nPeople from Drogheda\n19th-century Irish women writers\n19th-century Irish travel writers\nIrish women travel writers\nIrish women diarists\nWriters from County Meath"}

{"id": "44819425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Pochonbo", "title": "Battle of Pochonbo", "text": "The was an event which occurred in northern Korea, Empire of Japan on 4 June 1937 (Juche 26), when Korean and Chinese guerrillas commanded by Kim Il Sung (or possibly Choe Hyon) attacked and defeated a Japanese detachment during the anti-Japanese armed struggle in Korea. The battle holds an important place in North Korea.\n\n## Battle\n\nAccording to the Korean Friendship Association, the battle was in retaliation to the brutality of the Japanese occupation of Korea at a time when \"the Japanese imperialists perpetrated unheard-of fascist tyranny against the Korean people\".\n\nAccording to the official North Korean version of the events, a small unit of about 150–200 guerrillas of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army's Sixth Division under Kim Il Sung crossed the Amnok River and arrived at the Konjang Hill on 3 June 1937. At 22:00, Kim Il Sung fired a shot into the sky, and the battle started. During the battle, the Japanese-occupied police station, post office, foresters' office, local elementary school, fire department hall were destroyed by the guerrillas. Kim took 4,000 yen from local people and inflicted damage estimated at 16,000 yen. He took the town but only occupied it for a few hours or a day before retreating to Manchuria.\n\nFollowing combat, Kim Il Sung made a speech, where he noted that the Korean people \"turn out as one in the sacred anti-Japanese war\". The battle is featured in Kim Il Sung's autobiography With the Century. In it, too, Kim describes his guerrilla troops acting spontaneously and motivated by emotion rather than reason and strategic insights. In it, he said of the event:\n\nThis official version of the battle does not correspond with some contemporary records such as a Japanese newspaper, however, which suggest that the rebels were actually led by Choe Hyon. But Kim Il Sung's absence from Japanese reports does not necessarily refute his presence in the battle, nor does the Choe Hyon's mention necessarily mean he was the top commander of the battle, as it only means Choe Hyon was the only commander on the Korean side whom the Japanese were able to identify.\n\n## Aftermath and legacy\n\n \nThe news of the battle was reported in numerous newspapers across the world, including the Soviet Union, China, Japan and France. According to the Association for the Study of Songun Politics UK, a pro-North Korean Juche study group:\n\nThe event brought Kim some fame among both his comrades as well as the Japanese. As a result, his influence grew, though the Japanese Imperial Army also started to hunt him, and almost wiped out his force. He was eventually forced retreat into the Soviet Union in 1940. Northern Korea was officially liberated from Japan on V-J Day (15 August 1945). Kim subsequently returned to his home country, and when he managed to establish himself with Soviet help as head of People's Committee of North Korea and Party's north faction (predecessors of future North Korea and WPK, respectively), his reputation as hero of Pochonbo helped him to gain acceptance and support among the people.\n\nSince then, the North Korean government has continuously reinforced the importance of the Battle of Pochonbo and Kim Il Sung's role in it. As result, it was speculated that Kim Jong Un, Kim Il Sung's grandson, had purged Choe Hyon's son Choe Ryong-hae in 2014 to prevent the undermining of the official version of the battle. It later became clear, however, that Choe Ryong-hae had not been purged at all and remained an influential member of the North Korean government.\n\nThe battle first entered the history textbook of South Korea in 2003, account Kim Il Sung's efforts on Anti-Japanese in relatively circumspect narratives. Controversies were raised on whether it makes students idolize North Korean regimes, or it could become a sign of South Korean history education stepping out from the cold-war thinking.\n\nThe Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble takes its name from the battle.\n\n## Battle site\n\nThe battle site is situated at Pochon County, Ryanggang Province at the Kusi Barrage on Kojang Hill.\n\n## Monument\n\nSamjiyon Grand Monument complex (area 100,000 m2) was completed in 1979 and includes a 15m-high statue of a Kim Il-sung, a huge square for rallies and many sculptures. This place was chosen as it is said to be where the guerrillas rested before the raid.\n\n## See also\n\n* Korean independence movement\n\n* Mt.

Until 2005 the team played as Hamburger SV Amateure.\n\nThe team has qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal, the German Cup, on five occasions. They currently play in the tier four Regionalliga Nord, in the fourth tier of the German football league system.\n\n## History\n\nThe team first played in the highest football league in Hamburg when it won promotion to the tier two Amateurliga Hamburg in 1955. The team was relegated from the league again in 1959 but returned in 1961. With the introduction of the Bundesliga in 1963 and the Regionalliga as the second tier below it the Amateurliga dropped to the third tier and was renamed to Landesliga Hamburg. HSV Amateure earned a runner-up finish in the league in 1964 but otherwise remained an undistinguished side in the Landesliga, eventually suffering another relegation in 1972.\n\nThe team returned to what had now become the Verbandsliga Hamburg in 1979, initially continuing its trend of mid-table finishes but improving from 1984 onwards. It won three league championships in 1986, 1987 and 1989 but failed to win promotion to the Oberliga Nord in the first two attempts, eventually succeeding in the third. The team played in the Oberliga from 1989 to 1994 as a mid-table side and qualified for the new Regionalliga Nord in 1994 when the league was established.\n\nThe team played in the Regionalliga until 2000 when a sixteenth-place finish forced it down to the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein for two seasons. A league title in the latter in 2002 allowed the club promotion back up to the Regionalliga Nord where it has been playing since, with a third-place finish in 2014–15 as its best result.\n\nThe team has also taken part in the DFB-Pokal on five occasions, courtesy to its Hamburger Pokal performance. On four occasions, in 1974–75, 1981–82, 1996–97 and 1997–98, the team was knocked out in the first round but in 1991–92 it advanced to the fourth round before losing 1–0 to Karlsruher SC.\n\n## Honours\n\nThe team's honours:\n\n* Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein\n\n* \n* Champions: 2002\n\n* Verbandsliga Hamburg\n\n* \n* Champions: (3) 1986, 1987, 1989\n\n* Hamburger Pokal\n\n* \n* Winners: (3) 1991, 1996, 1997\n\n## Recent seasons\n\nThe recent season-by-season performance of the club:\n\n* With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3.

Douglas Brinkley, Thompson's literary executor, told an interviewer that many of them are quite good, and that a collection is in the works.\n\n* Prince Jellyfish – Thompson's first novel, written in the early 1960s. A short excerpt was printed in Songs of the Doomed.\n\n* The Joint Chiefs or The Death of the American Dream – Thompson's letters from 1968 mention a book on the death of the American dream that was never published because he wasn't satisfied with the manuscript, calling it \"a pile of shit\".\n\n* Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: Extra Chapters – Two chapters written for the book were not included in the final text. One has the \"coconut smashing scene\" that was shown in the film adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Brinkley told an interviewer that he did not understand why the chapters were cut, as they are extremely funny and fit very well with the rest of the book. (Rolling Stone may have cut them because of space, but that doesn't explain why they weren't in the book.) He said he hopes they will be released in the near future.\n\n* The Gun Lobby – Brinkley describes the 250-page manuscript as \"Fear and Loathing at the NRA\". Thompson wrote the story for Esquire magazine, but the manuscript got shoved in a drawer for decades. Brinkley says he hopes to have it published soon.\n\n* The Night Manager – A non-fiction novel about Thompson's time at the O'Farrell Theater strip club in San Francisco. Originally an assignment to write about \"couples pornography\" for Playboy.\n\n* Polo Is My Life – Thompson described this novel as \"...a sex book — you know, sex, drugs and rock and roll. It's about the manager of a sex theater who's forced to leave and flee to the mountains. He falls in love and gets in even more trouble than he was in, in the sex theater in San Francisco\". It was slated to be released by Random House in 1999, and was even assigned , but was never published.\n\n## Sources\n\n* Joel Parham (2006).

{"id": "43002994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady%20Victoria%20Campbell", "title": "Lady Victoria Campbell", "text": "Lady Victoria Campbell (22 May 1854 – 6 July 1910) was a British philanthropist. She was born to two of the largest landowners in Scotland, being the third daughter of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll and his wife Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower. A childhood bout of poliomyelitis caused paralysis and required her to wear leg braces for the rest of her life.\n\nIn 1882, Lady Victoria experienced a \"second consecration\" and dedicated the rest of her life to helping those who lived on the islands throughout Argyll. She frequently visited the island of Tiree, where she championed social and religious organisations, and moved there in 1891. She also anonymously promoted the island, sending details of the plight of islanders in regular letters to the British press. In 1911 Victoria's sister Frances Balfour published a posthumous biography of her.\n\n## Family and early life\n\nLady Victoria Campbell was born at Carlton House, London on 22 May 1854, the third daughter and eighth child of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll by his first wife Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower. As such, the new baby was a member of the Campbell and Leveson-Gower families, two of the largest landowners in Scotland. She was named after Queen Victoria, the reigning monarch at the time of her birth. Her maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Sutherland, had been the Queen's friend and Mistress of the Robes. She was the only one of the twelve Campbell siblings who never married. Her relatives by marriage included Princess Louise, who was married to her eldest brother John.\n\nAt the age of five Lady Victoria contracted poliomyelitis, which caused paralysis and required her to wear leg braces for the remainder of her life. From 1859 to 1868, her health required her to spend most of the year in London and Brighton, near her orthopaedist Matthias Roth. Victoria was often separated from her immediate family during these periods, though she was looked after by her unmarried aunt Emily MacNeill and her lifelong servant and companion Elizabeth Knowles. Despite this separation, Victoria was particularly close to her sister Frances Balfour, who in 1868 described Victoria's bedroom as \"the centre of the fun and mischief that was going on in the family circle\".\n\nVictoria underwent multiple treatments and surgeries to alleviate the paralysis in her legs, and after physical therapy she was eventually able to use crutches and walking sticks. Her sister Frances later observed that because Victoria's ailments occurred from an early age, it became \"second nature\" to cope and she rarely spoke of them. In 1868, at the age of 14 Victoria developed a lung abscess which almost caused her death; she continued to have chest infections for the rest of her life. That same year, the Duchess had a stroke which led to ten years of being nursed by her third daughter. After the Duchess's death in 1878, the strain of the many years of nursing may have been the cause of Victoria's nervous breakdown in 1878–79. Victoria then oversaw the management of her father's households until his remarriage in 1881.\n\n## Philanthropy\n\nDespite her limited ability to walk, Victoria frequently visited poverty-stricken families on the island of Iona. During a visit to Iona Abbey in 1882, Victoria experienced a \"second consecration\" and thereafter dedicated herself to helping those who lived on the islands throughout Argyll. A plaque was later installed in the abbey that reads, \"In this church and by this window Victoria, daughter of George, eighth Duke of Argyll, dedicated her life to the glory of God in the service of the people of these islands.\"\n\nIn 1885 she began taking lessons in Gaelic, which was spoken on all of the islands; she sometimes taught Bible classes in the language. She also supported the creation of art and crafts that were inspired by Celtic culture, and participated in a resurgence of interest in Celtic Christianity in Argyll; the Celtic craft entrepreneurs Alexander and Euphemia Ritchie of Iona were two of her pupils.\n\n## Tiree\n\nLady Victoria first viewed the island of Tiree in 1878, when travelling on her father's yacht. In 1886, she learned of a dispute between her father and the residents of Tiree, who had suffered recent economic hardship. The islanders wished for a farm to be converted into crofts, but the duke instead leased it to someone else. Local citizens prevented the new tenant from taking up the farm, causing at least eight men to be arrested. The historian Joan B. Huffman describes this event as \"life-altering\" for Victoria, as she increased her visits to the island and later moved there in 1891.\n\nOn Tiree, Victoria championed social and religious organisations such as the YWCA, and organised soup kitchens. She also oversaw training for both men and women; the former learned crafts such as woodcarving while female residents were trained in needlework and lace-making. Lady Victoria promoted Tiree under the pseudonym 'Hebridean', sending details on the plight of islanders in regular letters to the British press. She was held in high esteem by residents, who admired her determination to reach the island even when bad weather made the journey dangerous.\n\nNear the end of her life, Victoria was instrumental in securing the construction of a new pier for Tiree. Travel to the island could be difficult and dangerous, as there was no adequate pier to gain access. Residents had repeatedly petitioned her father for help, only to be met with refusal; the duke decided he would not be the one to solely fund its construction, despite the danger travelling to Tiree meant for his daughter. A new pier was only built after his death; Victoria ultimately worked for twenty years to secure its construction, which occurred shortly after her death. She died on 6 July 1910 of influenza and pneumonia in Edinburgh, and was buried in Liberton Churchyard. In 1911 her sister Frances published a posthumous biography of Victoria.\n\n## References\n\nWorks cited\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n1854 births\n1910 deaths\nBritish philanthropists\nVictoria\nWomen of the Victorian era\nBritish royalty and nobility with disabilities\nDaughters of British dukes\n19th-century Scottish landowners\n19th-century Scottish businesspeople\n19th-century British women landowners\n19th-century Scottish businesswomen"}
{"id": "152108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebden%20Bridge", "title": "Hebden Bridge", "text": "Hebden Bridge is a market town in the Calderdale district of West Yorkshire, England. It is in the Upper Calder Valley, west of Halifax and 14 miles (21 km) north-east of Rochdale, at the confluence of the River Calder and the Hebden Water. The town is the largest settlement in the civil parish of Hebden Royd.\n\nIn 2015, the Calder ward, covering Hebden Bridge, Old Town, and part of Todmorden, had a population of 12,167. The town had a population of 4,500.\n\n## History\n\nThe original settlement was the hilltop village of Heptonstall. Hebden Bridge (Heptenbryge) started as a settlement where the Halifax to Burnley packhorse route dropped into the valley and crossed the River Hebden where the old bridge (from which it gets its name) stands. The name Hebden comes from the Anglo-Saxon Heopa Denu, 'Bramble (or possibly Wild Rose) Valley'.\n\nSteep hills with fast-flowing streams and access to major wool markets meant that Hebden Bridge was ideal for water-powered weaving mills and the town developed during the 19th and 20th centuries; it is said that at one time Hebden was known as \"Trouser Town\" because of the large amount of clothing manufacturing. Watercolour artist Thomas Frederick Worrall, who lived in nearby Pecket Well, depicted the mills in around 1900. Drainage of the marshland, which covered much of the Upper Calder Valley before the Industrial Revolution, enabled construction of the road which runs through the valley. Before it was built, travel was only possible via the ancient packhorse route which ran along the hilltop, dropping into the valleys wherever necessary. The wool trade was served by the Rochdale Canal (running from Sowerby Bridge to Manchester) and the Manchester & Leeds Railway (later the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway) (running from Leeds to Manchester and Burnley).\n\nHebden Bridge also grew to include a Picture House (seating 500), which remains open to present day, and offices for Hebden Bridge Urban District Council. Hebden Bridge has no swimming pool, although for some years there was a small training pool for children in the adult education centre on Pitt Street. Hebden Bridge had its own cooperative society but, during the 1960s, it was defrauded and went bankrupt. The old Co-op building became a hotel and was later converted into flats. The Co-op returned in the 1980s with a supermarket on Market Street, on the site of an old mill.\n\nDuring the Second World War Hebden Bridge was designated a \"reception area\" and took in evacuees from industrial cities.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s the town saw an influx of artists, writers, photographers, musicians, alternative practitioners, teachers, Green and New Age activists and more recently, wealthier 'yuppie' types . This in turn saw a boom in tourism to the area. During the 1990s Hebden Bridge became a commuter town, because of its proximity to major towns and cities both sides of the Pennines and its excellent rail links to Manchester, Bradford and Leeds.\n\nOn 6 July 2003, Hebden Bridge was granted Fairtrade Zone status. On 6 July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France, from York to Sheffield, passed through the town.\n\n## Governance\n\nHebden Bridge was a chapelry in the parish of Halifax. On 31 December 1894 Hebden Bridge became a civil parish formed from Wadsworth, Heptonstall, Erringden and Stansfield. On 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished to form Hebden Bridge. In 1931 the parish had a population of 6312.\n\nHebden Bridge Urban District was established in 1894. In 1937, the council merged with Mytholmroyd Urban District to become Hebden Royd Urban District. Hebden Bridge Urban District was administered as part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. These were abolished in the reforms introduced in the Local Government Act 1972. They were replaced by West Yorkshire, the metropolitan borough of Calderdale and Hebden Royd Town Parish. The town council is a parish council. Recently, it has attracted praise for its commitment to eco-friendly policies, following the example of Modbury in effectively banning all plastic shopping bags, thus becoming the largest community in Europe to do so. The ban is not legally enforceable, but rather a voluntary agreement between local shop owners and the community at large.\n\nHebden Bridge Town Hall and adjoining fire station is a Grade II listed building, built in 1898. The building was transferred from Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council to Hebden Bridge Community Association on a 40-year lease (now extended to 125 years) on 1 April 2010, along with funds for basic maintenance work. Substantial volunteer time was put into renovation works and fundraising to secure the building's future. The £3.7 million raised was used to create a small enterprise centre and new community facilities on land adjacent. More than 450 local people signed up as \"Friends of the Town Hall\" and became able to vote for the trustees.\n\n## Geography\n\nHebden Bridge lies close to the Pennine Way and Hardcastle Crags and is popular for outdoor pursuits such as walking, climbing and cycling. It lies on the Rochdale Canal – a through route across the Pennines.\nThe town is on the route of the Calderdale Way, a circular walk of about around the hills and valleys of Calderdale, and it is connected with the Pennine Way through the \"Hebden Bridge Loop\".\n\n## Flooding\n\nThe town's location in the valley causes problems with flooding particularly between Hebden Water and the cinema on New Road, Brearley Fields in Mytholmroyd, and further up the valley at Callis Bridge by the sewage works and the old Aquaspersions factory. Flooding at Callis Bridge is so frequent that the level of the River Calder has been lowered and special perforated kerbstones fitted so that water can drain back into the river. Brearley on a flood plain contains the playing fields for Calder High School and local football, rugby league and cricket teams. Hebden Bridge suffered two devastating floods in the summer of 2012, and again on Boxing Day 2015; Todmorden, Mytholmroyd, Sowerby Bridge and York were also affected, with houses, pubs, shops and community centres suffering damage to property. The extent of the Hebden Bridge flooding was shown in drone videos of the flooded areas, the most severe flooding occurring in Hebden Bridge town centre.\n\n## Demography\n\nHebden Bridge is a popular place to live. However, space is limited due to the steep valleys and lack of flat land. In the past, this led to \"upstairs-downstairs\" houses known as \"over and under dwellings\" (cf the back-to-back houses in nearby industrial cities). These were houses built in terraces with 4–5 storeys. The upper storeys face uphill while the lower ones face downhill with their back wall against the hillside. The bottom 2 storeys would be one house while the upper 2–3 storeys would be another. This also led to unusual legal arrangements such as the \"flying freehold\", where the shared floor/ceiling is wholly owned by the underdwelling.\n\nPopulation changes in the 1990s led to a demand for more houses. This has proved to be extremely controversial for a number of reasons. The limited availability of houses has meant that prices have risen sharply (for example, a house valued at £54,000 in 1998 was valued at nearly £150,000 in 2004). Demand for new houses is also a contentious issue as many of the sites for proposed development are areas such as fields or woodland that some local residents feel should be left as they are.\n\nHebden Bridge has attracted artists, and has developed a small New Age community. In the 1980s and 1990s, a prominent lesbian intentional community grew up in nearby Todmorden, and subsequently Hebden Bridge, \"promot[ing] forms of queer intimacy outside of the nuclear family unit\", with \"a close-knit community of care\" and mutual support, sharing childcare and community events, such as a \"famous Todmorden Women’s Disco\" held monthly. The nature of that community has changed with evolving queer politics, away from lesbian feminism and towards \"homonormative assimilation\". Hebden Bridge had the highest number of lesbians per head in the UK.\n\nIn April 2005, Hebden Bridge was named the fourth quirkiest place in the world by High Life (the British Airways flight magazine) and was described as \"modern and stylish in an unconventional and stylish way\".\n\nThe town was documented in the 2009 film Shed Your Tears And Walk Away, which made controversial claims about the levels of drug and alcohol abuse in the town, and consequent deaths among young people.\n\n## Economy\n\n, the weekly market has moved to Lees Yard adjoining the pedestrian centre of St George Square, and the market days have been increased from two and a half to four full weekly market days: Thursdays to Sundays.\n\nWalkley's Clog Mill is one of the country's leading clog manufacturers. It moved from its original home at Falling Royd to a site on Midgley Road in Mytholmroyd.\n\nAcre Mill was an asbestos factory in the hilltop settlement of Old Town, owned by Cape Insulation Ltd. It was opened in 1939 to meet the demand for gas mask filters made from blue asbestos during the Second World War, and diversified into the production of other asbestos products, including rope, pipe lagging and textile, after the war. In 1970, the company closed the mill and moved to Westmorland. The mill was the subject of a 1971 World in Action investigation entitled \"The Dust at Acre Mill\" which revealed how the factory broke the law regarding asbestos-dust control between 1940 and 1970. By 1979, 12% of a total of 2,200 former employees had asbestos-related disease. The mill was demolished in 1979. Cape Insulation also operated a second factory at Hangingroyd Mill.\n\nHebden Bridge has built a reputation for \"great little shops\" and has an unusually high density of independent shops for a UK town of its size with more than 20 cafes and tea rooms, and about 20 pubs, micro pubs and restaurants. In a national survey by the New Economics Foundation in 2010 Hebden Bridge was ranked sixth on a diversity scale and was praised for its independent shops and unique shopping experience. The Fox and Goose, West Yorkshire's first Co-Operative pub, is owned by 262 residents of Hebden Bridge. It was established in March 2014.\n\nIn February 2016, Hebden Bridge won as the \"Best Small Outdoor Market\" in the Great British Market Awards run by the National Association of British Market Authorities (NABMA). In December 2016, Hebden Bridge won the \"Great British High Street Award\" in the \"Small Market Town\" category, after most shops, cafes and businesses had bounced back better and more flood resilient than before the Boxing Day floods 2015; Hebden Bridge also won a second award as the People's Choice.\n\n## Culture\n\nHebden Bridge is known as \"the lesbian capital of the UK\".\n\nThe Stubbing Wharf is an 18th-century inn located alongside the Rochdale Canal, in which the poet Ted Hughes set his poem \"Stubbing Wharfe\". Hughes was born in neighbouring Mytholmroyd, and his former home Lumb Bank on the outskirts of Hebden Bridge is run as a creative writing centre by the Arvon Trust.\n\nThe video for the Talk Talk song \"My Foolish Friend\" was filmed in and around Hebden Bridge in 1983. The band The Dream Academy filmed the first video for their hit single \"Life in a Northern Town\" in Hebden Bridge in 1984. The singer Haddaway also filmed a music video in the town in 1995 for his single \"Lover Be Thy Name\".\n\nThe BBC One crime drama series Happy Valley, written by Huddersfield-born Sally Wainwright, broadcast in 2014-2023, was filmed and set in and around the town. Its ironic title refers to the drug users and providers in the area. Local landmarks, such as the graveyard at St Thomas the Apostle Church, the canal and the landscapes provided a backdrop to the narrative. The show received critical acclaim and was expected to lead to a noticeable increase in local tourism. A second series was filmed in 2015 and broadcast during 2016.\n\nIn 2020, Steve Coogan's \"From the Oasthouse\" podcast featured his character Alan Partridge stating that his daughter Denise lived in Hebden Bridge, which Partridge says explains her reluctance to have children.\n\n## Music\n\nThe Trades Club is a nationally recognised music venue and socialist members' club. In the 1980s and 90s, the club became a renowned World Music destination for touring bands from Africa and elsewhere, including Thomas Mapfumo, Ali Farka Touré, and John Chibadura. Heavenly Recordings have a close association with the Trades Club and celebrated their 25th birthday with 'A Heavenly Weekend In Hebden', a four-day festival at the Trades Club, featuring performances from many of the artists on their roster and film screenings from Heavenly Films. The event was given its own catalogue number: HVN300.\n\nUntil 2014, the town hosted the Hebden Bridge Blues Festival during the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. Established in 2011, the festival was voted the Best British Blues Festival in the 2012 and 2013 British Blues Awards.\n\nThe indie band Bogshed were formed in Hebden Bridge in 1984, originally as the 'Amazing Roy North Penis Band'.\n\nIn 2017, the Hebden Bridge Community Association received The Queen's Award for Voluntary Service, the MBE for voluntary groups.\n\n## Local media\n\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor and the local relay transmitters.\n\nThe town's local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds on 92.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 96.3 FM, Heart Yorkshire on 106.2 FM, Capital Yorkshire on 105.1 FM and Calder Valley Radio, a community radio station.\n\nThe Hebden Bridge Times is the town's local newspaper.\n\n## Transport\n\nHebden Bridge railway station lies on the Calder Valley Line between Manchester Victoria and Leeds City. It is served by frequent rail services to towns and cities in Lancashire, Greater Manchester, as well as West and North Yorkshire including Leeds, Blackpool North, York, Manchester Victoria and Todmorden. There are also some infrequent services to Dewsbury via Brighouse. The station is still in the original Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway colours, decorated with hanging baskets, original signage and luggage trolleys.\n\nBus services in the town are operated by three companies. First West Yorkshire operate the 12-minute frequency 592 service between Halifax and Todmorden, with services extending to Burnley (592) and Rochdale (590) in evenings and at weekends. Keighley Bus Company connect Hebden Bridge with Haworth, Oxenhope and Keighley with its hourly BrontëBus service. The \"Hebden Bridger\" is a local bus network operated by TLC Travel, that operates across seven services to local towns and hilltop villages. TLC Travel also operate the hourly 900 and 901 services between Hebden Bridge and Huddersfield.\n\nLeeds Bradford is the nearest airport, accessible by bus and train.\n\n## Notable people\n\n* Kirk Barker, actor, grew up in Hebden Bridge and was at school there.\n\n* Richard Bedford, Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter, lives in Hebden Bridge.\n\n* Lynn Breeze, illustrator and author of children's books, settled in and has written about Hebden Bridge.\n\n* Horatio Clare, author, known for travel, memoir, nature and children's books, lives in the town.\n\n* Edward Cronshaw, sculptor, began his career while living at Hebden Bridge.\n\n* Bernard Ingham, Chief Press Secretary to Margaret Thatcher, was educated at Hebden Bridge Grammar School.\n\n* Paula Lane, actor with roles including Kylie Platt of Coronation Street, remains a resident of the town and also runs a drama school there.\n\n* Amy Liptrot, author of The Outrun, lives in Hebden Bridge.\n\n* Alice Longstaff, photographer at Westerman's Studio from 1921 until 1992.\n\n* Benjamin Myers, author and journalist, is a resident.\n\n* Martin Parr, photographer, lived in Hebden Bridge, .\n\n* Jon Richardson, comedian, lived near Hebden Bridge with his wife Lucy Beaumont \n\n* Lindsay Jo Rimer, a 13-year-old girl from the town, went missing in 1994.

Unlike most other EF-mount lenses, it does not provide autofocus.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe TS-E 135 mm 4L MACRO provides four degrees of freedom, allowing ±10° tilt with respect to the film or sensor plane and ±12 mm shift with respect to the center of the image area; each movement can be rotated ±90° about the lens axis.\n\nShifting allows adjusting the position of the subject in the image area without moving the camera back; it is often used to avoid convergence of parallel lines, such as when photographing a tall building.\n\nTilting the lens relies on the Scheimpflug principle to rotate the plane of focus away from parallel to the image plane; this can be used either to have all parts of an inclined subject sharply rendered, or to restrict sharpness to a small part of a scene. Tilting the lens results in a wedge-shaped depth of field that may be a better fit to some scenes than the depth of field between two parallel planes that results without tilt.\n\nUnlike most view cameras, the shift mechanism allows shifts along only one axis, and the tilt mechanism allows tilts about only one axis; however, the rotation of the mechanisms allows the orientations of the axes to be changed, providing, in effect, combined tilt and swing, and combined rise/fall and lateral shift.\n\nThe TS-E 135 mm 4L MACRO was the first lens from Canon which combined Macro and tilt-shift. It was announced together with a series of lenses, the TS-E 50 mm 2.8L MACRO and the TS-E 90 mm f/2.8L MACRO, which introduced the same features.\n\n## See also\n\n* TS-E 17 mm\n\n* TS-E 24 mm\n\n* TS-E 45 mm\n\n* TS-E 50 mm\n\n* TS-E 90 mm\n\n## External links\n\n* Canon stellt spiegellose 24-MP-Systemkamera EOS M100 und neue Profi-Objektive der L-Serie vor\n\nCanon L-Series lenses\nCanon EF lenses\nPerspective-control lenses\nCamera lenses introduced in 2017\nMacro lenses"}

The episodes aired as the twentieth and twenty-first episodes of the eighth season of the American legal drama television series JAG, and the 178th and the 179th episodes overall. Both episodes were written by Donald P. Bellisario and Don McGill. \"Ice Queen\" was directed by Bellisario and originally aired on CBS on April 22, 2003, while \"Meltdown\" was directed by Scott Brazil and originally aired one week later, on April 29, 2003.\n\nMark Harmon, Michael Weatherly, Robyn Lively, Pauley Perrette, Alan Dale, Zoe McLellan, Faran Tahir, and David McCallum guest-starred in both episodes as Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Anthony DiNozzo, Vivian Blackadder, Abby Sciuto, Thomas Morrow, Jennifer Coates, Amad Bin Atwa, and Donald Mallard, respectively. Harmon, Weatherly, Perrette, Dale, and McCallum all went on to play the same characters in NCIS. Alicia Coppola, who guest-starred in \"Meltdown\" as Faith Coleman, also reprised her role in NCIS.\n\n\"Ice Queen\" follows the NCIS team, led by Special Agent Gibbs, as they investigate the murder of Lieutenant Loren Singer and ultimately arrest Commander Harmon Rabb as their prime suspect. \"Meltdown\" shows Rabb's trial and the continued investigation by the NCIS team to find the real culprit. The subplot for both episodes involves the NCIS also working to prevent terrorist attacks. \"Ice Queen\" was watched live by 13.8 million viewers, while \"Meltdown\" was watched by 13.6 million viewers.\n\n## \"Ice Queen\"\n\nWhile chasing after a stray arrow into the forest, a young Boy Scout finds the arrow has landed in a corpse. NCIS agents Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Vivian Blackadder, and Anthony DiNozzo arrive on the scene and meet up with NCIS Medical Examiner Dr. Donald Mallard who informs them that the corpse is that of a pregnant Navy Lieutenant. DiNozzo determine she is a JAG, while Gibbs determines that she washed up from the nearby river.\n\nAt the JAG headquarters, Admiral A. J. Chegwidden informs his team that the NCIS has found the body of a Navy Lieutenant, who is believed to be five months pregnant. The team is unable to get in contact with Lieutenant Loren Singer, who is almost nine months pregnant, so they are told that the NCIS plans to use DNA to confirm if the body is Singer's. Commander Harmon Rabb leaves the room causing Chegwidden to wonder aloud if there is something going on between Rabb and Singer.\n\nNCIS Director Thomas Morrow and his team go to the MTAC, where they watch as other NCIS agents successfully capture Amad Bin Atwa. Meanwhile, Dr. Mallard determines that the body is Singer's and was dumped in the river at the top of the falls after being hit with a metal object.\n\nAt JAG headquarters, Chegwidden tells his team what the NCIS has found. Chegwidden privately asks Rabb how he is involved with the murder and thinks that Rabb might know who the father of Singer's baby is. Gibbs and Blackadder question everyone except for Rabb, who calls his half-brother Sergei Zhukov to tell him about Singer's death.\n\nDiNozzo finds Singer's car and determines which bridge Singer was thrown off of and gives the evidence he collected to Forensic Scientist Abby Sciuto, who finds Rabb's fingerprint in the car. Dr. Mallard determines that Singer has been dead for three months, Sciuto learns that she called Zhukov before she died, and Special Agent Don Dobbs finds a Navy Commander's hat near the crime scene. After looking up Zhukov's file, they learn about Zhukov and Rabb being brothers. Gibbs interrogates and arrests Rabb, as he believes that Zhukov is the father of Singer's baby and that Rabb killed Singer to cover for his half-brother.\n\n## \"Meltdown\"\n\nRabb meets with Lieutenant Commander Faith Coleman, who has been assigned as his legal counsel, while Gibbs meets with Major Jack McBurney, who will be arguing against Rabb. Morrow tells Gibbs that he needs him to interrogate Bin Atwa as soon as possible. Sciuto, Dr. Mallard, and Gibbs all testify and Gibbs admits that he no longer believes Rabb killed Singer.\n\nGibbs, Coleman, and McBurney meet with Sciuto, who tells them that the hat Dobbs found belongs to Rabb. Gibbs interrogates Bin Atwa and uses information Blackadder received from the FBI to get him to reveal information about the location of terrorist Hussan Mohammed. Meanwhile, Abby determines that the hat was planted at the scene recently.\n\nWith Gibbs busy on the Bin Atwa case, DiNozzo and Blackadder continue the case without him and learn that Singer regularly met with a man for dinner. Using information from restaurant employees and the JAG security logs, they determine that the man was Commander Ted Lindsey, who Rabb recalls stole his hat. While DiNozzo interrogates him, Lindsey claims that it was an accident and Singer fell off the bridge, but DiNozzo tells him that Singer was thrown off the bridge.\n\nDiNozzo and Blackadder meet up with Gibbs and tell him that Lindsey admitted to everything. They then go with Gibbs to capture Mohammed. They are successful, but Mohammed saw Blackadder and nearly killed Gibbs with a grenade.\n\n## Development\n\nIn January 2003, it was announced that a JAG spin-off centering on the Naval Criminal Investigative Service was in development. It was also revealed that the spin-off would be introduced in an episode of JAG and would contain a new cast. JAG creator Donald P. Bellisario had been considering a series about the Naval Criminal Investigative Service for a few years before pitching it to the CBS Television president at the time, Les Moonves, in 2002. Bellisario pitched the series to Moonves as \"JAG meets CSI\" with a gruff NCIS agent and his squad. In May 2003, CBS picked up NCIS, which premiered with \"Yankee White\" in September 2003.\n\n## Casting\n\nIn March 2003, Mark Harmon was cast in the lead role as Leroy Jethro Gibbs. Bellisario was initially hesitant about the casting, but changed his mind after seeing Harmon as Secret Service Agent Simon Donovan on The West Wing. Later that month, Michael Weatherly was cast as Anthony DiNozzo. Pauley Perrette and David McCallum were later cast as Abby Sciuto and Donald Mallard, respectively. Robyn Lively was cast as Vivian Blackadder the day before the episodes began filming. Lively was not retained when NCIS premiered due to the producers feeling that she was too soft for the type of role and would be replaced by Sasha Alexander, who played a new character, Caitlin Todd. \"Meltdown\" also introduced two new JAG characters.\n\n## Viewing figures\n\n\"Ice Queen\" was watched live in the United States by 13.8 million viewers, making it the third most watched show of the night in terms of number of viewers. It was the third most watched show of the night in terms of 18–49 rating, with a 9.3, and in terms of ratings share, with a 15. It was behind American Idol and Judging Amy in all three categories. \"Meltdown\" was watched live in the United States by 13.6 million viewers, making it the second most watched show of the night in terms of number of viewers, behind only American Idol. It was the third most watched show of the night in terms of 18–49 rating, with a 9.1, and in terms of ratings share, with a 14, behind American Idol and Judging Amy in both categories.\n\n## Critical response\n\nGreg Braxton of the Los Angeles Times said \"The episodes ... are lighter in tone, sprinkled with black humor and a grisly quality that recalls CSI.\"\n\n## References\n\n2003 American television episodes\nJAG (TV series) episodes\nNCIS (TV series)\nTelevision pilots within series"}

His ancestor, Jules-Alexandre-Benjamin Senard, was given the title of Count by the Pope. In his childhood, he was a cellist. He studied at the École nationale d'administration.\n\nSenard began his career in foreign affairs in 1947. He covered Europe and NATO while in the press service. He worked for the Secretary General of Foreign Affairs from 1967 to 1969. He was chief of protocol under Georges Pompidou from 1969 to 1972. During her visit to France in 1972, Queen Elizabeth II was received by Senard at her provincial residence, Château de Lagoy near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. He then served as Ambassador to the Netherlands.\n\nOn 13 September 1974 in The Hague, Senard was one of ten people held hostage by Carlos the Jackal. He was held hostage for five days, including sixty hours without eating or drinking. Senard remained ambassador until 28 July 1976.\n\nSenard was subsequently appointed Ambassador of France to Egypt, serving from 1976 to 1979, then serving as Inspector General of Foreign Affairs from 1979 to 1981. On 17 February 1981, he was appointed Ambassador of France to Italy. However, his time at Palazzo Farnese was brief due to his appointment as diplomatic advisor to the government of France on 4 November 1981.

It was founded as a co-operative in 1862, and, in 2007, joined the small number of UK co-operative retailers to demutualise.\n\nIn the years immediately prior to demutualising, M&F Co-op ran a funeral business, a food shop and department store in Musselburgh, and also invested in commercial property, including shops and a leisure complex at Fisherrow harbour. It converted into a private company limited by shares called M & F (Scotland) Limited.\n\n## Demutualisation\n\nM&F Co-op made headlines as one of a very few retail members of the British co-operative movement to demutualise.\n\n## 2005 demutualisation attempt\n\nA 2005 attempt by M&F Co-op to demutualise was halted by a Court of Session interdict, and resulted in an investigation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the regulator for Industrial and Provident Societies such as M&F Co-op.\nThe petition for interdict, which was made by eight members opposing demutualisation, including former president George Cunningham, alleged 19 governance irregularities, including conflicts of interest and an inquorate board of directors, as three of the six directors had resigned in preceding weeks.\nThe FSA investigation reported in 2006 that M&F Co-op's democratic governance had not been functioning effectively.\n\n## 2007 demutualization\n\nThe board called a further members meeting for June 2007 to vote on a demutualization resolution. \nIn September 2007, the M&F Co-op incorporated a private limited company, M & F (Scotland) Limited, and transferred its assets and obligations to it, deregistering as an Industrial and Provident Society on 1 October 2007.\n\nCo-operative News reported that M&F Co-op had technically demutualised and was no longer eligible for membership of Co-operatives UK, due to its articles granting voting rights on the proportion of shares owned rather than the fundamental co-operative principle of one member one vote.\n\n## Operations\n\nM&F Co-op operated a food store and a non-food department store in Musselburgh High Street, a commercial property business, and funeral services in Musselburgh and Dalkeith.\nIn January 2006, M&F Co-op had net assets of £6,745,943.\n\nIt built and operated the Quayside restaurant and leisure complex overlooking Fisherrow harbour, which opened in 1992.\nIt sold it in 2007 to leisure entrepreneur Charan Gill, who refurbished it and renamed it The Quay.\nThe commercial property business also leased shops.\n\n## Co-operative movement\n\nIn 2007, it was the smallest retail consumer co-operative in Scotland, by number of shops. \nAlong with the much larger Scotmid, Lothian Borders & Angus, and The Co-operative Group, the movement had five such co-operatives in Scotland. \nM&F Co-op and Clydebank Co-operative Society were the only two that had not merged into a regional or national co-operative by that time.\n\nIn 1993, M&F Co-op's president George Cunningham, (who petitioned the Court of Session for the 2005 interdict that delayed demutualization,) was president of the Co-operative Congress, considered the highest honour in the British co-operative movement.\n\nThe Co-operative Group owns and operates a pharmacy in Musselburgh High Street, and an Alldays convenience store in Clayknowes Road, that are not affiliated with M&F Co-op.\n\n## External links\n\n* \n\nConsumers' co-operatives of the United Kingdom\nCompanies based in East Lothian\nFuneral-related companies of the United Kingdom\nDemutualized organizations\nFormer co-operatives of the United Kingdom\nMusselburgh\n1862 establishments in Scotland\nOrganizations established in 1862\nRetail companies established in 1862\nCo-operatives in Scotland"}

She has done work researching the influence of media on childhood development and psychological well-being, and focuses on the relationship between childhood use of video games and violent behavior.\n\nOlson completed her undergraduate degree in communications and earned master's degree in community health education from the University of Minnesota in 1986. She then earned a Doctor of Science degree in Health and Social Behavior at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1995, as well as a Postdoctoral European Certificate in Pharmaceutical Medicine from the University of Basel. Olson served as a faculty member of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School for 15 years and as an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. She also co-founded the Center for Mental Health and Media at Massachusetts General Hospital with Lawrence Kutner, PhD in 2000.

Utilizing surveys and focus groups to collect data from teenage gamers and their parents, the study was the largest of its kind. Olson and Kutner suggest that the findings of this research project provide evidence against several stereotypes related to video gamers, including lack of social aptitude and physical activity, and also highlight parents' lack of awareness in their teenagers' gaming practices and factors that increase children's exposure to violent video games.\n\nIn addition to video game use, Olson and Kutner investigated the relationship between violent video games and violent behavior. Citing the findings of their research project, they conclude that violent video games are not inherently bad; instead, a multitude of factors related to both the game and the gamer may impact the potential outcome of video game use. Olson also argues that while video games rated for mature audiences are associated with a higher likelihood of violent behavior such as fighting, the relationship between violence video games and violent behavior may not be one of cause and effect and that the research sheds light on potential benefits of video game use, including development of problem-solving and strategic planning.\n\n## Smoking cessation and prevention\n\nOlson has consulted on smoking cessation and prevention initiatives and conducted research on strategies to combat smoking using a behavioral approach.

Smith", "text": "Fred Eliphaz Smith (March 29, 1873 – September 29, 1918) was a United States Army officer and a posthumous recipient of the U.S. military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor. He was born in Rockford, Illinois, and graduated from the University of North Dakota in the spring of 1894. He first joined the national guard in 1898, later transferring to the regular army in 1899.\n\nHe was promoted to major due a lack of capable officers when the US joined World War I. On September 29, 1918, near Binarville, France, Smith showed conspicuous leadership until being mortally wounded. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor four years later, on November 25, 1922. Smith died at the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\n## Military service\n\nSmith joined the North Dakota National Guard in April 1898 and was assigned to Company D, which drilled in Devils Lake, North Dakota. On May 16, 1898, the Guard promoted him to regimental sergeant major and on June 21, transferred him to Company K in Dickinson, North Dakota. With the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, the eight North Dakota National Guard units were formed into the 1st Infantry Regiment and sent to Manila Bay in the Philippines in July 1898. On February 6, 1899, the U.S. Senate approved the terms of the peace treaty, ending the war with Spain. However, the fighting was not over. Rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo led an insurrection movement against the American forces. Smith was summoned to Manila and notified that the next day he would be given an exam prepared by West Point instructors to determine if he would qualify to be an officer in the Regular Army. He aced the test and was commissioned a second lieutenant on February 24. On July 26, 1899, Smith was transferred to the 36th U.S. Volunteers. After the Americans defeated Aguinaldo, Smith returned to the United States. During his stateside service, he rose to the rank of captain in the U.S. Army.\n\nAfter the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917, it needed qualified officers. The army noticed Smith's leadership ability and promoted him to major on August 3, 1917, then to lieutenant colonel on August 29. He was assigned to the 15th Infantry and sailed to England on April 25, 1918. Smith arrived in France on May 14, was transferred to the 77th Division on July 12, and went to the front lines on July 17.\n\nOn September 29, 1918, near Binarville, France, Smith showed conspicuous leadership until being mortally wounded. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor four years later, on November 25, 1922.\n\n## Medal of Honor Citation\n\nRank and organization: Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army, 308th Infantry, 77th Division. Place and date: At Binarville, France; September 29, 1918. Entered service at: Bartlett, North Dakota. Born: March 29, 1873; Rockford, Illinois. General Orders: War Department, General Orders No. 49, November 25, 1922.\n\nCitation:\n\nWhen communication from the forward regimental post of command to the battalion leading the advance had been interrupted temporarily by the infiltration of small parties of the enemy armed with machineguns, Lieutenant Colonel Smith personally led a party of two other officers and ten soldiers, and went forward to reestablish runner posts and carry ammunition to the front line. The guide became confused and the party strayed to the left flank beyond the outposts of supporting troops, suddenly coming under fire from a group of enemy machineguns only 50 yards away. Shouting to the other members of his party to take cover this officer, in disregard of his danger, drew his pistol and opened fire on the German gun crew. About this time he fell, severely wounded in the side, but regaining his footing, he continued to fire on the enemy until most of the men in his party were out of danger. Refusing first-aid treatment he then made his way in plain view of the enemy to a hand grenade dump and returned under continued heavy machinegun fire for the purpose of making another attack on the enemy emplacements. As he was attempting to ascertain the exact location of the nearest nest, he again fell, mortally wounded.\n\n## Military Awards\n\nSmith's military decorations and awards include:\n\n## See also\n\n* List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War I\n\n## References\n\n1873 births\n1918 deaths\nAmerican military personnel killed in World War I\nBurials at Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery\nPeople from Rockford, Illinois\nUnited States Army colonels\nUnited States Army Medal of Honor recipients\nWorld War I recipients of the Medal of Honor\nUnited States Army personnel of World War I\nMilitary personnel from Illinois"}

It is located three miles north west of Haddington, and one mile south of Aberlady.\n\n## History\n\nThe castle was built in 1507 when King James IV ordered his private secretary James Murray to build himself a fortified house at Ballencrieff. It was destroyed in or around 1545.\n\nFrom around 1550 to 1580 the house was owned (and presumably rebuilt) by David Borthwick, Lord Lochill who renamed it Lochill Castle. In 1608 the Ballencrieff estate was bought by Bernard Lindsay of Lochhill, owner of the King's Wark, and then to Sir Patrick Murray in 1632, In 1679 it passed to Sir Peter Wedderburn. \n\nGeneral James Murray, a Governor of Canada, was baptised in Aberlady, and is said to have been born at Ballencrieff, in 1721. If so this suggests that his father Alexander, 4th Lord Elibank, George's father, was then resident there. The house burnt down accidentally in 1868, and a small garden cottage was built using the stone from the castle. The cottage still currently stands within the grounds of the walled garden. The castle stood roofless until it was restored between 1992 and 1997. It is now privately owned, and it is situated next to a free range rare breed pig farm.\n\nThe long, rectangular-plan, tower has three storeys, including a vaulted basement, with a near-symmetrical north front. The tall, narrow south-east wing has crow-step gables. The castle, along with its walled garden and pavilion, is a category B listed building. During restoration works, 16th-century gun holes and wooden draw-bars on the windows, were discovered in the ruins. The remains of two early 17th-century moulded plaster ceilings with the initials and heraldry of Gideon Murray, and the remnants of an elaborate fireplace, were found on the first floor.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of places in East Lothian\n\n* List of places in Scotland\n\n## External links\n\n* Nigel Tranter Albavision Video of Ballencrieff Castle restoration\n\n* Geograph photo of Ballencrieff Castle\n\n* Pre-restoration view of Ballencrieff Castle\n\nCastles in East Lothian\nCategory B listed buildings in East Lothian\nListed castles in Scotland\nTower houses in Scotland"}

The company is based in Herrenberg, Germany.\n\n## History\n\nKlaus Ulbrich founded the company in 1996, in Herrenberg, in Baden-Württemberg, near Stuttgart, after a career in other industries. He studied mechanical engineering at the Ingenierschule fur Feinwerktechnik Furtwangen (engineering school for precision engineering) in Furtwagen, Germany, now Hochschule Furtwangen University. This school included watch and clock engineering as a specialty study. The school also houses an internationally known watch and clock museum that is devoted to the history of timekeeping devices.\n\nThe brand made its first appearance at Baselworld in 1998 with three models: CM03, CG103, and CGK203.\n\n## Design\n\nMr. Ulbrich wanted to base his designs on schools of wabi-sabi, the Japanese art of finding beauty in imperfection and modesty, and Bauhaus, the German school of design founded in 1919, which sought to blend the distinction between the fine arts and applied arts.\n\nThis philosophy resulted in six design principles that are applied to Temption timepieces:\n\n* Simplicity\n\n* Less is more\n\n* Form follows function\n\n* Simple dials, easy to read, ergonomic, and the date window is always the color of the dial\n\n* High contrast between the hands and the dial\n\n* Hidden logo, to not spoil the ergonomics of the dial.\n\nTemption has traditionally used Swiss ETA movements as the basis for the movements in their watches, but now offers some models with Soprod movements. Several Temption model come with inlaid cabochons on the crown and the chronograph pushbuttons.\n\n## Models\n\nDue to the size of the company and the fact that Herr Ulbrich designs all of the watches himself, there is little changeover in the models, but many models are limited productions, so some new models are variants of previous models. Production is approximately 700 watches per year. The list of models below is current as of 2020.\n\n* CM01 (introduced in 2013): Minimalist 43mm design with date window and cyclops magnifier ground into the underside of the sapphire crystal rather than attached to the top surface.\n\n* CM03 (introduced in 1997): 42mm GMT (independent second hour hand) watch with date display window and rotating bezel.\n\n* CM05 (introduced in 2010): Minimalist 42mm watch with date display window and rotating bezel.\n\n* CAMEO (released in 2008): Square dial, unique curved case watch with date display; its water resistance rating of 10 atm is higher than other square dial watches. The original model was limited to 500 pieces and came in brown with brown amber cabochon in the crown. The CAMEO S has a silver dial and black leather strap. The Cameo S was nominated for Watch of the Year award organized by the German watch magazine Armbanduhren and news magazine Welt am Sonntag in 2020, and was watch of the month in the April 2020 issue of Armbanduhren.\n\n* CGK204: 43mm chronograph with day and date windows; month, moon phase, and 24-hour dial indications.\n\n* CGK204 CURARE: CGK204 with black PVD finish and yellow accents.\n\n* CGK205: 43mm GMT (independent second hour hand) chronograph, noted for its legibility, with day and date windows; month, moon phase, and 24-hour dial indications; and onyx cabochon insets.\n\n* CLASSIC: 43mm chronograph with day and date display windows and onyx cabochon insets.\n\n* CALLA: Unisex 35mm model with date window.\n\n## Former models\n\n* CM02: Intermediate (38mm) GMT with date window.\n\n* CM06: Standard 3-hand watch with week, day, and power reserve subdials.\n\n* CORA (listed on website, but out of production): Ladies 29mm watch with world's smallest chronograph movement, available in rose gold or stainless steel with optional diamond bezel and sharkskin strap. Stainless models were limited production of 300 pieces; gold, 75 pieces.\n\n* CURIE'': Intermediate (38mm) GMT with date display.\n CG103: 42mm chronograph with day and date displays.\n CGK203: 42mm chronograph with day and month displays, date, moon phase and 24-hour sub-dials, limited production of 1100 pieces.\n FORMULA: Chronograph with day and date displays.\n\nIn addition to watches, Temption also offers two rings designed by Mr. Ulbrich (stainless steel rings with an inset stone): CORUS (emerald, ruby or sapphire) and CESAR''' (onyx).\n\n## See also\n\n* List of German watch manufacturers\n\n## External links\n\n* Official Website\n\n## References\n\nWatch brands\nWatch manufacturing companies of Germany\nCompanies based in Baden-Württemberg\nManufacturing companies established in 1996\n1996 establishments in Germany\nPrivately held companies of Germany\nGerman brands"}

Friederich \"Fred\" Wollbrinck and Johannah (Hannah) Kottmeier had both come from Herford, in Westphalia. Louis Wollbrinck left school at twelve to become an errand boy for Woodward and Tiernan printing, then pressman, and stayed 5 years. He then worked as feeder and pressman for the Great Western Show Printing Co. until he was 24. Turning to real estate and building, he was the youngest builder in St. Louis, with 65 houses going up at once. The Historic American Buildings Survey documented the north side of the 4900 block of Page Avenue in 1986, when it was still covered in the moderately sized, modestly ornamented homes Wollbrinck built for a rising merchant-class. (images have been released to the public domain).\n\nWollbrinck was nearly bankrupted in a downturn of the housing market, but under the name \"Central Amusement Company\" he ran \"Old St. Louis\" and another concession at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, after which he became a clerk in the Assessor's office (until 1908, when he was shuffled out in a change of administration). He returned to real estate, organized Everybody's Amusement Company and ran an open-air theater at the corner of Taylor and Delmar. He was a staunch Republican, and though he lost the 1918 election for City Assessor (the Progressives split the bloc and gave the office to Democrat Frank Schramm) St. Louis Mayor Henry Kiel took advantage of a provision of the new city charter to fire Schramm and appoint Wollbrinck. There followed a legal struggle and a nine-months suit before the Missouri Supreme Court. During his tenure, he instituted the state’s income tax, upheld in the often-cited Ludlow-Saylor Wire Co vs. Wollbrinck case. On February 13, 1923, he was granted U.S. patent #1444822, for improvements in the design of the spark plug.\n\nWollbrinck married Louise Gelser of St. Louis, December 5, 1906; their children were Louis, Edward G., Lanita (m. Clements), Vida (m. Voss) and Ferda (died in childhood). Louis Wollbrinck died of arteriosclerosis at the age of 61 on June 24, 1928, and was interred at Valhalla Cemetery, St. Louis.\n\n## Notes\n\n1867 births\n1928 deaths\nBusinesspeople from St. Louis\n20th-century American inventors\nMissouri Republicans"}

{"id": "17402159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprock%20Chief", "title": "Caprock Chief", "text": "The Caprock Chief or Caprock Xpress was a proposed Amtrak inter-city rail service which would run from Fort Worth, Texas, to Denver, Colorado, passing through the Texas Panhandle, which currently does not have passenger rail service of any kind. Initially proposed 2000–2001, the project has not yet seen significant progress and is unlikely to be implemented. \"Caprock\" is a geological term for a harder or more resistant rock type overlying a weaker or less resistant rock type, and lends its name to the Caprock Escarpment that defines the edge of the high plains of the Llano Estacado.\n\n## Route\n\nThe train would run west from Fort Worth across northern Texas, then turn north to run through the Texas Panhandle and the western edge of Oklahoma before entering Colorado. It would serve the following communities:\n\n* Texas: Fort Worth, Weatherford, Eastland, Abilene, Sweetwater, Lubbock, Plainview, Amarillo\n\n* Oklahoma: Boise City\n\n* Colorado: La Junta, Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Littleton, and Denver\n\nBoth Fort Worth and Denver are served by long-distance trains (the Texas Eagle and California Zephyr, respectively), but there has not been single-train service between the two cities since the Texas Zephyr ended in 1967. , any such trip would require changing trains in Illinois or California, a detour of over a thousand miles.\n\nFort Worth is also served by the Heartland Flyer, which connects it to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, while La Junta is a stop on the transcontinental Southwest Chief. None of the other proposed station stops have train service. In the past there have been proposals to re-route the existing Sunset Limited (Los Angeles—Orlando) farther north to serve the Fort Worth—Sweetwater segment.\n\n## Development\n\nThe impetus for the route came from the Texas Association of Rail Passengers (TARP), which lobbied local governments to support the concept. In late 2001 a visit by Amtrak officials to Lubbock produced discussion, but no commitment from the corporation.\n\nIn early 2002 the Amarillo City Commission voted unanimously in favor of \"a resolution supporting proposed Amtrak rail service expansion to provide a direct route through the Panhandle of Texas from Fort Worth, Texas to Denver, Colorado via the Caprock Chief line.\" The Lubbock chamber of commerce also voiced its support for the route, with 92% of its members in favor. Commenting on the proposal, representative Mac Thornberry warned that \"Having Amtrak service through the Panhandle would be a good thing for our region...but it won't be easy. Our nation's rail infrastructure faces some serious challenges, and Amtrak is already heavily subsidized by the taxpayers. Any new routes will have to improve Amtrak's financial situation, rather than make it worse.\"\n\nBy 2004 the president of the TARP acknowledged that the proposal was dead: \"It's probably years off before this can be considered...We figure you've got to start talking about it at some point. It has to be an idea and you have to develop that idea.\" The proposal reemerged in 2013–2014, when Amtrak contemplated re-routing the Southwest Chief via Amarillo. TARP officials expected that the change could make Amarillo a hub for train services. The Caprock Chief, with termini in Denver and Fort Worth, would allow passengers to transfer at Amarillo to increase ridership of the Southwest Chief.\n\n## See also\n\n* Ports to Plains Corridor\n\n* Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway\n\n## External links\n\n* Texas Association of Rail Passengers\n\nPassenger rail transportation in Texas\nTransportation in Lubbock, Texas\nProposed Amtrak routes"}

The woman sacrifices herself and allows the little girl to run away as they are surrounded. The woman is bitten and killed by the grotesque monsters.\n\nLt. Colonel Sawyer is driving through the aftermath of the outbreak, he happens upon a Sheriff and his two deputies who explain that he must turn back as the road ahead is infested with zombie's. He reluctantly agrees and shows he is a peaceful man. Hours later he finds another deputy who sympathises with his desire to go into the danger zone and allows him to breach the barricade.\n\nMeanwhile, another survivor, Stephanie is shown scavenging for food, she is about to enter a grocery store when a male survivor happens upon her and warns her the store is riddled with the undead and it is unsafe. She is mute and does not understand at first but the stranger offers her food and shelter back at his safe with his sister and daughter. On the way back the stranger tells Stephanie his mother will cook her food and Stephanie becomes concerned. She politely declines his invitation and he attacks her and attempts to rape her. Stephanie escapes when a zombie attacks and devours her attacker.\n\nStephanie flees to a building site to rest but zombies gather and she is forced up a crane for safety. Sawyer happens upon her and saves her and he promises to help her. Although Stephanie is reluctant to trust him.\n\nLater Sawyer and Stephanie meet a kindly survivor named Wilson who explains that the zombies are becoming weaker as they starve and he believes a damn nearby may be a safe place. Sawyer promises to see them safely to the dam but he confesses his mission is to scatter the ashes of his wife and daughter who were killed, in the ocean as he had promised to take them before the outbreak.

Sawyer and Wilson save her and they head to the dam.\n\nWhen Sawyer reaches the ocean he scatters his families ashes and contemplates suicide, holding a gun to his temple. He is distracted when he hears screams for help.\n\nHe finds Stephanie and Wilson helplessly watching a group of women and children being attacked by zombie's, the group help them and one woman explains that the damn is unsafe and the children as orphans. Sawyer then finds one of the children is his daughter Rosette. They reunite and the survivors take refuge in an office building.\n\nWilson and one of the survivors, Victoria, become friendly but she reveals to him they do not want to be around a soldier, believing the military caused the outbreak after a video broadcast by the vice president claimed the virus was purposefully released to control the population. Sawyer overhears and promises he had no idea and offers to clear out the infested dam to prove his loyalty to the group.\n\nSawyer enters the dam and dispatches the horde of zombies making it safe for the survivors.\n\nIn the end he finally takes his daughter to see the ocean and they both seem happy.\n\n## Cast\n\n* Robert Tweten as Lt.

Joel and Elle were portrayed as runaways and troublemakers who put in no effort on the show, and they were generally disliked by the public.\n\n## Judges' Scores\n\n Colour key:\n Highest Score\n Lowest Score\n\n## Auction\n\nThe Auctions were held on Saturday November 5, 2022, with the episode being aired the following night. Omar & Oz broke the record for the highest amount of profit ever made in a Block auction, taking home a total profit of $1,686,666.66, which equates to $843,333 each. Meanwhile, the other auctions did not fare so well. High interest rates and inflation lead to the lowest result since 2011, with favourites Tom & Sarah-Jane taking home just $20,000.99. Rachel & Ryan passed in their home and it sold immediately after for $4,249,000.50, netting them a profit of $169,000.50. Ankur & Sharon and Dylan & Jenny followed Rachel & Ryan’s strategy by passing in their homes in hope for a better result down the track. On 11 November, Ankur & Sharon‘s house sold for $4.25 million giving them a profit of $170,000. On 13 February, Dylan and Jenny’s house was sold for an undisclosed amount more than 3 months after auction. In May 2023, it was revealed their house had sold for $3.9 million, $180,000 under reserve, meaning they did not make any profit.\n\n## Ratings\n\nNotes\n\n## Death\n\nOne of the workers, Jon-Jeremy Bradey, died in October 2022.

{"id": "18973583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento%20Mountain%20Lions", "title": "Sacramento Mountain Lions", "text": "The Sacramento Mountain Lions was a professional American football team based in Sacramento, California that played in the United Football League. The franchise originated as the California Redwoods, and played its home games in San Francisco and San Jose before relocating to Hornet Stadium in Sacramento in 2010, then to Raley Field in West Sacramento in 2012. The team was coached by Dennis Green for three of its four years of existence. Amid financial problems, the UFL folded in the middle of the 2012 season.\n\n## California Redwoods (2009)\n\nThe team began play as the California Redwoods in October 2009. (Early trademark filings had suggested the UFL would name the team the \"San Francisco Rockfish,\" a name that was dumped before any public announcement.) In the league's 2009 season, the Redwoods played were originally slated to play all of its home games at AT&T Park in San Francisco, including the first-ever UFL game. Due to a conflict with the San Francisco Giants, the UFL's first game was instead played in Las Vegas. Poor attendance in San Francisco led to the league relocating one of the Redwoods' home games to Spartan Stadium in San Jose.\n\nFormer NFL head coach Dennis Green was hired as the Redwoods' head coach prior to the season. He led the team to a 2–4 record in its first season, finishing in third place.\n\n## 2010 season\n\nLeague commissioner Michael Huyghue announced shortly after the end of the 2009 regular season that the team would \"likely\" move permanently to San Jose for the 2010 season. On March 3, 2010, the league declared that the team would permanently relocate instead to Hornet Stadium in Sacramento, California for 2010, as part of a deal with Sacramento State University that saw the UFL provide a new artificial turf for the facility.\n\nDespite the \"California Redwoods\" name still being valid (as the team remained the only UFL team in the state), league officials also announced that the California Redwoods branding would be abandoned. A new name was decided through a fan vote, though the name \"Redwoods\" remained a possible choice. On April 6, 2010, the league announced that the franchise would be known as the Sacramento Mountain Lions.\n\nAdditionally, head coach Dennis Green added the title of general manager following the season; he replaced league-wide general manager Rick Mueller, who handled the duties in 2009.\n\nOn September 25, the team won their first game in Sacramento, 24-20, becoming the first team to defeat the Florida Tuskers in the regular season, in front of a reported crowd of over 20,000.\n\n## 2012 season\n\nHead coach Dennis Green left the team after the 2011 season amid dispute and legal action; he was replaced by Turk Schonert. The team also left Hornet Stadium, its home stadium of 2010 and 2011, without attempting to negotiate a lease renewal. Instead, the team signed a deal with Raley Field, a predominantly baseball-oriented park built for the Sacramento River Cats of the Pacific Coast League, for the team's four 2012 home games.\n\nThe UFL's financial woes, a new venue, less prominent coach, and continued on-field shortcomings hurt the Mountain Lions' attendance figures in 2012, although not nearly to the same extent as the other three UFL markets. Reports of players and staff not getting paid, as well as the 2011 season getting cut short, tested the devotion of fans, as many considered the UFL a dead product. The UFL abruptly halted the season again after four games and pledged to continue its season in 2013, a promise that never came to fruition because of lawsuits against the league.\n\n## Records vs. teams\n\nThis includes postseason games.\n\n## External links\n\n* Official webpage\n\n \n2010 establishments in California\n2012 disestablishments in California\nAmerican football teams established in 2010\nAmerican football teams disestablished in 2012"}

When Patriarch Joachim I of Constantinople was deposed in 1502, the rulers of Wallachia, quite influential on the affairs of the Church of Constantinople, sponsored the election of the old Nephon II of Constantinople, who refused. Thus they transferred their support to Pachomius I, who was elected in early 1503. His first reign lasted only about one year, because in early 1504 Joachim I returned to the throne after a payment of 3500 gold pieces to the Sultan.\n\nJoachim I died shortly later during a travel in Wallachia and so in autumn 1504 Pachomius I, always supported by the rulers of Wallachia, returned to the throne. The second reign of Pachomius lasted about nine years, a long period in comparison with the reigns of the patriarchs in the 15th century.\n\nThe main issue during Pachomius I's patriarchate was the case of the Cretan scholar Arsenius Apostolius. In 1506 the Roman Curia appointed Arsenius as Byzantine Rite bishop of Monemvasia, at that time part of the Stato da Màr of the Republic of Venice. Arsenius declared himself in communion both with the Patriarch of Constantinople and with the Catholic Church. This position was untenable for the Church of Constantinople and Pachomius I invited Arsenius to abdicate. The issue went on for more than two years until June 1509 when Pachomius I excommunicated Arsenius, who retired to Venice.\n\nDuring the last year of his patriarchate, Pachomius I visited Wallachia and Moldavia. On the way back, already in Selymbria, Pachomius I was poisoned by Theodolus, a monk at his service. Pachomius I died immediately, in early 1513.\n\n## External links\n\n* Historia politica et patriarchica Constantinopoleos, Cap XV: Patriarch Pachomius, (trans.

{"id": "65482931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teesside%20oil%20terminal", "title": "Teesside oil terminal", "text": "The Teesside oil terminal is a major crude oil reception, processing, storage and export facility at Seal Sands, Middlesbrough. It receives and processes crude oil delivered by the subsea NORPIPE pipeline from the Norwegian Ekofisk field and the UK Fulmar and J-Block fields. The terminal includes facilities for exporting stabilised crude oil and liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) by tanker and pipeline.\n\n## History\n\nThe Ekofisk field was commissioned in 1970 with gas from the field exported to Emden Germany and oil loaded into tankers offshore. In 1975 the 354-km Norpipe subsea pipeline was commissioned to transport oil from Ekofisk to Seal Sands Teesside UK. The Teesside oil terminal (54°37'05\"N 1°10'37\"W) was designed to treat this oil to a specification suitable for atmospheric storage and tanker transportation.  It was also designed to process the associated natural gas liquids (NGL). A connection to Norpipe in the UK sector of the North Sea allowed UK fields to export oil to Teesside as they were commissioned. These included the Fulmar installation commissioned in 1982, and the Judy installation, commissioned in 1997.\n\nThe 285-acre (115 ha) Teesside site was selected for the deep water moorings available. The oil terminal was officially opened on 21 October 1975. Three days later the first tanker departed Teesside with a cargo of stabilised Ekofisk oil treated at the Teesside terminal. Initially the plant was unable to process natural gas liquids. The NGL plant was commissioned in March 1979. The terminal also provided feedstock to the nearby Shell UK Ltd Teessport Refinery.\n\n## The plant\n\nThe plant at the Teesside terminal includes the following:\n\n* Crude oil reception and storage facilities – including pig receiver, isolation valves and 4 oil storage spheres\n\n* Six parallel oil stabilisation trains – comprising crude washing, heating, degassing, cooling and pumping\n\n* Natural gas liquids (NGL) processing plant – this fractionates NGL into purified gas and liquid products, the plant includes distillation, compression and storage facilities\n\n* Product export plant – including pumping, metering, export pipelines, jetties and tanker loading plant\n\n* Vapour recovery facilities – including volatile organic compounds (VOC) carbon bed absorption \n\n* Effluent treatment – including ballast water and plant effluent, treatment includes plate separators and dissolved air flotation. Effluent is sent to the Bran Sands sewage treatment works for final biological treatment\n\n* Utilities – including power generation, steam raising, firewater, instrument air and inert gas\n\n* Flare system – for disposal of unwanted gases\n\n## Operations\n\nThe specification of oil arriving at Teesside from the Norpipe pipeline is typically:\n\nThe Teesside terminal was originally designed to process 1 million barrels/day of live crude oil. It currently (2020) receives 800,000 barrels/day (127,186 m3/d) of oil and processes up to 67,000 barrels/day (10,652 m3/d) of NGL.\n\nThe specification of the plant is to produce stabilised crude with a Reid vapour pressure of 3 to 8 psig (20.7 – 55 kPa).\n\n## Stabilisation\n\nThere are six parallel stabilizer columns, the heat to drive the separation process is by reboilers at the base of each column. Each reboiler has a thermal capacity of 40 MW. In the base of the stabilisers the temperature is sufficient to drive off lighter hydrocarbons as vapour. These rise through the column, stripping lights ends out of the down-coming oil. The light ends are withdrawn from the top of the stabilisers where they are compressed and routed to the NGL plant. Stabilized crude is drawn off the base of the stabilisers and is cooled and routed to storage tanks. There are 9 stabilised oil tanks each with a capacity 750,000 barrels (119,237 m3).\n\n## NGL processing\n\nThe gases from the top section of the stabilisers are routed to the NGL plant. The plant also receives (since 1998) NGL recovered in the adjacent CATS gas terminal. The plant is capable of processing 64,000 barrels/day (10,175 m3/d). It comprises a series of fractionation vessels: de-methaniser, de-ethaniser, de-propaniser, de-butaniser and butane splitter. The vessels operate at successively lower pressures and higher temperatures. The vapour from the top of each vessel is respectively methane, ethane, propane, butane and iso-butane. Propane is used as a refrigeration medium in the plant. There are three propane compressors each driven by a 3.1 MW gas turbine. The flue gases from the gas turbines are routed to the combustion chambers of the steam boilers. There are three steam boilers of 104 MW capacity which provide steam for the stabiliser plant reboilers. Methane is used as fuel gas on the plant. Ethane, propane and butane are liquefied and sent to insulated storage tanks prior to loading onto ships.\n\n## Export\n\nWhen required oil is pumped from the tanks to the quays and loaded aboard tankers. The terminal has four quays for crude oil export. One of these quays can be used for NGL products. There are also four quays for liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) loading. The crude oil quays are each capable of handling tankers of up to 150,000 deadweight tonnes, the LPG quays can handle carriers of up to 60,000 m3. Each of the jetties is provided with a vapour collection and recovery system. There are two vapour recovery units capable of processing 16,000 m3/h of hydrocarbon rich vapour, comprising vacuum pumps, guard beds and absorber columns. In addition to sea transport stabilised crude can also exported by pipeline to the Greatham tank farm.\n\n## Owners\n\nThe Teesside oil terminal was owned and operated by Phillips Petroleum Company from 1975 to 2002.\n\nOwnership transferred to ConocoPhillips when Phillips and Conoco Inc. merged in 2002.\n\nBy 2018 the terminal was still operated by ConocoPhillips. It was owned by:\n\n* ConocoPhillips Petroleum Company U.K. Ltd. 40.25%\n\n* Total Holdings Europe S.A.S 45.22%\n\n* ENI S.p.A. 14.20%\n\n* Minority shareholder 0.33%\n\n## See also\n\n* North Sea Oil\n\n* Oil terminal\n\n* Norpipe\n\n* Flotta oil terminal\n\n* Sullom Voe Terminal\n\n* Oil terminals in the United Kingdom\n\n* List of oil and gas fields in the North Sea\n\n## References\n\nPetroleum infrastructure in the United Kingdom\nPetroleum industry in the United Kingdom\nOil terminals"}

It was founded in the reign of Henry II, when Torphin, son of Robert, son of Copsus, assigned the manor and advowson of Ravenstonedale to Watton Priory in Yorkshire. It was supposed to house a master and three canons.\n\n## The Gilbertine Community\n\nThere are few historical references to the life of the community. We do know there was a dispute over lands with Bishop Robert Chause of Carlisle (1258–78) which confirms the Priory was still in the possession of Watton in the late 13th century, and in 1336 the appropriation of Ravenstonedale church by the Priory confirms Watton’s possession at that later date. \nAlso, in 1405 an enquiry was held into the maintenance of the house, when it was claimed that for some time the canons had not been in residence.\n\n## Post-dissolution\n\nAt the dissolution of Watton priory in 1539, Ravenstonedale priory passed to the archbishop of York, and then to the Wharton family. \nFollowing the sequestration of the Wharton estate in 1729, the lands were bought by the Lowther family. \nThe ruins were first written about in 1677 by George Fothergill, and shortly afterwards by Machell in 1681, who described the cloister court. The ruins were then not substantial and by the time that Bishop Nicholson wrote about them in 1703, they had largely disappeared. Nicholson noted that a vault was visible which had been used as a prison for those on capital offences at the manorial court.\n\n## Excavations\n\nThe priory ruins were excavated by E P Frankland in 1928-29, who recognised it as being the Gilbertine cell. The size of the layout appeared large in comparison to the conjectured size of the Gilbertine community in its later years. This excavation uncovered both the present visible ruins, and a range of foundations to the north of these, which are now re-covered.\n\nIn 1988-89 an extensive excavation was undertaken by Cumbria County Council on behalf of Ravenstonedale Parochial Church Council, using funds raised locally and a grant from English Heritage. Following this, consolidation work was undertaken, and the present visible ruins are the east range of the cloister probably dating from a re-modelling of existing buildings in the late 13th to 14th centuries.\n\nThere is an interpretation plaque on the site.\n\n## References\n\n* Monastic remains at Ravenstonedale.

He was among the first European physicians to perform a dissection on a human being (1341), a practice that had long been taboo in Roman times. Gentile wrote several widely copied and read texts and commentaries, notably his massive commentary covering all five books of the Canon of Medicine by the 11th-century Persian polymath Avicenna, the comprehensive encyclopedia that, in Latin translation, was fundamental to medieval medicine. Long after his death, Gentile da Foligno was remembered in the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493) as Subtilissimus rimator verborum Avicenne, \"that most subtle investigator of Avicenna's teachings\"\n\nOther works by Gentile were De complexione, proportione et dosi medicinarum; Consilium de temporibus partus; De statu hominum; De lepra; De febribus; De balneis; De divisione librorum Galeni; Tractatus de reductione medicinarum; Regimen preservativum; Among these the Consilium, a compilation of therapeutic advice for many diseases. He made commentaries on two works, Carmina de urinarum iudiciis (\"Songs of urinary judgements\") part of a metrical work, the Carmina medica, that had been composed by Egidius Corbaliensis, and Egidius' De pulsibus (\"About pulses\").\nA mark of the respect in which Gentile's work continued to be held, more than a century after his death, was the rapidity with which they appeared in print, from the Italian presses, beginning in the 1470s. \n\nGentile's commentary de urinarum iudiciis makes a first attempt to comprehend the physiology of urine formation; aided by his dissection of cadavers, Gentile asserted that urine associated with the blood passes per poros euritides (\"through the porous tubules\") of the kidney and is then delivered to the bladder. Commenting on De pulsibus, he connected the relationship between fast pulse rate and urine output and correlated the color of urine with the condition of the heart. For the originality of his thought Mario Timio suggested that Gentile could be indicated as the 'first' cardionephrologist in the history of medicine.\n\nHe prepared a widely read treatise on the Black Death, recommending theriac among other prophylaxis, but died of the plague himself.\n\n## Notes\n\nHistory of anatomy\nAcademic staff of the University of Perugia\nAcademic staff of the University of Siena\n1348 deaths\nYear of birth unknown\nUniversity of Bologna alumni\n14th-century deaths from plague (disease)\n14th-century Italian physicians\n14th-century Italian writers\n14th-century writers in Latin"}

All matches took place in one of 25 venues chosen to be played in that season. The format for the group stage was a double round-robin. That meant all teams would face each other at least twice. The teams needed to qualify in the top 2 of their respective groups to qualify for the play-offs. The Thunderbolts finished 2nd in their group, while the Fire finished 1st. The Thunderbolts won 11 and lost 4 games, while the Fire won 9 and lost 4, with one game washed out. In the play-offs, the Thunderbolts defeated the Dallas Mustangs 2–0 in a 3-match-series to advance to the semi-finals, where they defeated the Silicon Valley Strikers by 6 runs to advance to the finals. The Fire defeated the Manhattan Yorkers 1–0 in a 3-match-series to advance to the semi-finals, where they defeated the New Jersey Stallions by 96 runs to advance to the finals.\n\n## Match\n\nThe final match was played between the Seattle Thunderbolts and the Atlanta Fire at Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Seattle Thunderbolts won the toss and elected to bowl. Corné Dry dismissed opening batter Rayyan Pathan for a duck on the third ball of the match to bring in captain Harmeet Singh. Singh accelerated the innings, hitting Steven Taylor for four fours, before being dismissed for 20 by Nasir Hossain. This brought in Shubham Ranjane to the crease with Andries Gous. Gous and Ranjane stretched together a 57-run partnership before Gous was caught out by Evroy Dyer off Taylor. Taylor then proceeded to take the wicket of Rishi Bhardwaj for 7. Ranjane then brought up fifty as Shadley van Schalkwyk launched Dry and Taylor for a flurry of boundaries. Ranjane eventually was dismissed for 51 by Taylor in the final over, with Schalkwyk and Prajith Mudi taking the Thunderbolts to 157/5 after 20.\n\nOpeners Steven Taylor and Zain Sayed got the Fire off to a good start, with Taylor smacking Schalkwyk and Bodugum for 3 fours, before being dismissed by Bodugum for 14. This brought in Aaron Jones to the crease by Sayed, who stitched a run-a-ball 58-run partnership, before season MVP Phani Simhadri dismissed Sayed for 26. Ranjane then came in to bowl, and immediately took the wicket of Nasir Hossain for 7, and Jahmar Hamilton for 4. Dry stuck around with Jones, with Jones bringing up his half-century, before departing for 64 off Ranjane. Ranjane then took the wicket of Amila Aponso the very next ball. Evroy Dyer was then dismissed by Simhadri for 6, and very next ball, Dry for 14. Jay Pathak was then run out in the final over for 3, as the Thunderbolts defeated the Fire by 10 runs to win the 2022 Minor League Cricket season.\n\n## Scorecard\n\nNotes:\n\n* indicates team captain\n\n* * indicates not out\n\nToss: Seattle Thunderbolts won the toss and elected to bat.\n\n|colspan=\"4\"|Extras (lb 2, w 2)Total 157/5 (20 overs)\n|14\n|6\n|7.85 RR\n\nFall of wickets: 0/1 (Rayyan Pathan, 0.3 ov), 49/2 (Harmeet Singh, 5.4 ov), 106/3 (Andries Gous, 15.1 ov), 114/4 (Rishi Bhardwaj, 15.5 ov), 149/5 (Shubham Ranjane, 19.4 ov)\n\nTarget: 158 runs from 20 overs at 7.85 RR\n\n|colspan=\"4\"|Extras (lb 1, w 3, nb 1)Total 147/9 (20 overs)\n|8\n|4\n|7.35 RRFall of wickets:' 1/15 (Steven Taylor, 1.2 ov), 73/2 (Zain Sayed, 10.2 ov), 84/3 (Nasir Hossain, 12.3 ov), 96/4 (Jahmar Hamilton, 14.5 ov), 132/5 (Aaron Jones, 17.4 ov), 132/6 (Amila Aponso), 140/7 (Evroy Dyer, 18.5 ov), 140/8 (Corné Dry, 18.6 ov), 143/9 (Jay Pathak, 19.2 ov)\n\n## References\n\nMinor League Cricket\n2022 in American cricket"}
{"id": "23722369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda%20Martell", "title": "Linda Martell", "text": "Linda Martell (born Thelma Bynem; June 4, 1941) is an American singer. She became the first commercially successful black female artist in the country music field and the first to play the Grand Ole Opry. As one of the first African-American country performers, Martell helped influence the careers of future Nashville artists of color.\n\nBorn and raised in South Carolina, Martell listened to country, gospel and R&B music. In her teens, she formed a singing trio with her family titled Linda Martell and the Anglos. During the 1960s, the group recorded a handful of R&B singles and sang alongside other black performers. However, the group had little success and soon parted ways. Performing as a solo act, Martell was discovered singing country music on an air force base. This led to an introduction to producer Shelby Singleton, who signed her to his Nashville label in 1969. The same year, the label released her country cover of \"Color Him Father\". The song became a top 25 single on the Billboard charts and her debut album followed in 1970.\n\nMartell made several appearances on country music television programs and released two more singles with Plantation. She also made her first appearance on the Grand Ole Opry during this time. She later performed there 12 times. Following a series of business conflicts with her manager (Duke Raymer) and producer, Martell left her recording contract. She then retired from the country music industry in 1974 following a lack of success. Over the next several decades, she lived in various states and continued performing music. To make a living, she worked in public education and returned to South Carolina in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2021, the CMT Music Awards honored Martell with the Equal Play Award. In March 2024, Martell was featured on two tracks of Beyoncé's eighth studio album Cowboy Carter, including \"Spaghettii\", which generated her first Grammy Awards nomination.\n\n## Early years\n\nThelma Bynem was born June 4, 1941 as one of five children born to Clarence and Willie May Bynem in Leesville, South Carolina. Her father was a sharecropper while her mother worked many hours at a chicken slaughterhouse. To avoid helping with sharecropping duties, Martell learned to make dinners for her family when she was seven years old. Her father was also a preacher, which inspired her earliest music. She sang gospel music at church and was also drawn to country music. Clarence Bynem regularly listened to the country music of Hank Williams on WLAC, based out of Nashville, Tennessee. \"Until we got into our teens we knew country music and that was it,\" she told the Courier-Post in 1998. Martell, her sister and cousin then formed a singing trio, which they called The Anglos. The group performed R&B music and sang in areas around Columbia, South Carolina. Local DJ, Charles \"Big Saul\" Greene convinced her to change her name from Thelma Bynem to Linda Martell. \"Your name is Linda Martell. You look like Linda. That fits you,\" Greene told her.\n\n## 1962–1969: R&B beginnings and musical shift\n\nIn 1962, The Anglos took an eight-hour bus ride to Muscle Shoals, Alabama where they recorded their first R&B single. Re-named Linda Martell and the Anglos, Fire Records released \"A Little Tear (Was Falling from My Eyes)\" the same year. The single was unsuccessful. The group performed regularly. They also sang backup vocals for R&B performers, such as The Drifters and Jimmy Hughes. Linda Martell and the Anglos (sometimes credited as \"The Angelos\") released several more singles on the Vee-Jay label, such as \"Lonely Hours\". David Browne of Rolling Stone called the song \"simmering, forlorn girl-group pop\". The group parted ways after her cousin got married. Her sister left the group soon after and Martell was a solo act for the first time in her career. For several years, she continued singing R&B music.\n\nWhile singing on a South Carolina air force base, Martell was heard singing country songs by Nashville furniture salesman William \"Duke\" Rayner. He offered to arrange for a demo record to be made, but Martell originally declined his offers thinking he was a \"kook\". However, after much encouragement, Martell accepted his proposal and Rayner became her manager. With the recent country music success of Charley Pride, Rayner believed Martell could be accepted within the same industry. \"I figured that if I could find a colored girl that could sing country and western, I'd really have something,\" he told Ebony in 1970. She then flew to Nashville where she met producer Shelby Singleton. With Rayner present as well, Martell recorded a demo record. She also met with Singleton who convinced her to record as a country singer. Martell was surprised at the decision. \"I was a little bit shocked! I was mostly doing pop. But he said, 'You gotta go country',\" she told Rolling Stone in 2020.\n\n## 1969–1974: Country music success\n\nOn May 15, 1969, Martell signed a management contract with Rayner and signed with Singleton's Plantation record label the next day. The Plantation nameplate (whose name derived from slave plantations in the American South) was disliked by Martell. However, she felt she had no choice but to go along with it. Soon after her signing, Singleton found material for Martell to record for the label. Among the first records he found was \"Color Him Father\", a then-recent pop song by The Winstons. She recorded the song (and ten other tracks) in one 12-hour work session. The song was issued as Martell's first Plantation single in July 1969. It climbed to number 22 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Its follow-up was Martell's interpretation of \"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\", which was later covered by Freddy Fender. Martell's version reached number 33 on the Billboard country chart in 1970.\nIn August 1970, her debut album was released on Plantation Records titled Color Me Country. The record reached number 40 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. The album was reviewed favorably by Billboard in 1970, which found her country singing style to be authentic. In later years, AllMusic rated the record three and a half stars with similar commentary. Her final charting single was issued around the same time titled \"Bad Case of the Blues\".\n\nWith her new success, Martell was hired by booking agent, Hubert Long, who helped arrange several entertainment opportunities. She soon made television appearances on The Bill Anderson Show and Hee Haw in 1970. She also made her debut on the Grand Ole Opry radio broadcast after Rayner played her recent record for an official at the company. With her Opry debut, she became the first black female artist to play the show and eventually performed there a total of 12 times. In the American south, she was marketed as the \"First Female Negro Country Artist\" and was put on package shows with country artists Waylon Jennings and Hank Snow. Martell later recalled that performing as a black country artist was often challenging. She remembered being taunted by white audiences, who often shouted racial slurs while she was performing. \"You're gonna run into hecklers, and I did...You felt pretty awful,\" she told Rolling Stone.\n\nAs Martell's country music career progressed \"the taunting lessened but never entirely went away\", according to Rolling Stone. The name-calling continued to cause her professional conflict, but Martell continued performing nonetheless. She also ran into other professional conflicts. In May 1970, Rayner sued her because he believed he deserved a higher commission. Singleton helped bring attention away from the lawsuit. Singleton also informed Martell that he would not be promoting her as heavily because he found that label-peer Jeannie C. Riley was selling more records. Martell then left her contract with Plantation and cut several tunes for a different label. Singleton found out and threatened to sue the company. \"He blackballed me...It ruined my reputation in country music,\" she recalled in 2020. After several more years of limited success, Martell ultimately chose to retire from the Nashville music industry.\n\n## 1975–present: Other music opportunities and career switch\n\nAfter leaving Nashville, Martell remained active in other sectors of music. For about two decades, she sang in small clubs in different parts of the United States. This included California, Florida and New York City. In these different places, Martell held various jobs, including entertaining on a cruise ship and opening a record shop. In 1991, she returned to South Carolina to be closer to her children. To make a better living, she became a bus driver for her home region's school district. She also continued to perform in a band on weekends where they entertained functions such as family reunions, weddings and fraternity celebrations. While many residents of her local area were not aware of her former success, co-workers at her school building did. In one high school assembly, a principal spoke of her earlier work: \"Others study about black history. We have black history right here in our own school.\"\n\nIn the mid 2000s, Martell retired from her public school career and last performed publicly in 2011 with her band, Eazzy. In January 2014, the Swedish TV program entitled Jills veranda – Nashville (translated as Jill's Porch – Nashville) documented the search for and interview of Martell. The show's hosts traveled to South Carolina to meet Martell, discuss her music and why she abandoned her recording career. The hosts also performed with Martell on some of her songs. She became a topic of conversation in 2020 after country artist Rissi Palmer named her Apple Music podcast after Martell's 1970 album, Color Me Country. She also supports the underrepresented voices of BIPOC artists in country music through the Color Me Country™ Artist Grant Fund.\n In 2021, a GoFundMe campaign was launched by Martell's granddaughter to create a documentary about her career and struggles as a black performer in Nashville.\n\nIn 2024, Martell appeared on Beyoncé's country-focused eighth studio album Cowboy Carter. She made two spoken-word appearances on the tracks \"Spaghettii\" and \"The Linda Martell Show\". On Instagram, Martell commented, \"I am proud that @beyonce is exploring her country music roots. What she is doing is beautiful, and I’m honored to be a part of it. It’s Beyoncé, after all!\" At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards \"Spaghettii\" received a nomination for Best Melodic Rap Performance, becoming Martell's first nomination at the ceremony.\n\n## Artistry and influence\n\nMartell's musical artistry combined elements of country, gospel, and R&B music. Writers at Ebony magazine characterized her voice as having \"gutsy, emotional soul\", while also having a \"background that is rich in gospel and rhythm and blues\". Martell herself drew similar connections when discussing the way she approached recording \"Color Him Father\" in the studio. Writer David Browne commented that she delivered the song in a performance that was \"a little bit country and a little bit R&B.\" When discussing her country style, Martell explained the storytelling aspect of the genre: \"Country music tells a story...When you choose a song and you can feel it, that's what made me feel great about what I was singing. I did a lot of country songs, and I loved every one of them. Because they just tell a story.\" Katie Moulton of the Oxford American also highlighted Martell's country intonation in an article. Moulton also compared her musical delivery to that of torch singers like Dusty Springfield and Dinah Washington.\n\nMartell was among country music's first black artists to have commercial success. Her career in country music helped inspire careers of other black artists in the industry, including Kane Brown and Mickey Guyton. In 2020, Guyton recalled searching on the internet for \"black women country singers\" and was surprised to find Martell's music. \"I didn't even know she existed...I felt really bad when I discovered that I didn’t know,\" she recounted. Brown reflected similarly: \"Color was a thing back then. It's still a thing today, but it was worse back then. She was so brave.\" Fellow black country artist Rissi Palmer commented to NPR that by creating her 2020 podcast she was \"paying homage to the foundation on which my house is built, and that is Linda Martell.\"\n\nMartell was honored with the Equal Play Award at the 2021 CMT Music Awards. It was given to recognize her work as a female black performer in country music. A tribute during the broadcast was given by Darius Rucker, Carrie Underwood, Rissi Palmer, Rhiannon Giddens, Jennifer Nettles and Mickey Guyton.\n\n## Personal life\n\nMartell has been married twice. At age 19, she first wed drummer Clark Thompson. The couple had three children. In 1966, the pair separated and she later remarried business owner, Ted Jacobs. Jacobs also brought one child from his first marriage and the family lived in Nashville while Martell was signed to Plantation Records. She discussed her domestic life with Ebony magazine in 1970, explaining the challenges associated with being a traveling performer while also being a wife and mother. \"I'm used to spending time with my family,\" she recalled.\n\nAfter leaving the country industry, Jacobs and Martell separated. Jacobs' business partner and Martell then started a romantic relationship. Together, the couple traveled and lived in several states before Martell returned to South Carolina. In 2004, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent radiation treatment. Making a full recovery, she later moved in with one of her children in South Carolina.\n\n## External links\n\n* Linda Martell profile at The Forty Five\n\n1941 births\nAfrican-American country musicians\nAmerican country singer-songwriters\nAmerican women country singers\nAmerican rhythm and blues singers\nCountry musicians from South Carolina\nFire Records artists\nLiving people\nPeople from Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina\nVee-Jay Records artists\n20th-century African-American women singers\n20th-century American women singers\n20th-century American singers\nSinger-songwriters from South Carolina"}

He managed in nearly 400 games in the Football League with Everton from 1889 to 1901 and later managed Brentford.\n\n## Everton\n\nMolyneux joined Everton in 1878, when the club was founded as St. Domingo FC. He became Everton secretary-manager on 23 August 1889. His Toffees team finished as runners-up in the Football League in the 1889–90 season and won the Liverpool Senior Cup. Everton went one better in the 1890–91 season, winning the Football League and retaining the Liverpool Senior Cup. In 1892, Molyneux was one of the instigators behind the club's move across Stanley Park from Anfield to Goodison Park. Despite dominating the Liverpool Senior Cup throughout the 1890s, Everton failed to win any further major silverware during Molyneux's tenure and finished as runners-up in the Football League First Division in 1894–95 and were FA Cup finalists in 1892–93 and 1896–97. Everton also twice won the Lancashire Senior Cup under Molyneux, in 1894 and 1897. Molyneux's tenure came to an end on 11 September 1901, when he was suspended by the board of directors for suspected drunkenness.\n\n## Brentford\n\nMolyneux became manager of Southern League First Division club Brentford in 1903. Later in the year, Molyneux was suspended from football until the end of the 1903–04 season for attempting to buy goalkeeper John Bishop out of the Scots Guards. Molyneux managed the club to mid-table mediocrity in the following two seasons, with the club's best position being 9th in 1905–06. During Molyneux's reign and due to his nous, Brentford moved from Boston Park cricket ground to a ground of their own in 1904. Serious illness (described as \"paralysis\") saw Molyneux replaced temporarily by trainer Bob Crone and then secretary William Brown until the end of the 1905–06 season, at the end of which his contract was terminated.

It is located in the Southern Railway zone and it is one of the three electric locomotive sheds of the Southern Railway, the others being at Erode (ED) and Arakkonam (AJJ) and is the newest in south India.\n\n## History\n\nSteam locomotive sheds used to exist at Royapuram (RPM) and Basin Bridge (for Madras) until the late 1970s. After Southern Railway set a deadline to eliminate all steam locomotive operations by 1985, a push was given towards establishing electric locomotion as the primary motive power, and the Steam locomotive shed was decommissioned. To meet the needs of exponentially increasing rail traffic on the new continuous broad-gauge lines from Chennai to Kanyakumari and Palakkad with the completion of gauge conversion, the steam shed site was selected by Indian railways for a new electric locomotive shed.\n\nBut in 2006, the Southern Railway planned to lease a portion of the terminus to the corporate sector for developing cement and fertilizer depots. When this move was opposed, the railway allotted 155.5 million for locomotive maintenance shed in 2007. The foundation stone for the electric loco shed, which will be the Southern Railway's third one after Arakkonam and Erode, was laid on 25 January 2007. The loco shed was planned with an initial capacity of 50 locomotives, which would be augmented to 100 and then to 150 in phases with an investment of 450 million, and would have an inspection bay for undertaking scheduled inspections and lifting bay for undertaking both minor and major repairs. A service building for maintenance of various equipment of locomotives was planned, which will have testing and overhauling facilities.\n\nNew Electric shed was inaugurated in 2010. Initially, the shed handed only WAP-1 and WAP-4 class locomotives, but gradually were allocated WAP-7. The first loco to be homed at RPM was the WAP-1 '22000' which was also the first WAP-1 of India. Subsequently, more WAP-1s were transferred from Arakkonam and then the shed started receiving WAP-4s from Erode. The shed got its first WAP-7 numbered '30319' in September 2012. The shed also received new WAP-4 from CLW. In 2016 all WAP-1 were transferred back to make way for the newly allocated WAP-7s and then in 2017 all WAP-4 were transferred back to Erode. By July 2018, Royapuram became a pure 3 Phase only Shed housing only WAP-7 locomotives.\n\nThis shed have WAP-1 and WAP-4 locomotives but now WAP-1s are moved to Arrakonam shed and WAP-4s are moved to Erode shed.\n\n## Operations\n\n* Being one of the three electric engine sheds in Southern Railway, various major and minor maintenance schedules of electric locomotives are carried out here. It has the sanctioned capacity of 110 engine units. Beyond the operating capacity, this shed houses a total of 102 engine units, 102 WAP-7. Electric loco Shed, Royapuram housing the 3rd largest fleet of WAP-7 in Indian Railways and it caters to many long-distance electric trains.\n\nLike all locomotive sheds, RPM does regular maintenance, overhaul and repair including painting and washing of locomotives. It not only attends to locomotives housed at RPM but to ones coming in from other sheds as well. It has four pit lines for loco repair.\n\nLocomotives of Royapuram ELS along with Erode and Arakkonam ELS were the regular links for all trains running through Kerala and Tamil Nadu when widespread electrification of railway lines started in Southern Railways. It handled prestigious trains like the Kerala Express, and the Tamil Nadu Express. RPM locomotives used to be predominantly the regular links for trains traveling to north as well.\n\n## See also\n\n* Electric Loco Shed, Arakkonam\n\n* Electric Loco Shed, Erode\n\n* Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam\n\n* Diesel Loco Shed, Erode\n\n* Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock\n\n* Diesel Loco Shed, Tondiarpet\n\n## External links\n\n* Website\n\n* Particulars\n\n* maps of Indian Railway Loco Sheds\n\n* showing the Royapuram Electric Loco Shed\n\nRoyapuram\n2010 establishments in Tamil Nadu\nRail transport in Chennai"}

Taxa are widespread in temperate and subtropical regions, and are saprobic on wood and bark.\n\n## Description\n\nThe family Melanommataceae was first described by G. Winter in 1885. Members of this family are primarily saprobic, thriving on decaying wood and bark in temperate and subtropical regions. They exhibit diverse morphological characteristics, often producing darkly pigmented, multicellular spores, which contribute to their adaptation to wood-based habitats.\n\n## Ecology\n\nMelanommataceae fungi play a significant role in nutrient cycling and wood decomposition. By breaking down lignin and cellulose, they contribute to the ecological processes that recycle organic matter in forest ecosystems. Their saprobic lifestyle often positions them as crucial components of forest floor biodiversity.\n\n## Genera\n\nThese are the genera that are included in the Melanommataceae family (with estimated number of species in each genus, totaling 1,017 species), according to a 2021 review of fungal classification.

{"id": "32822395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor%20Mamlock%20%28play%29", "title": "Professor Mamlock (play)", "text": "Professor Mamlock is a theater play written by Friedrich Wolf in 1933. Portraying the hardships a Jewish doctor named Hans Mamlock experiences under the Hitler regime, it is one of the earliest works dealing with Nazi antisemitism.\n\n## Characters\n\n* Professor Hans Mamlock, a renowned Jewish surgeon and a decorated World War I veteran, holds conservative political views.\n\n* Ellen Mamlock, the professor's non-Jewish wife, holds right-wing views.\n\n* Rolf Mamlock, the professor's son, a committed communist.\n\n* Ruth Mamlock, the professor's daughter, holds right-wing views.\n\n* Doctor Friedrich Carlsen, attending physician who supervises Mamlock's staff in the clinic and his long-time friend.\n\n* Doctor Hirsch, a Jewish physician in the clinic.\n\n* Doctor Hellpach a physician in the clinic, holds right-wing views.\n\n* Doctor Inge Ruoff a female physician in the clinic and a member of the Nazi Party.\n\n* Nurse Hedwig, the clinic's nurse.\n\n* Simon, a Jewish medic in the clinic.\n\n* Werner Seidel, editor of a liberal newspaper, undergoing an operation in the clinic.\n\n* Ernst, a communist, Rolf's friend.\n\n## Act I\n\nBefore the May 1932 elections, in Mamlock's clinic.\n\nThe personnel and patients in the clinic discuss the political situation. Ruof and Hellpach support Adolf Hitler, while Hirsch and Seidel believe his rise to power will lead to war. Mamlock arrives and forbids conversation about politics in the institute.\n\n## Act II\n\n28 February 1933. Mamlock's house.\n\nRolf claims the Nazis staged the Reichstag fire; after a heated argument with his father, who disapproves of his political stance, Rolf must move out of the residence. Simon arrives and announces that the SA are searching the clinic for 'non-Aryan' doctors. The government decrees that all communists, pacifists, Jews and other opponents of the new regime will be banned from practicing medicine and holding other offices. Ruoff declares she will not be willing to work under a Jew; Hellpach leaves the clinic to join the SS.\n\n## Act III\n\nApril 1933. Mamlock's house.\n\nMamlock is not allowed to enter his clinic by law, while his daughter Ruth is attacked at school. Ruth and Ellen realize that their early, idealistic support of the Nazis was misguided. When Mamlock attempts to talk with Hellpach, who now runs the institute, he encounters a group of SA men who molest him. He returns home a broken man, carrying a Yellow badge.\n\n## Act IV\n\nThe next day, in the clinic.\n\nA new government decree lifts the working ban from all veterans of the First World War. Mamlock and Hirsch return to the clinic. There, Hellpach announces that all 'non-Aryans' who are not subject to the decree will be dismissed. Simon loses his work. Mamlock is revolted by this, and demands justice. He organizes a petition in which he calls upon the government to treat all citizens equally. Hellpach is enraged, and demands from all other personnel to sign an affidavit according to which Mamlock is guilty of various crimes. Mamlock is shocked to see that they all agree to do so – except Ruoff, who rejects her Nazi convictions. He realizes that his friends have abandoned him. Exasperated and despaired, Mamlock tells Inge that she and his son should fight for a better future. Then, he commits suicide.\n\n## Writing\n\nWolf wrote Professor Mamlock shortly after the Reichstag Fire forced him to leave Germany for exile in France; he intended his work to be staged by Gustav von Wangenheim's theater group Truppe 1931. He completed Professor Mamlock while vacating in Île-de-Bréhat. The playwright later told that he conceived the play on the very day after the Fire, when many of his friends called him, blaming him of being a communist and a sympathizer of those who set the Parliament aflame. Consequently, they severed all contacts with him.\n\nWhile the character of Mamlock bears resemblance to the author himself – a Jewish doctor, married to a non-Jewish wife – there was a real man named Professor Hans-Jacques Mamlok (12 April 1875, Koschmin – 11 November 1940, New York) who was a prominent dentist in Germany before the Nazi takeover. He emigrated to the United States, arriving three days after the opening of Professor Mamlock in New York, in April 1937; although he claimed that the play was based on his life, it is unknown whether Wolf was inspired by him.\n\nWolf's earliest version of the play – a 1934 type machine manuscript titled Dr. Mamlocks Ausweg. Ein Schauspiel aus Deutschland 1934 von Friedrich Wolf – portrayed also internal Jewish issues: for example, two rich Jewish bankers were indifferent to the plight of a Jewish street peddler harassed by the SA, and the medic Simon became a Zionist and tried to convince Mamlock to emigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine. While these parts remained in the English and Hebrew editions, they were removed from the German one; Wolf's biographer Henning Müller believed it was due to pressure from officials of the Communist Party of Germany: an unsigned review of the play submitted to the party's exiled leadership in Moscow criticized it for \"emphasizing the race struggle, while the class struggle remains in the background. The party's role is not sufficiently presented.\"\n\nThe play is considered as one of the earliest artistic treatments of the persecution of Jews in Germany.\n\n## Stage productions\n\nTruppe 1931 was dissolved before it could produce Professor Mamlock, and Wolf's piece was first performed in Yiddish, on the stage of the Warsaw Yiddish Art Theater on 19 January 1934, under the title Der Gelbe Fleck ('The Yellow Badge') and starring Alexander Granach; André van Gyseghem and Marie Seton, who traveled from Moscow after securing the rights for an English-language production from Wolf, attended the performance. The next stage adaptation – directed by Leopold Lindtberg under the title Professor Mannheim – was in Hebrew, in Tel Aviv's Habima Theatre, and premiered on 25 July 1934 with Shimon Finkel in the main role. Lindtberg also directed the first German-language production, which was held in Schauspielhaus Zürich on 8 December later that year, again by the name Professor Mannheim. Swiss Nazis disturbed the performances: on several occasions, stench bombs were thrown at the stage. When a cheap-ticket performance was carried in Zürich's Stadttheater, armed riot police had to secure the location, making more than a hundred arrests.\n\nProfessor Mamlock was translated to English by Anne Bromberger in 1935. In Britain, the play was approved by the Lord Chamberlain Cromer, but its planned performance in the Westminster Theatre in 1935 did not take place, apparently due to silent pressure from the Foreign Office on the background of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. It was staged there again in 1939. There was a performance in 1937 by The Bermondsey Repertory Company at Spa Road Library Southwark (Ref:The South London Press, June 8th, 1937). Professor Mamloch was played by Lyall Watson. Joseph Greenspun, a friend of Wolf came to Bermondsey to produce the play. The part of Ruth was played by Doris Brown . The script used was the Federal THeatre version, a copy of which is now held in a collection in Colchester. The English-language version of the play, organized by Federal Theatre Project's Jewish Theater Unit and starring Joseph Anthony as Rolf, eventually premiered in New York's Experimental Theater on 13 April 1937, where it ran for seventy-six performances. In New York, it was attended by some 45,750 people. The New York Times reviewer Brooks Atkinson wrote the production \"reminds us\" the persecution of Jews in Germany \"cannot be effectively represented\" in theater, as it \"may be too great a topic for ordinary make-believe craftsmanship... And this is a theme not for conventional playmakers.\"\n\nIn Sweden, which banned explicit antifascist works due its neutrality and fears from the right-wing press' reaction, Professor Mamlock was the only such play allowed to be performed. Between 1935 and 1943, it was also staged in theaters in Tokyo, Moscow, Amsterdam, Paris, Madrid, Johannesburg, Basel, Oslo, Shanghai, Chongqing and other cities, being viewed by millions. It was the first ever foreign play to be performed in Kazakhstan, where it was produced during the Second World War. After the end of the war, the drama had its German premiere in Berlin's Hebbel Theater, on 9 January 1946, starring Walter Franck. In 1947, a production was staged by the City Theatre of Landsberg am Lech.\n\nWolf was awarded the National Prize of East Germany 2nd degree on 25 August 1949 for writing Professor Mamlock, and the play was entered into the country's schools' curriculum.\n\n## Adaptations\n\nIn 1938, Herbert Rappaport directed the first screen adaptation of Professor Mamlock, filmed in the Soviet Union by the Lenfilm Studio. It starred Semyon Mezhinsky in the title role. A radio drama based on the play was broadcast on Berliner Rundfunk when Wolf worked there as a director. It was aired on 8 November 1945 and had many re-runs. In 1961, the author's son Konrad Wolf directed a second film based on the play, made in East Germany, with Wolfgang Heinz as Mamlock. Between 1963 and 1965, Czechoslovak composer Ladislav Holoubek authored an opera inspired by the theater piece, by the same title.\n\n## Interpretation\n\nPeter Bauland commented that the play portrayed the slow, belated transformation of Mamlock from an a-political person who refuses to acknowledge the reality of the Nazi rule and who keeps having faith in the state to a man who realizes the severity of the situation, after enduring countless humiliations; when Mamlock understands that his faith in law and order is misplaced, it is too late. Wolf contrasted the doctor with his son, the active communist Rolf, who urges to resist the new regime by all means, although his father refuses to listen. Rolf's political convictions reflected Wolf's ideology, and Professor Mamlock had an unambiguous political agenda: \"The play was, unfortunately, also filled with gratuitous leftist propaganda that added nothing to the drama\". John Rodden defined it as a \"committed\" communist work. When it was taught in East German schools, the teachers were instructed to stress out \"the lame resistance to the rise of Hitler by the Weimar Republic and neutral, liberal-humanist professors such as Mamlock.\" As noted by Manuela Gerlof, the character of Mamlock \"embodied the humanist bourgeois.\" Wolf himself wrote that he aimed the play at \"our country's twelve million Mamlocks – the little middle-class intellectuals,\" and claimed that the a-political, lethargic conduct of those not only allowed the Nazis to maintain power, but led them to it in the first place. According to Gerlof, while using the Jewish environment as a setting, Wolf's play targeted the German conservative worldview as a whole. This was also evidenced by the additional title of the play's edition printed in Zürich at 1935: Doktor Mamlocks Ausweg. Tragödie der westlichen Demokratie ('Dr. Mamlock's Way Out. A Tragedy of Western Democracy').\n\n## External links\n\n* Friedrich Wolf: Professor Mamlock, A Play.

Two discs were recorded at two live concerts, sponsored by national radio station triple j, on 13 and 14 November 2009 at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne, Australia. \n\nThe concerts celebrated Kelly's 30th year as a recording artist and were organised by Richard Kingsmill, musical director at Triple J. Kingsmill invited a variety of Australian artists to choose tracks to perform. The third disc consists of Kelly's originals of most of the live tracks. The related video recording of the concerts was issued on 19 February as 2× DVD with 26 live concert tracks on the first disc and back stage interviews with Kelly and some of the performers on the second disc. \n\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 the album won Best Original Soundtrack and the video recording was nominated for Best Music DVD.\n\n## The concert\n\nBefore Too Long: Triple J's Tribute to Paul Kelly celebrates Paul Kelly's 30th anniversary as a recording artist. Richard Kingsmill, musical director at national radio station, Triple J organised two tribute concerts: he asked various Australian artists to perform their favourite Kelly tracks. Kingsmill announced the tribute on air \"[t]here is a huge amount of respect and admiration within the Australian music industry – not to mention the public as well – for Paul and all that he's achieved. He is one of our songwriting greats and worthy of celebrating\". \n\nThe concerts were held on 13 and 14 November at the Forum Theatre, Melbourne.

Greenberg felt that Megan Washington \"steals the show early on with powerful vocals that rise above the audio mess\", followed by Paul Dempsey providing a \"tinkling, twinkling country song\". Later Missy Higgins performance was \"an excellent (and excellent-sounding) bit of crooning and acoustic piano that brings the sound back to a more intimate nature\".\n\nJulia Winterflood of BMA Magazine described the album as a \"glorious, triumphant and moving testament\" which portrays Kelly as \"not only an unbridled rocker and exceptionally brilliant balladeer, but a poet, too\". Writing for The West Australian, Simon Collins praised Naylor's effort on the title track, Washington's \"soft side with an a cappella version of 'Meet Me in the Middle of the Air'\", and Adalita's \"spoken-word performance of 'Everything's Turning to White' ... not long after the death of her bandmate Dean Turner, is also touching\". Turner of Magic Dirt had died in August 2009 of tissue cancer, aged 37.\n\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 the album won Best Original Soundtrack, the trophy was collected by Kingsmill and Naylor on behalf of all the artists involved.

It covers an area of 13,075.28 km2, and had a population of 70,619 at the 2010 Census, and 118,679 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as of mid-2023 was 129,963 (comprising 68,564 males and 61,399 females). Its administrative centre is the town of Aimas. Sorong Regency surrounds Sorong City (Kota) on the landward side; the city is administratively independent of the Regency and is not included in the above statistics; Sorong City has an airport, Sorong Airport, which also serves the Regency.\n\n## Geography\n\nSorong Regency is one of the regencies which is administratively included in the territory of the new Southwest Papua Province.

{"id": "58539049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillman%20Pond", "title": "Stillman Pond", "text": "Stillman Pond (October 26, 1803 – September 30, 1878) – a farmer, harnessmaker, and land speculator by trade, and a native of Hubbardston, Worcester, Massachusetts – was a Mormon pioneer and church leader recognized for the great personal sacrifices he made in the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois, to the Great Basin's Salt Lake Valley (September 1846 – September 1847), in what would later become Utah Territory.\n\n## Massachusetts: the beginnings of joy and affliction\n\nStillman Pond was the descendant of hardy colonial New England progenitors of the Puritan persuasion, many of whom served as ministers and selectmen of various townships. The Massachusetts native was born only two years before the birth of the prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., with whom he shared a common ancestry (in separatist minister John Lathrop, 1584–1653) and whose fledgling American religion he would one day embrace.\n\nWhile Stillman's paternal grandfather, Joseph Pond (b. 1756) was a Revolutionary War soldier, his great-great-grandfather Ezra Pond (b. 1692) was a restless, dissatisfied pastor of a local Franklin, Massachusetts congregation. In the Puritan spirit of Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson, Ezra refused to comply with the orders of the community elders, and he was forced to leave town, moving with his family to Hubbardston. Stillman's maternal great-great-grandfather was Lt. Paul Moore (b. 1711), an American army commander at the Battle of Bunker Hill.\n\nPerhaps because of the firebrand nature of his religious heritage, a passionate, restless strain of spiritual fervor seemed to course, as it were, through Stillman's veins. It was this spirit that later would move him, in the autumn of 1843, to commit his growing family to making an arduous trek across five states to a burgeoning new city on the Mississippi – Nauvoo, Illinois – where they might join with the relentlessly driven body of Latter-day Saints there assembling.\n\nStillman himself – a farmer, harnessmaker, and land speculator by trade – was ever thrifty and industrious from the days of his youth, always ensuring that he sold at a profit. Marrying in 1825 one Almyra Whittemore, he removed to Westminster, Worcester, Massachusetts, where he purchased several tracts of land. There he remained until 1832, when he moved to Templeton. Almyra bore him 5 children (four girls and one boy), but at age 33 she died in the yellow fever epidemic that swept through New England in 1833 and was buried at Hubbardston.\n\n## Mormon convert and polygamist\n\nA young widower now with five children, Stillman Pond would ultimately marry five times and produce a multitudinous posterity.\n\nMarrying again for the first time in 1834, to one Maria Louisa Davis, Stillman settled again at Hubbardston, but moved his family in 1837 to New Salem, Massachusetts, purchasing there three tracts of land over the next five years. There, he and his family fostered new friendships, including with the Haskell family (later reuniting with them at Nauvoo). Most significantly, it was at New Salem in 1841 that Stillman and his family welcomed into their home traveling Mormon missionaries and were converted, through their efforts, to the new faith that Smith had founded a decade earlier. The family was baptized on December 28, 1841 under the hand of Elder Elias Harris.\n\nThe Mormon message, which afforded hope for his loved ones, both living and dead, filled Stillman's troubled soul with great comfort and peace. Able to sell his land in order to join the Missouri-driven Latter-day Saints at Nauvoo, Illinois, Stillman and his family, having embraced 'the New Covenant,' made their trek in the fall of 1843.\n\n## Nauvoo merchant, Elder and Seventy\n\nIn the would-be refuge of the 'City Beautiful' Stillman built a two-story red brick home (in the front part of which he established a store) a few blocks southwest of the Nauvoo Temple on Munson Street (block 106) – equidistant at points east and north from the banks of the mighty Mississippi, which forms the city's southern and western borders.\n\nTheir new neighbor, as Stillman soon discovered, was a latter-day Apostle of the Lord, for not only did the edifice lay but 'a few rods' west of the homes of friends and fellow converts Winslow Farr and his son Lorin, but also just east of the historic red-brick residence of Mormon Apostle Heber C. Kimball – confidante and councilor to the Mormon Prophet of the Restoration, Joseph Smith, Jr. Another apostle, moreover, resided on the same block – Wilford Woodruff – whose red-brick home stood just north of the Farr homes on Durphy Street.\n\nThe Pond family home & store (1843–1846) was thus situated west of the intersection at Durphy and Munson Streets (its site excavated in 1970 by Nauvoo Restoration Inc.) – on the same 4-acre 'lower city' lot where, in their restored incarnations, the historic Kimball, Woodruff, and Farr homes can be seen today (the Winslow Farr home is at the intersection's northwest corner).\n\nOrdained an Elder of the church in July 1844 (only weeks after the Prophet Joseph's martyrdom), Stillman received his patriarchal blessing under the hands of the Prophet's uncle, John Smith, on January 1, 1845, and that same year (17 May) became a member of the church's 2nd Quorum of Seventy, receiving also with his wife (and his first wife by proxy) the ordinance of the holy Endowment in the still unfinished Nauvoo Temple on December 30.\n\nStillman, on February 12, 1846, wrote: 'I am perfectly satisfied with the authorities of the Church and consider it my indispensable duty to give heed to all things.' Not long after, his young married housekeeper Irene Haskell Pomeroy – who assisted Sister Pond in her ongoing recuperation following the tragic January 1845 death of infant son Charles Stillman Pond – observed firsthand Stillman's commitment to that personal mandate: 'Team after team is going over the river every day for the west ... Brother Pond has gone to help some over the river ...'\n\n## Faithful flight: Winter Quarters tragedy & Mormon trek West\n\nThe Pond family – after surviving the Battle of Nauvoo against their intolerant oppressors, as well as the vile persecutions which followed – took their flight from the city at the point of bayonet in the fall of 1846. They were among the last of the persecuted Saints to leave Illinois. Stillman's family (including Maria, who was pregnant with twins), together with the other Mormon exiles, were left to stumble on to Winter Quarters across the frozen flats of Iowa.\n\nThroughout that bitterly cold, disease-infested season (as they lived in tents on the Nebraska bank of the Missouri River) – with hardships to come thereafter, in the John Taylor-led 1847 trek across the Great Plains to Utah's Salt Lake basin – Stillman lost to sickness and to death his beloved wife and little-kingdom of 8 children.\n\nFor after the death of infant-son Charles in Nauvoo, the Ponds now lose, on their forced September exodus to Winter Quarters, not only 9-year-old son Lowell Ansen Pond, but also, in mounting grief, malaria-wracked Maria's newborn twin sons. In what was both christening and burial, they honored the infants with the names of the martyred Smith brothers, Joseph and Hyrum. All three sons were buried along the trail in shallow graves in the frozen ground.\n\nBut for Stillman and Maria Pond, suddenly bereft as they were of four small children, an already-devastating sacrifice was far from finished. For then is recorded, in the journals of pioneers Horace K. Whitney and Helen Mar Kimball Whitney, the deaths of four additional Pond children after the destitute family's October 16 arrival at the Nebraska encampment – with three of the Ponds' daughters all dying within one five-day period alone:\n\n'On Wednesday, the 2nd of December 1846, Laura Jane Pond, age 14 years, ... died of chills and fever.' Two days later on 'Friday, the 4th of December 1846, Harriet M. Pond, age 11 years, ... died with chills.' Three days later, 'Monday, the 7th of December, 1846, Abigail A. Pond, age 18 years [and a plural bride of Presiding Bishop Newell K. Whitney] ... died with chills.' Just five weeks later, 'Friday, the 15th of January, 1847, Lyman Pond, age 6 years, ... died with chills and fever.'\n\nUrsula Billings Hastings Haskell, fellow 'Camp of Israel' saint, and friend of the Pond family from their New Salem days together (and whose housekeeper-daughter Irene had boarded in an apartment in Stillman's Nauvoo home), later wrote in a letter: 'I suppose you have heard of the deaths in Brother Ponds family. The children are all dead but Elizabeth and Loenza.' Sister Haskell then explained in her letter that the family became ill before arriving at Winter Quarters when Brother Pond paused to earn some money for his family's survival in an unhealthy location, 'a very sickly town' out of the way. 'Lowell died before they arrived, the rest lived to get here and then dropped away one after another. Sister Pond has not recovered and I fear she never will.'\n\nAll of the marked Pond siblings perished over an 8-month period in the unforgiving elements of their harsh environs, including, finally, on May 17, 1847, a grief-stricken Maria herself (who, though weakened by malaria, was ultimately overcome by 'consumption' or tuberculosis). And Stillman, once more a widower, unspeakably grieved for each and every one. On too-frequent occasion, moreover, he found himself straddling the threshold of death. But 'the fire of the New Covenant' burned brightly in Stillman's soul, and it was that which, after leaving the Missouri River encampment on June 17, gave him the strength to press on to the mountains of the West, where he knew he would find the Zion that God had prepared for His saints.\n\n## Abigail Thorn and a Prophet's mantle\n\nStillman's third wife, Abigail Thorn, whom he married at the Endowment House at Salt Lake City in 1849 and by whom he would have 8 additional children, was the abandoned plural spouse of Major Samuel Russell who had, only a year earlier, deserted Abigail and their own newborn infant in preference for the gold fields of California. Stillman had been a member of the same (combined Smoot-Wallace-Russell) 'Camp of Israel' company as the Russells in the trek to Utah (arriving September 25, 1847), and he had since established himself in farming to the west of the city, where he'd witnessed the saving of his locust-infested crops in 1848 by the miraculous arrival of seagulls.\n\nFor her part, Abigail – born into a respected family at Lair, Cayuga, New York, on April 2, 1821 – had experienced a powerful conversion to the Mormon faith as a young woman. The same glorious spirit which had so moved her then, had again urged her to join with the Saints at Nauvoo. There, at the age of 22, she received in the spring of 1843 her patriarchal blessing under the hands of Hyrum Smith, the Prophet's brother, just fifteen months before his martyrdom at Carthage. Hyrum blessed her with the gift of dreams and visions by the Holy Ghost (she would also enjoy in her life the gift of tongues and a keen discernment of spirits). Hers was the special privilege of witnessing at Nauvoo on August 8, 1844, as scores of accounts that were recorded at the time attest, the transfiguration of Brigham Young, when the mantle and unmistakable voice of the Prophet Joseph Smith fell upon him as a special sign to the Saints of his high calling and acceptance of the Lord to lead His people.\n\n## Pioneering at Spanish Fork and Cache Valley\n\nLike Zebedee Coltrin and other Saints who preceded them, Stillman and Abigail removed south from Salt Lake to Spanish Fork in 1857. But less than three years later, in 1860, they turned back again, this time to Cache Valley's Richmond in the far north – just months before shots were fired at Fort Sumter in the East the following spring. Their hard-won livelihoods passed quietly during the years of national Civil War. The Ponds considered themselves greatly blessed.\n\n## Endowment officiator, Seventy's President and Apostolic mentoree\n\nStillman had been able to officiate in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City under the supervision of President Heber C. Kimball, but also, at the Council House, to be mentored in mathematics and astronomy in the evenings under the clear, guiding voice of Apostle Orson Pratt.\n\nIn 1852 Stillman had once again married, this time to Elizabeth Bessac, by whom he was given another child. But his fourth wife divorced him a few years later and married another man. Yet was Stillman's fidelity and obedience rewarded by church leaders, and on February 16, 1853 he was ordained Senior President of the 35th Quorum of Seventy – a calling and capacity he faithfully fulfilled for the remainder of his days.\n\n## Eldest son, ZCMI investor and St. George Temple laborer\n\nNotwithstanding those hard-life years in Richmond, Stillman received for his comfort (on June 25, 1865) a second patriarchal blessing under the hand of Patriarch Charles W. Hyde – just weeks after the assassination of President Lincoln (Stillman's eldest daughter by Abigail, Mary Anner Pond, only 4 weeks before Lincoln's death, had married John Buxton, an English immigrant who became a successful businessman in Teton Valley, Idaho; they raised 12 children).\n\nThree years after receiving his second patriarchal blessing, Stillman returned to his natal home of Hubbardston, Massachusetts, upon the occasion of his father's passing. There, he secured his 'eldest' son's portion of his father's estate, returning again to Utah to invest his inheritance in the Richmond Co-op, known as the ZCMI – an investment that proved to be a wise and profitable one. In his later years, Stillman would travel south to St. George to assist in hauling quarry-stone for the building of a temple there.\n\n## Final years and family legacy\n\nIn 1870 Stillman married for a fifth and final time. A widow, Anna Regina Svensson-Jacobsen (alternatively, 'Swenson'), bore him an additional four sons before his death at age 74 (after a two-year lingering illness) on September 30, 1878. Third wife Abigail died 26 years later on March 7, 1904.\n\nBy all of these wives Stillman would become grand-patriarch to a sea of descendants scattered throughout the intermountain West (and beyond) bearing such names as Buxton, Bowen, Merrill, Whittle, Kingsbury, Lewis, Lear, Egbert, Read, Pope, Telford, Yeats, Van Noy, Rose, and Russell. From a foundation of noble progenitors, Stillman left his multitudinous posterity with a mighty 'fire of faith' legacy – one of sacrifice, endurance, and forging ahead (despite overwhelming heartache and loss) to realize, at last, through unflinching tenacity, persistent labor and love, a useful, abundant, and well-lived life.\n\n## References\n\n* .\n\n* .\n\n* .\n\n* .\n\n* .\n\n* .\n\n* .

{"id": "41971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers%20Grimm", "title": "Brothers Grimm", "text": "The Brothers Grimm ( or ), Jacob (1785–1863) and Wilhelm (1786–1859), were German academics who together collected and published folklore. The brothers are among the best-known storytellers of folktales, popularizing stories such as \"Cinderella\" (\"), \"The Frog Prince\" (\"\"), \"Hansel and Gretel\" (\"), \"Town Musicians of Bremen\" (\"\"), \"Little Red Riding Hood\" (\"\"), \"Rapunzel\", \"Rumpelstiltskin\" (\"\"), \"Sleeping Beauty\" (\"\"), and \"Snow White\" (\"\"). Their first collection of folktales, Children's and Household Tales (), was first published in 1812.\n\nThe Brothers Grimm spent their formative years in the town of Hanau in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. Their father's death in 1796 (when Jacob was 11 and Wilhelm 10) caused great poverty for the family and affected the brothers many years after. Both brothers attended the University of Marburg, where they developed a curiosity about German folklore, which grew into a lifelong dedication to collecting German folktales.\n\nThe rise of Romanticism in 19th-century Europe revived interest in traditional folk stories, which to the Brothers Grimm represented a pure form of national literature and culture. With the goal of researching a scholarly treatise on folktales, they established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories that became the basis for folklore studies. Between 1812 and 1857 their first collection was revised and republished many times, growing from 86 stories to more than 200. In addition to writing and modifying folktales, the brothers wrote collections of well-respected Germanic and Scandinavian mythologies, and in 1838 they began writing a definitive German dictionary (), which they were unable to finish.\n\nThe popularity of the Grimms' collected folktales has endured. They are available in more than 100 translations and have been adapted by renowned filmmakers, including Lotte Reiniger and Walt Disney, in films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In the mid-20th century, Nazi Germany weaponized the tales for propaganda; later in the 20th century, psychologists such as Bruno Bettelheim reaffirmed the work's value despite the sexuality, cruelty, and violence in some of the tales' original versions, which were eventually censored by the Grimms themselves.\n\n## Early lives\n\nJacob Ludwig Karl Grimm and Wilhelm Carl Grimm were born on 4 January 1785 and 24 February 1786, respectively, in Hanau in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, within the Holy Roman Empire (present-day Germany), to Philipp Wilhelm Grimm, a jurist, and Dorothea Grimm (née Zimmer), daughter of a Kassel city councilman. They were the second- and third-eldest surviving siblings in a family of nine children, three of whom died in infancy. In 1791 the family moved to the countryside town of Steinau during Philipp's employment there as a district magistrate (). The family became prominent members of the community, residing in a large home surrounded by fields. Biographer Jack Zipes writes that the brothers were happy in Steinau and \"clearly fond of country life\". The children were educated at home by private tutors, receiving strict instruction as Lutherans, which instilled in both a lifelong religious faith. Later, they attended local schools.\n\nIn 1796 Philipp Grimm died of pneumonia, causing great poverty for the large family. Dorothea was forced to relinquish the brothers' servants and large house, depending on financial support from her father and sister, who was then the first lady-in-waiting at the court of William I, Elector of Hesse. Jacob was the eldest living son, forced at age 11 to assume adult responsibilities (shared with Wilhelm) for the next two years. The two brothers then followed the advice of their grandfather, who continually exhorted them to be industrious.\n\nThe brothers left Steinau and their family in 1798 to attend the in Kassel, which had been arranged and paid for by their aunt. By then they were without a male provider (their grandfather died that year), forcing them to rely entirely on each other and become exceptionally close. The two brothers differed in temperament—Jacob was introspective and Wilhelm was outgoing (although he often suffered from ill health)—but shared a strong work ethic and excelled in their studies. In Kassel they became acutely aware of their inferior social status relative to \"high-born\" students who received more attention. Each brother graduated at the head of his class, Jacob in 1803 and Wilhelm in 1804 (he missed a year of school due to scarlet fever).\n\n## Marburg\n\nAfter graduation from the , the brothers attended the University of Marburg. The university was small with about 200 students, and there they became painfully aware that students of lower social status were not treated equally. They were disqualified from admission because of their social standing and had to request a dispensation to study law. Wealthier students received stipends, but the brothers were excluded even from tuition aid. Their poverty kept them from student activities or university social life, but their outsider status worked in their favor and they pursued their studies with extra vigor.\n\nInspired by their law professor, Friedrich von Savigny, who awakened in them an interest in history and philology, the brothers studied medieval German literature. They shared Savigny's desire to see the unification of the 200 German principalities into a single state. Through Savigny and his circle of friends—German romantics such as Clemens Brentano and Ludwig Achim von Arnim—the Grimms were introduced to the ideas of Johann Gottfried Herder, who thought that German literature should revert to simpler forms, which he defined as (natural poetry)—as opposed to (artistic poetry). The brothers dedicated themselves with great enthusiasm to their studies, of which Wilhelm wrote in his autobiography, \"the ardor with which we studied Old German helped us overcome the spiritual depression of those days.\"\n\nJacob was still financially responsible for his mother, brother, and younger siblings in 1805, so he accepted a post in Paris as Savigny's research assistant. On his return to Marburg he was forced to abandon his studies to support the family, whose poverty was so extreme that food was often scarce, and take a job with the Hessian War Commission. In a letter to his aunt from this time, Wilhelm wrote of their circumstances: \"We five people eat only three portions and only once a day\".\n\n## Kassel\n\nJacob found full-time employment in 1808 when he was appointed court librarian to the King of Westphalia and went on to become a librarian in Kassel. After their mother's death that year, he became fully responsible for his younger siblings. He arranged and paid for his brother Ludwig's studies at art school and for Wilhelm's extended visit to Halle to seek treatment for heart and respiratory ailments, after which Wilhelm joined Jacob as librarian in Kassel At Brentano's request, the brothers had begun collecting folk tales in a cursory manner in 1807. According to Zipes, at this point \"the Grimms were unable to devote all their energies to their research and did not have a clear idea about the significance of collecting folk tales in this initial phase.\"\n\nDuring their employment as librarians—which paid little but afforded them ample time for research—the brothers experienced a productive period of scholarship, publishing books between 1812 and 1830. In 1812 they published their first volume of 86 folk tales, , followed quickly by two volumes of German legends and a volume of early literary history. They went on to publish works about Danish and Irish folk tales (and also Norse mythology), while continuing to edit the German folk tale collection. These works became so widely recognized that the brothers received honorary doctorates from universities in Marburg, Berlin, and Breslau (now Wrocław).\n\n## Göttingen\n\nOn 15 May 1825 Wilhelm married Henriette Dorothea Dortchen Wild, a pharmacist's daughter and childhood friend who had given the brothers several tales. Jacob never married but continued to live in the household with Wilhelm and Dortchen. In 1830 both brothers were overlooked when the post of chief librarian came available, which disappointed them greatly. They moved the household to Göttingen in the Kingdom of Hanover, where they took employment at the University of Göttingen—Jacob as a professor and head librarian and Wilhelm as a professor.\n\nFor the next seven years the brothers continued to research, write, and publish. In 1835 Jacob published the well-regarded German Mythology (); Wilhelm continued to edit and prepare the third edition of for publication. The two brothers taught German studies at the university, becoming well-respected in the newly established discipline.\n\nIn 1837 the brothers lost their university posts after joining the rest of the Göttingen Seven in protest. The 1830s were a period of political upheaval and peasant revolt in Germany, leading to the movement for democratic reform known as Young Germany. The brothers were not directly aligned with the Young Germans, but they and five of their colleagues reacted against the demands of Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, who in 1837 dissolved the parliament of Hanover and demanded oaths of allegiance from civil servants—including professors at the University of Göttingen. For refusing to sign the oath, the seven professors were dismissed and three were deported from Hanover—including Jacob, who went to Kassel. He was later joined there by Wilhelm, Dortchen, and their four children.\n\nThe brothers were without income and again in extreme financial difficulty in 1838, so they began what would become a lifelong project—the writing of a definitive dictionary, the German Dictionary ()—whose first volume was not published until 1854. The brothers again depended on friends and supporters for financial assistance and influence in finding employment.\n\n## Berlin and later years\n\nIn 1840, Savigny and Bettina von Arnim appealed successfully to Frederick William IV of Prussia on behalf of the brothers, who were offered posts at the University of Berlin. In addition to teaching posts, the Academy of Sciences offered them stipends to continue their research. Once they had established their household in Berlin they directed their efforts towards the work on the German dictionary and continued to publish their research. Jacob turned his attention to researching German legal traditions and the history of the German language, which was published in the late 1840s and early 1850s; Wilhelm began researching medieval literature while editing new editions of .\n\nAfter the revolutions of 1848 in the German states the brothers were elected to the civil parliament. Jacob became a prominent member of the National Assembly at Mainz. But their political activities were short-lived, as their hope for a unified Germany dwindled and their disenchantment grew. In the late 1840s Jacob resigned his university position and published The History of the German Language (). Wilhelm continued at his university post until 1852. After retiring from teaching, the brothers devoted themselves to the German Dictionary for the rest of their lives. Wilhelm died of an infection in Berlin on 16 December 1859, and Jacob, deeply upset by his death, became increasingly reclusive. He continued working on the dictionary until his own death on 20 September 1863. Zipes writes of the Grimms' dictionary, and of their very large body of work: \"Symbolically the last word was (fruit).\"\n\n## Background\n\nThe rise of romanticism, romantic nationalism, and trends in valuing popular culture in the early 19th century revived interest in fairy tales, which had declined since their late 17th-century peak. Johann Karl August Musäus published a popular collection of tales called between 1782 and 1787; the Grimms aided the revival with their folklore collection, built on the conviction that a national identity could be found in popular culture and with the common folk (). They collected and published their tales as a reflection of German cultural identity. In the first collection, though, they included Charles Perrault's tales, published in Paris in 1697 and written for the literary salons of an aristocratic French audience. Scholar Lydie Jean says that Perrault created a myth that his tales came from the common people and reflected existing folklore to justify including them—even though many of them were original.\n\nThe brothers were directly influenced by Brentano and von Arnim, who edited and adapted the folk songs of (The Boy's Magic Horn or cornucopia). They began the collection with the purpose of creating a scholarly treatise of traditional stories, and of preserving the stories as they had been handed from generation to generation—a practice threatened by increased industrialization. Maria Tatar, professor of German studies at Harvard University, argues that it is precisely the handing from generation to generation and the genesis in the oral tradition that gives folk tales important mutability. Versions of tales differ from region to region, \"picking up bits and pieces of local culture and lore, drawing a turn of phrase from a song or another story, and fleshing out characters with features taken from the audience witnessing their performance.\"\n\nBut Tatar argues that the Grimms appropriated as uniquely German stories, such as \"Little Red Riding Hood\", that had existed in many versions and regions throughout Europe, because they believed that such stories reflected Germanic culture. Furthermore, the brothers saw fragments of old religions and faiths reflected in the stories, which they thought continued to exist and survive through the telling of stories.\n\n## Methodology\n\nWhen Jacob returned to Marburg from Paris in 1806, their friend Brentano sought the brothers' help in adding to his collection of folk tales, at which time the brothers began to gather tales in an organized fashion. By 1810 they had produced a manuscript collection of several dozen tales, written after inviting storytellers to their home and transcribing what they heard. These tales were heavily modified in transcription; many had roots in previously written sources. At Brentano's request, they printed and sent him copies of the 53 tales that they collected for inclusion in his third volume of . Brentano either ignored or forgot about the tales, leaving the copies in a church in Alsace where they were found in 1920 and became known as the Ölenberg manuscript. It is the earliest extant version of the Grimms' collection and has become a valuable source to scholars studying the development of the Grimms' collection from the time of its inception. The manuscript was published in 1927 and again in 1975.\n\nThe brothers gained a reputation for collecting tales from peasants, although many tales came from middle-class or aristocratic acquaintances. Wilhelm's wife, Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild, and her family, with their nursery maid, told the brothers some of the more well-known tales, such as \"Hansel and Gretel\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\". Wilhelm collected some tales after befriending August von Haxthausen, whom he visited in 1811 in Westphalia where he heard stories from von Haxthausen's circle of friends. Several of the storytellers were of Huguenot ancestry, telling tales of French origin such as those told to the Grimms by Marie Hassenpflug, an educated woman of French Huguenot ancestry, and it is probable that these informants were familiar with Perrault's (Stories from Past Times). Other tales were collected from Dorothea Viehmann, the wife of a middle-class tailor and also of French descent. Despite her middle-class background, in the first English translation she was characterized as a peasant and given the name . At least one tale, Gevatter Tod (Grim Reaper), was provided by composer Wilhelmine Schwertzell, with whom Wilhelm had a long correspondence.\n\nAccording to scholars such as Tatar and Ruth Bottigheimer, some of the tales probably originated in written form during the medieval period with writers such as Straparola and Boccaccio, but were modified in the 17th century and again rewritten by the Grimms. Moreover, Tatar writes that the brothers' goal of preserving and shaping the tales as something uniquely German at a time of French occupation was a form of \"intellectual resistance\", and in so doing they established a methodology for collecting and preserving folklore that set the model followed later by writers throughout Europe during periods of occupation.\n\n## Writing\n\nFrom 1807 onward, the brothers added to the collection. Jacob established the framework, maintained through many iterations; from 1815 until his death, Wilhelm assumed sole responsibility for editing and rewriting the tales. He made the tales stylistically similar, added dialogue, removed pieces \"that might detract from a rustic tone\", improved the plots, and incorporated psychological motifs. Ronald Murphy writes in The Owl, the Raven, and the Dove that the brothers, particularly Wilhelm, also added religious and spiritual motifs to the tales. He believes that Wilhelm \"gleaned\" bits from old Germanic faiths, Norse mythology, Roman and Greek mythology, and biblical stories that he reshaped.\n\nOver the years, Wilhelm worked extensively on the prose; he expanded and added detail to the stories to the point that many of them grew to twice the length they had in the earliest published editions. In the later editions Wilhelm polished the language to make it more enticing to a bourgeois audience, eliminated sexual elements, and added Christian elements. After 1819 he began writing original tales for children (children were not initially considered the primary audience) and adding didactic elements to existing tales.\n\nSome changes were made in light of unfavorable reviews, particularly from those who objected that not all the tales were suitable for children because of scenes of violence and sexuality. He worked to modify plots for many of the stories; for example, \"Rapunzel\" in the first edition of clearly shows a sexual relationship between the prince and the girl in the tower, which he edited out in subsequent editions. Tatar writes that morals were added (in the second edition a king's regret was added to the scene in which his wife is to be burned at the stake) and often the characters in the tale were amended to appear more German: \"every fairy (), prince () and princess ()—all words of French origin—was transformed into a more Teutonic-sounding enchantress () or wise woman (), king's son (), king's daughter ().\"\n\n## Themes and analysis\n\nThe Grimms' legacy contains legends, novellas, and folk stories, the vast majority of which were not intended as children's tales. Von Arnim was concerned about the content of some of the tales—such as those that showed children being eaten—and suggested adding a subtitle to warn parents of the content. Instead the brothers added an introduction with cautionary advice that parents steer children toward age-appropriate stories. Despite von Arnim's unease, none of the tales were eliminated from the collection; the brothers believed that all the tales were of value and reflected inherent cultural qualities. Furthermore, the stories were didactic in nature at a time when discipline relied on fear, according to scholar Linda Dégh, who explains that tales such as \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and \"Hansel and Gretel\" were written as \"warning tales\" for children.\n\nThe stories in include scenes of violence that have since been sanitized. For example, in the Grimms' original version of \"Snow White\", the Queen is Little Snow White's mother, not her stepmother, but still orders her Huntsman to kill Snow White (her biological daughter) and bring home the child's lungs and liver so that she can eat them; the story ends with the Queen dancing at Snow White's wedding, wearing a pair of red-hot iron shoes that kill her. Another story, \"The Goose Girl\", has a servant stripped naked and pushed into a barrel \"studded with sharp nails\" pointing inward and then rolled down the street. The Grimms' version of \"The Frog Prince\" describes the princess throwing the frog against a wall instead of kissing him. To some extent the cruelty and violence may reflected the medieval culture from which the tales originated, such as scenes of witches burning, as described in \"The Six Swans\".\n\nTales with a spinning motif are broadly represented in the collection. In her essay \"Tale Spinners: Submerged Voices in Grimms' Fairy Tales\", Bottigheimer argues that these stories reflect the degree to which spinning was crucial in the life of women in the 19th century and earlier. Spinning, particularly of flax, was commonly performed in the home by women. Many stories begin by describing the occupation of their main character, as in \"There once was a miller\", yet spinning is never mentioned as an occupation; this appears to be because the brothers did not consider it an occupation. Instead, spinning was a communal activity, frequently performed in a (spinning room), a place where women most likely kept the oral traditions alive by telling stories while engaged in tedious work. In the stories, a woman's personality is often represented by her attitude toward spinning; a wise woman might be a spinster and Bottigheimer writes that the spindle was the symbol of a \"diligent, well-ordered womanhood\". In some stories, such as \"Rumpelstiltskin\", spinning is associated with a threat; in others, spinning might be avoided by a character who is either too lazy or not accustomed to spinning because of her high social status.\n\nThe Grimms' work have been subjected to feminist critique. For example, Emma Tennant writes:\n\nThe tales were also criticized for being insufficiently German, which influenced the tales that the brothers included and their use of language. But scholars such as Heinz Rölleke say that the stories are an accurate depiction of German culture, showing \"rustic simplicity [and] sexual modesty\". German culture is deeply rooted in the forest (), a dark dangerous place to be avoided, most particularly the old forests with large oak trees, and yet a place where Little Red Riding Hood's mother sent her daughter to deliver food to her grandmother's house.\n\nSome critics, such as Alistair Hauke, use Jungian analysis to say that the deaths of the brothers' father and grandfather are the reason for the Grimms' tendency to idealize and excuse fathers, as well as the predominance of female villains in the tales, such as the wicked stepmother and stepsisters in \"Cinderella\". However, this disregards the fact that they were collectors, not authors of the tales. Another possible influence is found in stories such as \"The Twelve Brothers\", which mirrors the brothers' family structure of several brothers facing and overcoming opposition. Some of the tales have autobiographical elements, and according to Zipes the work may have been a \"quest\" to replace the family life lost after their father died. The collection includes 41 tales about siblings, which Zipes says are representative of Jacob and Wilhelm. Many of the sibling stories follow a simple plot where the characters lose a home, work industriously at a specific task, and in the end find a new home.\n\n## Editions\n\nBetween 1812 and 1864, was published 17 times: seven of the \"Large edition\" () and ten of the \"Small edition\" (). The Large editions contained all the tales collected to date, extensive annotations, and scholarly notes written by the brothers; the Small editions had only 50 tales and were intended for children. Emil Grimm, Jacob and Wilhelm's younger brother, illustrated the Small editions, adding Christian symbolism to the drawings, such as depicting Cinderella's mother as an angel and adding a Bible to the bedside table of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother.\n\nThe first volume was published in 1812 with 86 folk tales, and a second volume with 70 additional tales was published late in 1814 (dated 1815 on the title page); together the two volumes and their 156 tales are considered the first of the (annotated) Large editions. A second expanded edition with 170 tales was published in 1819, followed in 1822 by a volume of scholarly commentary and annotations. Five more Large editions were published in 1837, 1840, 1843, 1850, and 1857. The seventh and final edition of 1857 contained 211 tales—200 numbered folk tales and 11 legends.\n\nIn Germany , commonly Grimms' Fairy Tales in English, was also released in a \"popular poster-sized (broadsides)\" format and in single-story formats for the more popular tales such as \"Hansel and Gretel\". The stories were often added to collections by other authors without respect to copyright as the tales became a focus of interest for children's book illustrators, with well-known artists such as Arthur Rackham, Walter Crane, and Edmund Dulac illustrating. Another popular edition released in the mid-19th century included elaborate etchings by George Cruikshank. Upon the brothers' deaths, the copyright went to Wilhelm's son Hermann Grimm, who continued the practice of printing the volumes in expensive and complete editions, but after 1893, when copyright lapsed, various publishers began to print the stories in many formats and editions. In the 21st century, is a universally recognized text. Jacob's and Wilhelm's collection of stories has been translated to more than 160 languages; 120 different editions of the text are available for sale in the US alone.\n\n## Philology\n\nWhile at the University of Marburg, the brothers came to see culture as tied to language and regarded the purest cultural expression in the grammar of a language. They moved away from Brentano's practice—and that of the other romanticists—who frequently changed original oral styles of folk tale to a more literary style, which the brothers considered artificial. They thought that the style of the people (the ) reflected a natural and divinely inspired poetry ()—as opposed to the (art poetry), which they saw as artificially constructed. As literary historians and scholars they delved into the origins of stories and attempted to retrieve them from the oral tradition without loss of the original traits of oral language.\n\nThe brothers strongly believed that the dream of national unity and independence relied on a full knowledge of the cultural past that was reflected in folklore. They worked to discover and crystallize a kind of Germanness in the stories they collected in the belief that folklore contained kernels of mythologies and legends crucial to understanding the essence of German culture. In examining culture from a philological point of view they sought to establish connections between German law, culture, and local beliefs.\n\nThe Grimms considered the tales to have origins in traditional Germanic folklore, which they thought had been \"contaminated\" by later literary tradition. In the shift from the oral tradition to the printed book, tales were translated from regional dialects to Standard German ( or High German). But over the course of the many modifications and revisions, the Grimms sought to reintroduce regionalisms, dialects, and Low German to the tales—to reintroduce the language of the original form of the oral tale.\n\nAs early as 1812 they published (The Two Oldest German Poems of the Eighth Century: The Song of Hildebrand and Hadubrand and the Wessobrunn Prayer); the Song of Hildebrand and Hadubrand is a ninth-century German heroic song, while the Wessobrunn Prayer is the earliest-known German heroic song.\n\nBetween 1816 and 1818 the brothers published a two-volume work, (German Legends), consisting of 585 German legends. Jacob undertook most of the work of collecting and editing the legends, which he organized according to region and historical (ancient) legends and were about real people or events. The brothers meant it as a scholarly work, but the historical legends were often taken from secondary sources, interpreted, modified, and rewritten—resulting in works \"that were regarded as trademarks\". Some scholars criticized the Grimms' methodology in collecting and rewriting the legends, yet conceptually they set an example for legend collections that was followed by others throughout Europe. Unlike the collection of folk tales, sold poorly, but Zipes says that the collection, translated to French and Danish in the 19th century but not to English until 1981, is a \"vital source for folklorists and critics alike\".\n\nLess well known in the English-speaking world is the Grimms' pioneering scholarly work on a German dictionary, the , which they began in 1838. Not until 1852 did they begin publishing the dictionary in installments. The work on the dictionary was not finished in their lifetimes, because in it they gave a history and analysis of each word.\n\n## Reception and legacy\n\n was not an immediate bestseller, but its popularity grew with each edition. The early editions received lukewarm critical reviews, generally on the basis that the stories did not appeal to children. The brothers responded with modifications and rewrites to increase the book's market appeal to that demographic. By the 1870s the tales had increased greatly in popularity to the point that they were added to the teaching curriculum in Prussia. In the 20th century the work was second only to the Bible as the most popular book in Germany. Its sales generated a mini-industry of critiques, which analyzed the tales' folkloric content in the context of literary history, socialism, and psychological elements often along Freudian and Jungian lines.\n\nIn their research, the brothers made a science of the study of folklore (see folkloristics), generating a model of research that \"launched general fieldwork in most European countries\", and setting standards for research and analysis of stories and legends that made them pioneers in the field of folklore in the 19th century.\n\nIn Nazi Germany the Grimms' stories were used to foster nationalism as well as to promote antisemitic sentiments in an increasingly hostile time for Jewish people. Some examples of notable antisemitic works in the Grimms' bibliography are \"The Girl Who Was Killed by Jews\", \"The Jews' Stone\", \"The Jew Among Thorns\" and \"The Good Bargain\". \"The Girl Who Was Killed by Jews\" and \"The Jews' Stone\" tell stories of blood libel by Jews against innocent children. In both stories the children are violently killed and mutilated. The myth of blood libel was widely propagated during the Middle Ages and is still used to vilify Jews today. The children in these two stories are acquired in exchange for large sums of money; Jewish wealth and greed are also common antisemitic tropes. These tropes appear in \"The Jew Among Thorns\" and \"The Good Bargain\". In both stories a Jewish man is depicted as deceitful for the sake of money. In the former the man admits to stealing money and is executed instead of the protagonist. In the latter, the Jewish man is found to be deceitful in order to be rewarded with a sum of money. The specific deceit is irrelevant and here too the protagonist triumphs over the Jew. All these stories paint Jews as antagonists whether through murderous rites, deceit, or greed. Antisemitism in folklore has contributed to the popularization of antisemitic tropes and misconceptions about the Jewish faith, but the Nazi Party was particularly devoted to the Grimms' collected stories. According to author Elizabeth Dalton, \"Nazi ideologues enshrined the Kinder- und Hausmärchen as virtually a sacred text\". The Nazi Party decreed that every household should own a copy of ; later, officials of Allied-occupied Germany banned the book for a period.\n\nBlood libel tales accused Jews of stealing Christian children to perform religious rituals on them, and most notably, turn their blood into matzah. According to Robert Weinberg, Professor of Jewish History at Swarthmore College, “the accusation that Jews murder Christians, particularly young boys and girls, for ritual purposes has a long and lurid lineage that dates back to the Middle Ages. The accusation of ritual murder emerged in England in the mid-twelfth century with the charge that Jews had killed a Christian youth in order to mock the Passion of Christ. By the middle of the thirteenth century the belief that Jews killed Christians had spread to the European continent, where gentiles now accused Jews of desecrating the Host and using gentile blood for religious purposes, including consuming it in matzo. The concept of cruentation was also extremely prevalent in the Middle Ages. Cruentation described the phenomenon of a corpse spontaneously bleeding in the presence of its murderer. At this time, European Jews were often hunted down and murdered when an Aryan child went missing and stories abounded that the victims, when found, would bleed in the presence of their Jewish killers.\n\nIn the United States the 1937 release of Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs shows the triumph of good over evil, innocence over oppression, according to Zipes. The Grimms' tales have provided much of the early foundation on which Disney built an empire. In film, the Cinderella motif, the story of a poor girl finding love and success, has been repeated in movies such as Pretty Woman, Ever After, Maid in Manhattan, and Ella Enchanted. Not only have the Grimms’ tales provided an empire for Disney to build, but oftentimes, in stories written by the Brothers Grimm, Disney’s villains are depicted as Jewish caricatures. The stepmother in Cinderella is the antagonist of the story and appears Jewish, with a big nose and dark features. Even more blatantly, Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty has devil horns, just as Christians would paint Jews as devils or demons in the Middle Ages. “Images began to portray Jews as hooknosed caricatures of evil” at this time. \n\n20th-century educators debated the value and influence of teaching stories that include brutality and violence, and some of the more gruesome details were sanitized. Dégh writes that some educators, in the belief that children should be shielded from cruelty of any form, believe that stories with a happy ending are fine to teach, whereas those that are darker, particularly the legends, might pose more harm. On the other hand, some educators and psychologists believe that children easily discern the difference between what is a story and what is not and that the tales continue to have value for children. The publication of Bruno Bettelheim's 1976 The Uses of Enchantment brought a new wave of interest in the stories as children's literature, with an emphasis on the \"therapeutic value for children\". More popular stories, such as \"Hansel and Gretel\" and \"Little Red Riding Hood\", have become staples of modern childhood, presented in coloring books, puppet shows, and cartoons. Other stories have been considered too gruesome and have not made a popular transition.\n\nRegardless, the Grimms' stories continue to be popular around the world, although a recent study in England appears to suggest that parents consider the stories overly violent and inappropriate for young children.\n\nNevertheless, children remain enamored of the Grimms' fairy tales with the brothers themselves embraced as the creators of the stories and even as part of the stories themselves. The film The Brothers Grimm imagines them as con artists exploiting superstitious German peasants until they are asked to confront a genuine fairy-tale curse that calls them to finally be heroes. The movie Ever After shows the Grimms in their role as collectors of fairy tales, though they learn to their surprise that at least one of their stories (Cinderella) is true. Grimm follows a detective who discovers that he is a Grimm, the latest in a line of guardians who are sworn to keep the balance between humanity and mythological creatures. Ever After High imagines Grimm Brothers (here called Milton and Giles) as the headmasters of the Ever After High boarding school, where they train the children of the previous generation of fairy tales to follow in their parents' footsteps. In the 10th Kingdom miniseries, the brothers are trapped for years in the fairy-tale world on the 9 Kingdoms, where they witnessed the events that they would record as stories upon finally making it back to the real world. The Sisters Grimm book series follows their descendants, Sabrina and Daphne Grimm, as they adapt to life in Ferryport Landing, a town in upstate New York populated by fairy-tale people. Separate from the previous series is the Land of Stories book series which also features the idea of \"Sisters Grimm.\" In The Land of Stories, the Grimm Brothers' female descendants are a self-described coven determined to track down and document creatures from the fairy-tale world that cross over to the real world. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were, in fact, chosen by Mother Goose and others to tell fairy tales so that they might give hope to the human race.\n\nThe university library at the Humboldt University of Berlin is housed in the Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm Center (); among its collections is a large portion of the Grimms' private library.\n\n## Collaborative works\n\n* , (The Two Oldest German Poems of the Eighth Century: The Song of Hildebrand and Hadubrand and the Wessobrunn Prayer)—ninth century heroic song, published 1812\n\n* (Children's and Household Tales)—seven editions, between 1812 and 1857\n\n* (Old German Forests)—three volumes between 1813 and 1816\n\n* (Poor Heinrich by Hartmann von der Aue)—1815\n\n* (Songs from the Elder Edda)—1815\n\n* (German Sagas)—published in two parts between 1816 and 1818\n\n* —Grimms' translation of Thomas Crofton Croker's Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland, 1826\n\n* (German Dictionary)—32 volumes published between 1852 and 1960\n\n## Popular adaptations\n\nThe below includes adaptations from the work of the Brothers Grimm:\n\n* Avengers Grimm, 2015 American film\n\n* Grimm, 2011 fantasy crime television series about a Grimm descendant\n\n* Once Upon a Time, American television series\n\n* The 10th Kingdom, 2000 American television miniseries\n\n* The Brothers Grimm, 2005 film starring Matt Damon and Heath Ledger\n\n* Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics, 1989 Japanese anime anthology series by Nippon Animation\n\n* The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm, 1962 film starring Lawrence Harvey and Karlheinz Böhm as the Brothers Grimm\n\n* Simsala Grimm, children television series\n\n* A Tale Dark & Grimm, children's book by Adam Gidwitz\n\n* The Family Guy episode entitled \"Grimm Job\" (Season 12, Episode 10), sees the show's characters take on roles in three Grimm Brothers fairy tales: \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", \"Cinderella\", and \"Little Red Riding Hood\".\n\n* The Grimm Variations, 2024 Netflix anime series featuring retellings of six of the Grimm Brothers tales.\n\n## See also\n\n* Grimm Family Tree\n\n* Hans Christian Andersen\n\n* Alexander Afanasyev\n\n* Charles Perrault\n\n* Giambattista Basile\n\n* Norwegian Folktales\n\n* Russian fairy tale\n\n## Further reading\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* Norberg, Jakob.

Missouri voters selected state representatives in all 163 seats of the House of Representatives to serve two-year terms.\n\nThe election coincided with United States national elections and Missouri state elections, including U.S. Senate, U.S. House, Auditor, and Missouri Senate.\nFollowing the previous election in 2020, Republicans held a 114-to-49-seat supermajority over Democrats. There was one special election during the legislative term. Representative Kip Kendrick (D) of District 45 resigned on January 6, 2021. David Tyson Smith (D) won the subsequent special election, holding the seat for his party. Going into election day, there were eight vacancies in the chamber: seven vacancies had been held by Republicans and one vacancy had been a Democratic seat. Therefore, on election day 2022, there were 107 Republicans, 48 Democrats, and eight open seats. Republicans maintained the supermajority in 2022, winning 111 seats. At 52 members, Democrats gained their largest share of House seats since 2012.\n\nThese were the first elections in Missouri following the 2020 United States redistricting cycle, which resulted in redrawn legislative district boundaries.\n\n## Special Election\n\nSources for special election results:\n\n## Closest races\n\nSeats where the margin of victory was under 10%:\n\n## Summary of

{"id": "61563394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz%20Aggiss", "title": "Liz Aggiss", "text": "Liz Aggiss (born 28 May 1953) is a British live artist, dance performer, choreographer and film maker. Her work is inspired by early 20th century Ausdruckstanz (Expressionist dance), in particular the Grotesque dance of Valeska Gert, and by British Music Hall and Variety acts such as the eccentric dance performers, Max Wall and Wilson, Keppel and Betty. She is often described as the 'grand dame of anarchic dance'.\n\nFrom 1982 to 2003, Aggiss collaborated with the composer, writer and choreographer, Billy Cowie, making live shows and films under the name Divas Dance Theatre. After their partnership ended, due to artistic differences, she made a series of films and solo live works, Survival Tactics for the Anarchic Dancer, The English Channel, Slap and Tickle and Crone Alone.\n\nFrom her earliest works, Aggiss has challenged conventional ideas of female sexuality and beauty and questioned 'the social mores that pigeon-hole women of all ages.' She describes her later live shows as a project to 'reclaim the stage space for the older woman.'\n\nAggiss is Emeritus Professor in Visual Performance at the University of Brighton, where she taught for many years, and an Honorary Doctor at the Universities of Gothenburg and Chichester.\n\n## Early years and training\n\nLiz Aggiss was born in Nannygoats Commons, Dagenham, Essex and grew up in nearby Upminster, which she later described as 'a bleak English suburb during post war austerity. Where little children were seen and not heard.' Her love of music hall came from her grandmother, who used to sing to her a whole range of music hall songs: 'These were gifts. Through a kind of memory osmosis I have both fascination and knowledge of music hall....I also have a direct familial lineage to early music hall and performance in my great Auntie Flo aka Marjorie Irvine.'\n\nAggiss's first experience of dance was in 1970, when she studied Rudolph von Laban's modern educational dance in the UK. After a teacher training course in Keele, she 'had various jobs teaching PE teachers how to teach dance.' In 1980, she went to New York to study contemporary dance. After a summer 'studio hopping' from Graham to Cunningham to whatever else she fancied' she found the Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis Dance Theatre Lab, where she felt she belonged. Until 1982, Aggiss trained with the Lab's lead teacher, the German expressionist Hanya Holm, in New York and in Colorado Springs. Back in the UK, Aggiss studied eccentric dance with Joan and Barry Grantham, 'possibly the last remaining living link with the early twentieth century UK Music Hall and Variety world.'\n\nOn her return to the UK in 1982, Aggiss began to teach visual performance at the University of Brighton (then Brighton Polytechnic). Here she met the Scottish composer and writer Billy Cowie, a fellow teacher. They began working together in order to get the student dancers to collaborate with the musicians. 'When the dancers didn't know how to, Liz got up and showed them. Billy directed from the sidelines.' In their book, Anarchic Dance, Aggiss and Cowie described how they worked together: 'All our work is truly collaborative....After the first few productions, whichever of us was feeling most inspired would take up the choreographic baton and run with it until we were floored by the other's barbed, critical and caustic comments. Latterly we pragmatically sliced up the works into manageable chunks and negotiated who would do which aspects of the 'steps' as we like to call them. Strangely the Yin/Yang combination of Aggiss, the 'stand up dancer' who can actually perform the movements, and Cowie the 'armchair choreographer' who can only dream them, works surprisingly well.'\n\n## The Wild Wigglers\n\nIn 1982, Aggiss and Cowie created The Wild Wigglers, a cabaret act inspired by the punk pogo dance, Wilson, Keppel and Betty's Sand Dance and J.H.Stead, the jumping comedian. Three dancers, wearing spiralling yellow and black leotards and tall pointy hats, performed a twenty-minute set of short visually connected dances: 'These simple animated gestures – hopping, jumping, scuttling, rummaging, blobbing, slugging – were grasped and choreographically 'worried to death' in succinct three-minute visual performance wonders'. Two Wild Wiggler dances, Weird Wiggle and Hop on Pops, can be seen on YouTube.\n\nThe Wigglers performed on the Saturday morning television show, No. 73, where they met The Stranglers, who booked them as a support act. This led to appearances in Wembley Arena, Oxford Apollo, Brighton Centre and Zenith Paris. J King in the Morning Star wondered 'whether or not all that hilarious jumping and swaying with feet tied together really qualifies as dance....It was certainly movement of a highly entertaining kind, to be remembered with gratitude by a critic so often threatened with drowning in a sea of self-indulgence, pretentiousness and insipidity.'\n\nThe original Wild Wigglers were Liz Aggiss, Ian Smith and Eva Zambicki. Later members were Jane Bassett, Neil Butler, Billy Cowie, Ralf Higgins, Simon Hedger and Patrick Lee. In 1999, Aggiss, Smith and Butler reunited to perform the act once more in Brighton's Zap club, where the Wigglers originally premiered.\n\n## Grotesque Dancer\n\nIn 1986, Brighton's Zap Arts commissioned Aggiss and Cowie to create a solo piece to be performed in the single arch of the Zap Club. The work Grotesque Dancer was inspired by Aggiss's discovery of Valeska Gert, the most extreme and subversive of the German expressionist dancers. Wearing the uniform of a German gymnast, Aggiss, in a single spotlight, performed a series of short expressionist vignettes accompanied by cabaret-style songs, instrumentals and poems.\n\nGrotesque Dancer provoked strong reactions from audiences and critics. Anne Nugent, in The Stage, wrote that the show presented a 'scenario which disgusted male critics but was greeted with warmth by women writers....Those with a theatre background derived something from it. Those with a dance background did not.' British dance critics, whose background was mostly in ballet, were unaware of the piece's roots in Ausdruckstanz, and described the work as a parody of the film Cabaret or 'a recreation of a Third Reich cabaret'. In Time Out, Alan Robertson wrote, 'Aggiss galumphs around as if she were a transvestite refugee from one of the nightclub routines in Cabaret (presumably she's being awful and gross on purpose).'\n\nOnly the German dance historian Marion Kant recognised the inspiration: 'Liz Aggiss's performance startled me...because so little work has been done to recover grotesque dances and dancers....Yet suddenly...there she was, Liz Aggiss dancing grotesque; dancing Weimar Germany...turning herself into one of those unforgettable, striking images; sharp and penetrating, affronting the senses....There she was as a grotesque dancer reincarnated, offering an eccentric mixture of offence and nonsense.'\n\nAggiss later said that 'the work was about redefining beauty. By the end, the front row of the audience was crying, especially the women.' At one point, she whipped off her wig to reveal a shaven head. 'Amid gasps from the audience, she heard her father shout from the back row: 'Why do you have to make yourself so ugly?\"\n\nThe show was reconstructed at the Purcell Room on London's South Bank, on 9 April 1999, with live musical accompaniment from Cowie (piano) and Gerard McChrystal (saxophone).\n\n## Divas\n\nIn 1986, Aggiss and Cowie created a dance company, Divas, originally all women without formal dance training. Aggiss later said, 'We were always interested in working with performers with personality. In our auditions we interviewed people to find out what they were like. That was what came out on stage. In our first performance, one dancer was pregnant. If you wore glasses normally, you wore them on stage as well.' For dancers, the Divas had what critics described as 'non-standard bodies', causing Aggiss to ask, 'But what is a standard body?'\n\nDivas' first piece wasTorei en Vern Veta Arnold!, which premiered at the Chisenhale Dance Space London on 4 October 1986. In the show, eight dancers, in suits and high heels, used pedestrian, habitual and repetitive gestures. Looking back in 1993, Sophie Constanti described Divas as a 'crew of besuited, stiletto wearing Brighton women, whose otherwise unconventional appearance was intensified by the scowling, hard-edge non-conformity of Aggiss’s brand of movement theatre.' Constanti also reviewed the show at the time: 'Jaunty, hypnotic, silently provocative and defiant, Divas are a refreshing assault on mainstream dance.'\n\nLike Grotesque Dancer, Divas drew a hostile reaction from mainstream dance critics. John Percival in The Times, wrote, 'Liz Aggiss...has thought up a perfectly ripping wheeze of getting five of her chums...to perform in a group called Divas. They have already mastered – no that is too sexist a word for a group of young ladies – they have acquired such advanced performance skills as walking on and off stage.' Mary Clarke in The Guardian described the performers as 'determinedly ugly in dress and in movement...as untrained as they are unattractive.'\n\n## Die Orchidee im Plastik Karton\n\nIn 1988, Aggiss and Cowie created Die Orchidee im Plastik Karton, premiered by 13 dance students at the West Sussex Institute of Higher Education (now University College Chichester), and later performed by Divas, at the Zap in 1989. It took the form of a German language lesson, in which gender-based phrases, spoken by a sampled female voice, revealed sexism in the language and the patriarchal nature of the culture. The phrases included 'InterCity is the train for men,' and 'The orchid in the plastic carton is the flower for ladies' Julia Pascal in her Guardian review wrote that 'Movement is staccato, grotesque and funny. Dann Geht sie Einkaufen – Hausfrau und Mutter (then she goes shopping housewife and mother) is a woman in a crab position walking backwards and forwards on palms and feet; the endless repetitive work action delivered dead pan was answered with female laughs of recognition.'\n\nIn the original student production the dancers wore the white vests and black knickers of school gym classes. In the second production, by Divas, they were dressed in red lederhosen. Parts of Die Orchidee appeared in a 1989 corporate film about Canon photocopiers, co-starring Rik Mayall in green lederhosen. In 1990, the Divas show toured to Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, where a reviewer wrote that 'Liz Aggiss, the post modern primadonna from Brighton puts her finger exactly on the nerve of the spirit of the times with her androgynous show Die Orchidee a send up of the rigid thoroughness of German bourgeois values.' The piece was reconstructed in 1999 at the Purcell Room London, with four male dancers and Aggiss, as school 'mistress', in power suit, stockings and stilettos, carrying a cane.\n\n## Dead Steps\n\nAggiss and Cowie's first commission for another company was Dead Steps, made in 1988 for London's Extemporary Dance Theatre. This was a bridal dance performed, on the front apron of the stage, by seven androgynous brides dressed in slate grey satin, who become 'a nightmare anarchic anti-chorus line.' Allen Robertson in Time Out wrote, \"Your response to the bitter, bizarre bridal dance 'Dead Steps' will depend on your tolerance for deliberately ugly cabaret pastiche with an S&M undercurrent. Alienation and humiliation are Aggiss' watchwords. Clad in metallic floor length gowns with kohl eyes, white faces and mouths like red scars, the dancers perform either in unison distortions or anti-erotic displays of the flesh. It’s a sometimes fascinating, ultimately dissatisfying work, and not nearly as powerful as Aggiss’s solo Grotesque Dancer.\"\n\n## Carousel Dance Company\n\nIn 1989, Aggiss and Cowie began working with the Brighton based Carousel Dance Company (known as High Spin from 1993) in which the majority of performers had learning disabilities. They created Banda Banda, which was performed at the ICA in London in December 1989, and went on to win the 1990 Time Out/Dance Umbrella Award. Annette Stapleton described Banda Banda as 'a challenging, lively, original and entertaining performance.' Aggiss and Cowie created three more shows with the company: La Soupe (1990), The Surgeon's Waltz (2000) and Rice Rain (2001).\n\n## Hilde Holger\n\nFollowing Grotesque Dancer Aggiss was introduced to Hilde Holger, the Viennese expressionist dancer who, then in her 80s, was still teaching dance in a Camden basement. Aggiss studied with Holger until the latter's death in 2001, and later said, 'Meeting her was like coming home.' In 1992, Holger revived four dances for Aggiss from her repertoire: Die Forelle (The Trout) (1923), Le Martyre de San Sebastien (1923), Mechaniches Ballett (1926) and Golem (1937). These were first performed, as Vier Tanze, at the Manchester Festival of Expressionism on 29 February 1992. Sophie Constanti wrote that 'Together all four pieces danced with great sensitivity and aplomb by Aggiss accompanied by Cowie on piano provided a fascinating insight into the lost Ausdruckstanz of central Europe.'\n\nIn July 1992, three days before a sold-out performance of Vier Tanze at the ICA, Aggiss broke her Achilles tendon. Her leg was in plaster for six months, and she was unable to walk properly for a further six. With her leg in plaster, Aggiss performed Cafeteria for a Sit Down Meal, at the Zap on 6 November 1992. Remaining seated throughout, she played the role of 'the world's greatest classical pianist going through his daily dysfunctional functions.' The piece had 'shades of Hilde in the choreographic vocabulary and the make-up.'\n\n## Drool and Drivel They Care!\n\nCommissioned by Zap Arts, Drool and Drivel They Care! (1990) was a satirical portrait of Margaret Thatcher, using phrases, such as 'This government keeps its promises' from her speeches and interviews. The title was from a 1987 interview with David Dimbleby, in which the Prime Minister criticised people who 'just drool and drivel they care.' Aggiss and four dancers, one male, performed as five Thatchers, dressed identically in twin-sets, pearls, handbags and wigs. For Moaning Minnes, two of the Thatchers performed en pointe a choreographed rubbish distribution and collection scheme, inspired by a Thatcher photo opportunity where she picked up litter which had been deliberately scattered before her arrival. The work premiered on 22 November 1990, the very evening Thatcher resigned. The final section was 'swiftly reworked with a wall of Maggies transforming into five John Majors still intoning relentlessly from Thatcher's speeches.' The show was then taken to France, where it was reviewed by Sylvie Sueron: 'Margaret Thatcher is minced up; her gestures, her sayings are deconstructed in self contained sections....Five dancers in strict suits and black stillettos bring to life the authentic stroboscopic qualities of a grating English prime minister.'\n\n## Falling Apart at the Seams\n\nAggiss's 40th birthday in 1993 inspired her first work on the theme of the ageing fleshy body. Commissioned by the Gardner Arts Centre, Falling Apart at the Seams featured a duet for Aggiss and opera singer Naomi Itami. The writer/comedienne Louise Rennison co-directed and the artist Gary Goodman painted cardboard cut-out costumes and set. Billy Cowie provided the poetic text, on topics such as falling apart, dead friends, ageing and babies. Judith Mackrell in The Independent wrote, 'Gaunt faced and neurotic limbed, Aggiss parodies her own long-term fascination with the dark and grotesque. She is a woman afraid of ageing, obsessed with disintegration and pain, while Itami, smooth-skinned, practical and at ease, winds her up with some funny and often painfully personal cracks about her vanity and artistic insecurity.'\n\n## Absurditties\n\nAbsurditties, first performed at the Zap in 1994, was described by Aggiss as 'stand-up dance'. She performed alone on stage without lighting, music or special effects. It was a piece 'about language about the playfulness of words....(comprising) 11 short scenes of grammatical curiosities.' The piece opened with Aggiss, in a silver minidress, saying the word 'my' 79 times in different ways. It was also a comic striptease, in which Aggiss, punning on 'bear' and 'bare', removed a series of pairs of knickers, each time revealing another pair underneath. Deborah Levy wrote that 'Cowie's extremely skilled text works with Aggiss's dynamic performing presence with complete synergy; in fact, Absurditties is a small masterpiece that resonates long after the show has finished.'\n\n## Hi Jinx\n\nIn May 1994, Aggiss won a commissioning award from the Bonnie Bird choreography fund. Aggiss and Cowie used this to create Hi Jinx (1995), a dance lecture performance about Heidi Dzinkowska, an invented choreographer, inspired by Hilde Holger.\n\nThe show comprised Aggiss's live 'reconstructions' and black and white films of dances, in which Lea Anderson played Heidi. Aggiss also read from Dzinkowska's memoir, A Life in Dance ('known as every dancer's bible'), sharing Dzinkowska's 'dance commandments', some of them direct quotations from Hilde Holger\n\nin 2001, Aggiss performed the piece at an academic symposium on the legacy of Tanztheater at the University of Surrey. Philip Beaven, in his report on the symposium, confessed, 'It took me a while to realise that this was a beautifully fabricated parody of our desire to create icons from the past (complete with original film clips from 1904!)'\n\n## Films\n\nAggiss and Cowie began to work in film in 1994, with Beethoven in Love, shown on BBC2, in which Aggiss played a 'granite jawed singer who is both muse and demon, seducer and tormentor to Ludwig Van (Tommy Bayley).' In 2002, they made Motion Control, shown on BBC2, Anarchic Variations which premiered at the Place in London, and Scripted to Within an Inch of Her Life, a live performance and four-screen installation deconstruction of Motion Control, which premiered at Kettles Yard, Cambridge, in 2004.\n\nMotion Control features 'a glammed up Aggiss, fixed to the spot in nameless, enclosed space, and the camera diving and circling around here. The camera lunges at speed towards the centre of her body like a ravenous carnivorous plant, and Aggiss battles against it with all the wiles of a performer....Playing out basic issues of feminist understanding – this woman is limited in movement, trapped in her physical body, a figure of constructed glamour and limitless fascination, but bursting with energy and self-assertion, playing the game as hard and wilfuly as she can.'\n\nAggiss and Cowie's final collaboration was Men in the Wall (2003), a 3D film installation piece which premiered at the ICA. It comprised 'four square holes cut into a wall each containing a man – projected life size or a little bigger – of cutely exaggerated different nationalities. In over-the-top German accent Thomas Kampe rants and rails, munches on a sausage and sweetly sings. Sebastian Gonzales recalls beloved Spanish customs with tension and flair, Anglo-Asian Jeddi Bassan wimpers and pompously prattles while American Scott Smith is casual and crumpled – a soft and sensitive post-beatnik. Changing background scenery places the men in different settings....Affected by the 3D imaging, the wall becomes a fragile, vulnerable mid-space, in which the men are locked between the viewer and the distant background scenery.'\n\n## Anarchic Dance\n\nIn 2006, Routledge published Anarchic Dance, an academic retrospective of Aggiss and Cowie's twenty-five-year collaboration, which they edited with Ian Bramley. It included essays by Aggiss, Cowie, Donald Hutera, Sondra Fraleigh, Sherril Dodds, Claudia Kappenberg, Marion Kant, Valeria A.Briginshaw, Deborah Levy and Carol Brown. The essays discussed Divas' work 'in terms of feminism, hybridity, Expressionism, the \"grotesque\", abstraction and narrative, linguistic play and (addressed) the multiple and playful textures that define it: sound, space, shape, language.' The book also included a DVD of their works.\n\n## Guerilla Dances\n\nAggiss's first solo work following the split with Cowie was Guerilla Dances, performed in 2008-9 at dance festivals. This was a set of 18 short sharp dance 'reconstructions' of European Ausdruckstanz solo performances from between 1917 – 1945. Artists reconstructed included Hilde Holger, Mary Wigman, Valeska Gert, Dore Hoyer, Bronislava Nijinska and Isi-te-Jeu. Some of the dances, such as Hilde Holger's were genuine reconstructions, while others mixed fact with fiction, or were wholly invented. For Mary Wigman's 1920 Lament for the Dead No.2, Aggiss, wearing a long black gown, slowly revolved to reveal her bare buttocks.\n\nAggiss performed Guerilla Dances as pop-up pieces at festivals, including the British Dance Edition Liverpool, Glasgow Merchant City Festival and Loikka Dance Film Festival, Helsinki, Finland. Carrying a megaphone and a beatbox, Aggiss would make a surprise appearance in front of the audience for another dance piece. Jana Návratová, the Czech dance critic, described the impact: 'During the interval or before the performance, when people usually shift in their seats switching off cells and finishing sandwiches, she stepped onto the scene and speaking through a megaphone claimed our attention. As we calmed down, each time more eagerly, she rewarded us with short cartoon sketches from the history of dance....We could see only a few scraps from this treasure but there is no doubt that this Vivienne Westwood of dance is a living jewel of the United Kingdom.'\n\n## Diva and Beach Party Animal\n\nAggiss continued to make films, now working with the filmmaker Joe Murray. Their first film was Diva (2009), in which Aggiss played a jaded diva, performing a reconstruction of a 1927 dance in St Nicholas's churchyard, Brighton. it was shown on Channel 4 in the UK, ArteTV in France and Germany, and ABC in Australia.\n\nIn 2011, Aggiss and Murray made Beach Party Animal, combining footage of real Brighton beach life with staged Guerilla style interventions. Dorothy Max Prior in Total Theatre described the film as 'a very artful and cunning mix of staged set-pieces and real-life action, so deftly edited that unless you are in the know and spot the performers, it is hard to distinguish the plants from the real-live city folk.... in tandem with Joe Murray, she moves away from Expressionism into a crisper and sharper Hyperrealism. Aggiss and Murray apparently spent many, many weeks filming on Brighton beach at all hours of the day and night. Hours and hours of footage are distilled down into a 20-minute film that is an homage to the city that never sleeps (unless it’s face down on a sodden handbag, or comatose and sun-bleached like a beached whale on the pebbles).'\n\nDorothy Max Prior, in a 2017 interview with Aggiss, looked at the connection between her film and live work: 'Whether live or on film, creating moving pictures is at the heart of the work. Big, bold pictures. 'I don’t have an ounce of lyricism in me' she says, explaining why she turned to kohl-eyed, grotesquely-costumed Expressionism at a time (the 1980s) when most other contemporary dancers were dressed in grey sweatpants and exploring Somatic Practice or Contact Improvisation. 'I’ve always hated jumping and rolling on the floor' she says 'I like the jarring, the angular, the distorted...I like to make a stop-frame animation live performance.'\n\n## Survival Tactics\n\nAggiss returned to the stage in 2010 with a full length performance lecture, Survival Tactics, originally called Survival Tactics for the Anarchic Dancer. In 'a refreshingly unabashed 'this is my life' she paid homage to herself and to her factual and fictional mentors, from Max Wall to Marjorie Irvine. The lecture brought together her Guerilla dances with earlier works, including Heidi Djinkowska's dance commandments from Hi Jinx and the 'my my' section of Absurditties. Mary Brennan reviewed a performance at the National Review of Live Art: 'Liz Aggiss wowed us with her Survival Tactics, a bravura volley of agile mischief with ideas and limbs flying in brilliantly ridiculous directions.'\n\nIn a 2018 interview, Aggiss described her motivation for making new stage shows: 'I'd been making a lot of films and then I thought, I want to go back on the stage. I want to be the visible older woman. I want to reclaim the stage space for the older woman.'\n\n## The English Channel\n\nAggiss's next stage show, The English Channel was a reflection on mortality, created in 2013 in response to reaching the age of 60. It opened with Aggiss 'shrouded in a black cape and dancing with a skull perched atop her head....The skull, cradled like a baby and placed gently onstage, becomes witness to everything that follows.'\n\nAs the English Channel, Aggiss presented herself as a medium 'conjuring the ghosts of dance past, present and future, who all remind us that death is just around the corner.' The ghosts summoned were Kurt Jooss, Robin Hood and his Merry Men, Claire Waldoff, Gertrude Ederle, Florence Foster Jenkins, Kay Lynn, Max Miller, Max Wall, Lily Morris and Isi Te Jeu. \n\nAggiss's live performance was framed by Joe Murray's archive and contemporary films, in which Lisa Wolfe impersonated Claire Waldoff, Emma Kilbey performed as Florence Foster Jenkins and Antonia Gove danced as Isi Te Jeu. The score by Alan Boorman of Wevie, wove 'together his own quirky compositions with a whole raft of found sound, classical piano...and pop classics.' There were live musical numbers, in which Aggiss reframed 'The Dead Kennedys' best-known song into a jazzy number about rolling into bed too tired to copulate, and another about the pleasures of the female orgasm.' At the end, the whole audience was invited onstage for 'a jolly Essex knees up'.\n\nIn her review, Dorothy Max Prior described the show as 'a marriage of choreography and scenography. Live art. Moving sculpture....Clothing isn’t merely decorative, it changes the body’s movement, it informs the choreography. Often, the performer’s body is deconstructed or distorted or extended by what she is wearing: a black penitent’s shroud covers her head, but exposes her legs, making her look like a mini-skirted Ku Klux Klan member; an enormous metal claw with excessively long fingers weaves through the air, both menacing and mesmeric (referencing Kay Lynn’s Finger Dance); her Max Wall bulging bottom channels the Bouffon, looking down at the world and laughing. At times, she seems to be almost puppeteering herself in a complex animation of body and object or clothing.' The costumes were made by Holly Murray, who has worked on every Aggiss show since 2000.\n\nAggiss toured widely with The English Channel, performing around Britain and also in Ireland, Sweden, France, Spain, Germany, Russia, China and Tasmania.\n\n## Slap and Tickle\n\nAggiss followed The English Channel in 2016 with Slap and Tickle, a dark and disturbing piece on the forces that shape and constrain female lives, from childhood to old age. In an interview she described it as 'a show of opposites; slap and tickle, punishment reward, push and pull' Aggiss alternately 'slapped' the audience, taking them into dark areas, and then 'tickled' them with comic material ('Come on everybody! Let’s have a party!')\n\nSlap and Tickle was structured in three acts, 'using a visual and aural collage of movement, text, props, costumes (Holly Murray), sound (Joe Murray) and cover versions (Alan Boorman/Wevie)'. The first act explored the world of the girl-child and 'the insidious nature of the fairy tales and nursery rhymes than reify societal mores'. Referencing Cinderella, Aggiss wore silver slippers and a gorgeous old-gold party dress.' The second act, on the adult woman, began with her wearing 'a chic New Vogue black-and-white dress, striking high fashion poses' and ended with 'a genuinely disturbing turn with a misshapen puppet, which Aggiss dangles from a noose over her shoulder as she describes the journey of a woman who experiences pregnancy, abortion, childbirth and bad motherhood.' The third act, on the older woman, ended with her 'crawling on all fours to 'Smack My Bitch Up', bare-arsed with a pony tail waving over her bum, a faint sly smile playing over her lips.'. Dorothy Max Prior described the ending as 'a fabulous moment of emancipation and celebration of the older female body.'\n\nThe three parts were interspersed with audience games of pass-the-parcel and balloon twisting, overseen by the voice of a 1950s BBC Listen with Mother radio announcer, voiced by Emma Kilbey.\n\nLaura Irvine called Slap and Tickle 'a wilfully raucous, often unnerving meditation on the reductive labels that limit the development and growth of girls. It’s also an impassioned plea for visibility, a space for recognising the sexuality and agency of older women.'. Mary Brennan described it as a 'glorious broadside against the social mores that pigeon-hole women of all ages....The hilarious tickle never undermines the serious slap in this solo.'. For Lyn Gardner, the show was a 'pointed and bawdily funny exploration of what it means to refuse to act your age' Sarah Kent argued that the piece was 'more personal, more pertinent and far more potent' than The English Channel.\n\nSlap and Tickle toured internationally, and won the 2017 Total Theatre award at the Edinburgh Fringe.\n\n## Crone Alone\n\nIn 2019, Aggiss began to develop a new solo stage show, Crone Alone, which she originally planned as 'a layered, unapologetic feminist solo that dissects the historical medical precedents, associated with female hysteria. Symptoms included: ‘wandering wombs’; a ‘tendency to cause trouble’; a ‘gathering in the head’; ‘egotism’ and ‘novel reading’.' \n\nDue to the Covid 19 pandemic, the project was delayed until 2022. On her website, Aggiss said that she had now 'decided to reinvent herself as a performance poet whilst embracing her inner crone as the ideal incarnation of herself, unruly, wise, fearsome, and just a bit gobby.'\n\nThe first showing of the work in progress was on 17 June 2022, opening Sadler's Wells Elixir Festival, a season of performances 'celebrating the artistry of the older dancer.' In SeeingDance, Matthew Paluch wrote: 'Aggiss offers spoken word verging on rap, balletic interludes and jerky movement phrases, all encompassed within a very long, drawn-out strip tease of sorts. She ends up in a blonde wig à la Marie-Antoinette via Uranus, and a flesh-tone leotard with (artificial) nipples, pubic hair and labia on display. You can’t take your eyes off her though. She’s charismatic to the point of perplexing....Her genius is herself though. What she offers is so genuine. Her show could work anywhere as she is the show. She seemed to be sharing her perception of the way she’s been, or is being, perceived. It felt personal, purposeful and profound.'\n\nSanjoy Roy in the Guardian wrote: 'Opening its first evening was Liz Aggiss, dubbed the “enfant terrible of the bus pass generation” in the programme note, whose inimitable presence – equal parts Weimar cabaret host, dada dancer, rogue feminist and end-of-pier prankster – feels as fresh now as it did when she started out four decades ago. Her short solo Crone Alone is, as she repeatedly points out during the performance, definitely and defiantly not pretty. She peels off her coat – a kind of shiny all-body bin-bag – to reveal a scuzzy vest and bulging Y-fronts. She peels those off too, revealing successive layers of vests and undies that release various abject objects....In between, she recalls critical reactions to her early shows, cranks her limbs into puppetty jerks, rants and raps to club and rock rhythms, air-guitars her fingers in front of her crotch. Peel away your lifelong accretions of self and society, she seems to say, and you find fights and philosophising, you find odours, body hair and saggy skin, and you find a hot, sweaty soul that is not pretty, but is punchy – and a force of life.'\n\n## Commissions\n\nAlongside her own shows, Aggiss has written, choreographed and directed work for other companies. In 2008, she made Don't Put Your Daughter on the Stage for MapDance, the University of Chichester's student company. It featured a chorus line-up of dancers and paid 'homage to early twentieth-century dance in its styling and aesthetic...maintaining the syncopation of a classic showgirl line-up.'\n\nAggiss's second work for MapDance, Cut with the Kitchen Knife (2014), referenced the photomontages of Hannah Höch, the stop frame animations of Edweard Muybridge, Gertrud Bodenwieser's Demon Machine, and the 1933 Hollywood musical Roman Scandals. Aggiss described the show: 'A troupe of oddball performers is hell-bent on recovering bodies from the library....This performance pays homage to past dance artists of the past, drags them into the present and reflects on the challenges still facing contemporary dance audiences.'\n\nIn 2016, Aggiss made a third show for MapDance, History Repeating..., which reconstructed Bounce Dance from Grotesque Dancer, Hilde Holger's Die Forelle (The Trout) and Wilson Keppel and Betty's Sand Dance.\n\nFor Nora Invites (Eleanor Sikorski and Flora Wellesley Wesley), in 2014, Aggiss created Bloody Nora! which Sarah Veale described as 'a smart and searing send-up of the infuriating 'Is it that time of the month?' questions so often levied at women who dare express an impassioned opinion.'\n\nHead in My Bag (2019) was a commission for Dance Six-O, the elder performance company. It was a piece which 'dumps age centre stage and kicks preconceptions into the long grass....Her performers, with handbags on their heads, become a radical army of spirited individuals calling for the overturn of institutional myopia.'\n\nMADE TO LAST (2019), another commission for older dancers, was created for the Mature Artists Dance Experience (MADE) of Hobart, Tasmania. Reviewing the first performance, Lesley Graham wrote, \"Flossing and farting along with mysteriously moving curtains are par for the course. As the performers taunt: ‘We are watching you watching us, so watch out!’....Seriously funny, and verging on anarchic, this work shows that growing older doesn’t have to be graceful, and is an extension of lives being well lived.\" The show, postponed for four years due to Covid, was restaged by Aggiss at the Theatre Royal Tasmania in 2023.\n\n## Teaching\n\nFrom 1982 to 2000, Aggiss taught visual performance at the University of Brighton.

{"id": "152611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular%20differentiation", "title": "Cellular differentiation", "text": "Cellular differentiation is the process in which a stem cell changes from one type to a differentiated one. Usually, the cell changes to a more specialized type. Differentiation happens multiple times during the development of a multicellular organism as it changes from a simple zygote to a complex system of tissues and cell types. Differentiation continues in adulthood as adult stem cells divide and create fully differentiated daughter cells during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover. Some differentiation occurs in response to antigen exposure. Differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals. These changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression and are the study of epigenetics. With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself. Metabolic composition, however, gets dramatically altered where stem cells are characterized by abundant metabolites with highly unsaturated structures whose levels decrease upon differentiation. Thus, different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome.\n\nA specialized type of differentiation, known as terminal differentiation, is of importance in some tissues, including vertebrate nervous system, striated muscle, epidermis and gut. During terminal differentiation, a precursor cell formerly capable of cell division permanently leaves the cell cycle, dismantles the cell cycle machinery and often expresses a range of genes characteristic of the cell's final function (e.g. myosin and actin for a muscle cell). Differentiation may continue to occur after terminal differentiation if the capacity and functions of the cell undergo further changes.\n\nAmong dividing cells, there are multiple levels of cell potency, which is the cell's ability to differentiate into other cell types. A greater potency indicates a larger number of cell types that can be derived. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types, including the placental tissue, is known as totipotent. In mammals, only the zygote and subsequent blastomeres are totipotent, while in plants, many differentiated cells can become totipotent with simple laboratory techniques. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types of the adult organism is known as pluripotent. Such cells are called meristematic cells in higher plants and embryonic stem cells in animals, though some groups report the presence of adult pluripotent cells. Virally induced expression of four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, , and Klf4 (Yamanaka factors) is sufficient to create pluripotent (iPS) cells from adult fibroblasts. A multipotent cell is one that can differentiate into multiple different, but closely related cell types. Oligopotent cells are more restricted than multipotent, but can still differentiate into a few closely related cell types. Finally, unipotent cells can differentiate into only one cell type, but are capable of self-renewal. In cytopathology, the level of cellular differentiation is used as a measure of cancer progression. \"Grade\" is a marker of how differentiated a cell in a tumor is.\n\n## Mammalian cell types\n\nThree basic categories of cells make up the mammalian body: germ cells, somatic cells, and stem cells. Each of the approximately 37.2 trillion (3.72x1013) cells in an adult human has its own copy or copies of the genome except certain cell types, such as red blood cells, that lack nuclei in their fully differentiated state. Most cells are diploid; they have two copies of each chromosome. Such cells, called somatic cells, make up most of the human body, such as skin and muscle cells. Cells differentiate to specialize for different functions.\n\nGerm line cells are any line of cells that give rise to gametes—eggs and sperm—and thus are continuous through the generations. Stem cells, on the other hand, have the ability to divide for indefinite periods and to give rise to specialized cells. They are best described in the context of normal human development.\n \nDevelopment begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg and creates a single cell that has the potential to form an entire organism. In the first hours after fertilization, this cell divides into identical cells. In humans, approximately four days after fertilization and after several cycles of cell division, these cells begin to specialize, forming a hollow sphere of cells, called a blastocyst. The blastocyst has an outer layer of cells, and inside this hollow sphere, there is a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass. The cells of the inner cell mass go on to form virtually all of the tissues of the human body. Although the cells of the inner cell mass can form virtually every type of cell found in the human body, they cannot form an organism. These cells are referred to as pluripotent.\n\nPluripotent stem cells undergo further specialization into multipotent progenitor cells that then give rise to functional cells. Examples of stem and progenitor cells include:\n\n* Radial glial cells (embryonic neural stem cells) that give rise to excitatory neurons in the fetal brain through the process of neurogenesis.\n\n* Hematopoietic stem cells (adult stem cells) from the bone marrow that give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\n* Mesenchymal stem cells (adult stem cells) from the bone marrow that give rise to stromal cells, fat cells, and types of bone cells\n\n* Epithelial stem cells (progenitor cells) that give rise to the various types of skin cells\n\n* Muscle satellite cells (progenitor cells) that contribute to differentiated muscle tissue.\nA pathway that is guided by the cell adhesion molecules consisting of four amino acids, arginine, glycine, asparagine, and serine, is created as the cellular blastomere differentiates from the single-layered blastula to the three primary layers of germ cells in mammals, namely the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm (listed from most distal (exterior) to proximal (interior)). The ectoderm ends up forming the skin and the nervous system, the mesoderm forms the bones and muscular tissue, and the endoderm forms the internal organ tissues.\n\n## Dedifferentiation\n\nDedifferentiation, or integration, is a cellular process seen in the more basal life forms in animals, such as worms and amphibians where a differentiated cell reverts to an earlier developmental stageusually as part of a regenerative process. Dedifferentiation also occurs in plant cells. And, in cell culture in the laboratory, cells can change shape or may lose specific properties such as protein expressionwhich processes are also termed dedifferentiation.\n\nSome hypothesize that dedifferentiation is an aberration that likely results in cancers, but others explain it as a natural part of the immune response that was lost to humans at some point of evolution.\n\nA newly discovered molecule dubbed reversine, a purine analog, has proven to induce dedifferentiation in myotubes. These manifestly dedifferentiated cellsnow performing essentially as stem cellscould then redifferentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes.\n\n## Mechanisms\n\nEach specialized cell type in an organism expresses a subset of all the genes that constitute the genome of that species. Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network. A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network. The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns (morphogenesis). However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on stochastic gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause.\n\nWhile evolutionarily conserved molecular processes are involved in the cellular mechanisms underlying these switches, in animal species these are very different from the well-characterized gene regulatory mechanisms of bacteria, and even from those of the animals' closest unicellular relatives. Specifically, cell differentiation in animals is highly dependent on biomolecular condensates of regulatory proteins and enhancer DNA sequences.\n\nCellular differentiation is often controlled by cell signaling. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called growth factors. Although the details of specific signal transduction pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps. A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor. The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity. The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them. A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell. Cells and tissues can vary in competence, their ability to respond to external signals.\n\nSignal induction refers to cascades of signaling events, during which a cell or tissue signals to another cell or tissue to influence its developmental fate. Yamamoto and Jeffery investigated the role of the lens in eye formation in cave- and surface-dwelling fish, a striking example of induction. Through reciprocal transplants, Yamamoto and Jeffery found that the lens vesicle of surface fish can induce other parts of the eye to develop in cave- and surface-dwelling fish, while the lens vesicle of the cave-dwelling fish cannot.\n\nOther important mechanisms fall under the category of asymmetric cell divisions, divisions that give rise to daughter cells with distinct developmental fates. Asymmetric cell divisions can occur because of asymmetrically expressed maternal cytoplasmic determinants or because of signaling. In the former mechanism, distinct daughter cells are created during cytokinesis because of an uneven distribution of regulatory molecules in the parent cell; the distinct cytoplasm that each daughter cell inherits results in a distinct pattern of differentiation for each daughter cell. A well-studied example of pattern formation by asymmetric divisions is body axis patterning in Drosophila. RNA molecules are an important type of intracellular differentiation control signal. The molecular and genetic basis of asymmetric cell divisions has also been studied in green algae of the genus Volvox, a model system for studying how unicellular organisms can evolve into multicellular organisms. In Volvox carteri, the 16 cells in the anterior hemisphere of a 32-cell embryo divide asymmetrically, each producing one large and one small daughter cell. The size of the cell at the end of all cell divisions determines whether it becomes a specialized germ or somatic cell.\n\n## Epigenetic control\n\nSince each cell, regardless of cell type, possesses the same genome, determination of cell type must occur at the level of gene expression. While the regulation of gene expression can occur through cis- and trans-regulatory elements including a gene's promoter and enhancers, the problem arises as to how this expression pattern is maintained over numerous generations of cell division. As it turns out, epigenetic processes play a crucial role in regulating the decision to adopt a stem, progenitor, or mature cell fate This section will focus primarily on mammalian stem cells.\n\nIn systems biology and mathematical modeling of gene regulatory networks, cell-fate determination is predicted to exhibit certain dynamics, such as attractor-convergence (the attractor can be an equilibrium point, limit cycle or strange attractor) or oscillatory.\n\n## Importance of epigenetic control\n\nThe first question that can be asked is the extent and complexity of the role of epigenetic processes in the determination of cell fate. A clear answer to this question can be seen in the 2011 paper by Lister R, et al. on aberrant epigenomic programming in human induced pluripotent stem cells. As induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are thought to mimic embryonic stem cells in their pluripotent properties, few epigenetic differences should exist between them. To test this prediction, the authors conducted whole-genome profiling of DNA methylation patterns in several human embryonic stem cell (ESC), iPSC, and progenitor cell lines.\n\nFemale adipose cells, lung fibroblasts, and foreskin fibroblasts were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent state with the OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC genes. Patterns of DNA methylation in ESCs, iPSCs, somatic cells were compared. Lister R, et al. observed significant resemblance in methylation levels between embryonic and induced pluripotent cells. Around 80% of CG dinucleotides in ESCs and iPSCs were methylated, the same was true of only 60% of CG dinucleotides in somatic cells. In addition, somatic cells possessed minimal levels of cytosine methylation in non-CG dinucleotides, while induced pluripotent cells possessed similar levels of methylation as embryonic stem cells, between 0.5 and 1.5%. Thus, consistent with their respective transcriptional activities, DNA methylation patterns, at least on the genomic level, are similar between ESCs and iPSCs.\n\nHowever, upon examining methylation patterns more closely, the authors discovered 1175 regions of differential CG dinucleotide methylation between at least one ES or iPS cell line. By comparing these regions of differential methylation with regions of cytosine methylation in the original somatic cells, 44-49% of differentially methylated regions reflected methylation patterns of the respective progenitor somatic cells, while 51-56% of these regions were dissimilar to both the progenitor and embryonic cell lines. In vitro-induced differentiation of iPSC lines saw transmission of 88% and 46% of hyper and hypo-methylated differentially methylated regions, respectively.\n\nTwo conclusions are readily apparent from this study. First, epigenetic processes are heavily involved in cell fate determination, as seen from the similar levels of cytosine methylation between induced pluripotent and embryonic stem cells, consistent with their respective patterns of transcription. Second, the mechanisms of reprogramming (and by extension, differentiation) are very complex and cannot be easily duplicated, as seen by the significant number of differentially methylated regions between ES and iPS cell lines. Now that these two points have been established, we can examine some of the epigenetic mechanisms that are thought to regulate cellular differentiation.\n\n## Pioneer factors (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog)\n\nThree transcription factors, OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG – the first two of which are used in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming, along with Klf4 and c-Myc – are highly expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and are necessary for the maintenance of their pluripotency. It is thought that they achieve this through alterations in chromatin structure, such as histone modification and DNA methylation, to restrict or permit the transcription of target genes. While highly expressed, their levels require a precise balance to maintain pluripotency, perturbation of which will promote differentiation towards different lineages based on how the gene expression levels change. Differential regulation of Oct-4 and SOX2 levels have been shown to precede germ layer fate selection. Increased levels of Oct4 and decreased levels of Sox2 promote a mesendodermal fate, with Oct4 actively suppressing genes associated with a neural ectodermal fate. Similarly, increased levels of Sox2 and decreased levels of Oct4 promote differentiation towards a neural ectodermal fate, with Sox2 inhibiting differentiation towards a mesendodermal fate. Regardless of the lineage cells differentiate down, suppression of NANOG has been identified as a necessary prerequisite for differentiation.\n\n## Polycomb repressive complex (PRC2)\n\nIn the realm of gene silencing, Polycomb repressive complex 2, one of two classes of the Polycomb group (PcG) family of proteins, catalyzes the di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me2/me3). By binding to the H3K27me2/3-tagged nucleosome, PRC1 (also a complex of PcG family proteins) catalyzes the mono-ubiquitinylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub1), blocking RNA polymerase II activity and resulting in transcriptional suppression. PcG knockout ES cells do not differentiate efficiently into the three germ layers, and deletion of the PRC1 and PRC2 genes leads to increased expression of lineage-affiliated genes and unscheduled differentiation. Presumably, PcG complexes are responsible for transcriptionally repressing differentiation and development-promoting genes.\n\n## Trithorax group proteins (TrxG)\n\nAlternately, upon receiving differentiation signals, PcG proteins are recruited to promoters of pluripotency transcription factors. PcG-deficient ES cells can begin differentiation but cannot maintain the differentiated phenotype. Simultaneously, differentiation and development-promoting genes are activated by Trithorax group (TrxG) chromatin regulators and lose their repression. TrxG proteins are recruited at regions of high transcriptional activity, where they catalyze the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and promote gene activation through histone acetylation. PcG and TrxG complexes engage in direct competition and are thought to be functionally antagonistic, creating at differentiation and development-promoting loci what is termed a \"bivalent domain\" and rendering these genes sensitive to rapid induction or repression.\n\n## DNA methylation\n\nRegulation of gene expression is further achieved through DNA methylation, in which the DNA methyltransferase-mediated methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides maintains heritable repression by controlling DNA accessibility. The majority of CpG sites in embryonic stem cells are unmethylated and appear to be associated with H3K4me3-carrying nucleosomes. Upon differentiation, a small number of genes, including OCT4 and NANOG, are methylated and their promoters repressed to prevent their further expression. Consistently, DNA methylation-deficient embryonic stem cells rapidly enter apoptosis upon in vitro differentiation.\n\n## Nucleosome positioning\n\nWhile the DNA sequence of most cells of an organism is the same, the binding patterns of transcription factors and the corresponding gene expression patterns are different. To a large extent, differences in transcription factor binding are determined by the chromatin accessibility of their binding sites through histone modification and/or pioneer factors. In particular, it is important to know whether a nucleosome is covering a given genomic binding site or not. This can be determined using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.\n\n## Histone acetylation and methylation\n\nDNA-nucleosome interactions are characterized by two states: either tightly bound by nucleosomes and transcriptionally inactive, called heterochromatin, or loosely bound and usually, but not always, transcriptionally active, called euchromatin. The epigenetic processes of histone methylation and acetylation, and their inverses demethylation and deacetylation primarily account for these changes. The effects of acetylation and deacetylation are more predictable. An acetyl group is either added to or removed from the positively charged Lysine residues in histones by enzymes called histone acetyltransferases or histone deactylases, respectively. The acetyl group prevents Lysine's association with the negatively charged DNA backbone. Methylation is not as straightforward, as neither methylation nor demethylation consistently correlate with either gene activation or repression. However, certain methylations have been repeatedly shown to either activate or repress genes. The trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4Me3) is associated with gene activation, whereas trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 represses genes\n\n## In stem cells\n\nDuring differentiation, stem cells change their gene expression profiles. Recent studies have implicated a role for nucleosome positioning and histone modifications during this process. There are two components of this process: turning off the expression of embryonic stem cell (ESC) genes, and the activation of cell fate genes. Lysine specific demethylase 1 (KDM1A) is thought to prevent the use of enhancer regions of pluripotency genes, thereby inhibiting their transcription. It interacts with Mi-2/NuRD complex (nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylase) complex, giving an instance where methylation and acetylation are not discrete and mutually exclusive, but intertwined processes.\n\n## Role of signaling in epigenetic control\n\nA final question to ask concerns the role of cell signaling in influencing the epigenetic processes governing differentiation. Such a role should exist, as it would be reasonable to think that extrinsic signaling can lead to epigenetic remodeling, just as it can lead to changes in gene expression through the activation or repression of different transcription factors. Little direct data is available concerning the specific signals that influence the epigenome, and the majority of current knowledge about the subject consists of speculations on plausible candidate regulators of epigenetic remodeling. We will first discuss several major candidates thought to be involved in the induction and maintenance of both embryonic stem cells and their differentiated progeny, and then turn to one example of specific signaling pathways in which more direct evidence exists for its role in epigenetic change.\n\nThe first major candidate is Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt pathway is involved in all stages of differentiation, and the ligand Wnt3a can substitute for the overexpression of c-Myc in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. On the other hand, disruption of β-catenin, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, leads to decreased proliferation of neural progenitors.\n\nGrowth factors comprise the second major set of candidates of epigenetic regulators of cellular differentiation. These morphogens are crucial for development, and include bone morphogenetic proteins, transforming growth factors (TGFs), and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). TGFs and FGFs have been shown to sustain expression of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG by downstream signaling to Smad proteins. Depletion of growth factors promotes the differentiation of ESCs, while genes with bivalent chromatin can become either more restrictive or permissive in their transcription.\n\nSeveral other signaling pathways are also considered to be primary candidates. Cytokine leukemia inhibitory factors are associated with the maintenance of mouse ESCs in an undifferentiated state. This is achieved through its activation of the Jak-STAT3 pathway, which has been shown to be necessary and sufficient towards maintaining mouse ESC pluripotency. Retinoic acid can induce differentiation of human and mouse ESCs, and Notch signaling is involved in the proliferation and self-renewal of stem cells. Finally, Sonic hedgehog, in addition to its role as a morphogen, promotes embryonic stem cell differentiation and the self-renewal of somatic stem cells.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that the candidacy of these signaling pathways was inferred primarily on the basis of their role in development and cellular differentiation. While epigenetic regulation is necessary for driving cellular differentiation, they are certainly not sufficient for this process. Direct modulation of gene expression through modification of transcription factors plays a key role that must be distinguished from heritable epigenetic changes that can persist even in the absence of the original environmental signals. Only a few examples of signaling pathways leading to epigenetic changes that alter cell fate currently exist, and we will focus on one of them.\n\nExpression of Shh (Sonic hedgehog) upregulates the production of BMI1, a component of the PcG complex that recognizes H3K27me3. This occurs in a Gli-dependent manner, as Gli1 and Gli2 are downstream effectors of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. In culture, Bmi1 mediates the Hedgehog pathway's ability to promote human mammary stem cell self-renewal. In both humans and mice, researchers showed Bmi1 to be highly expressed in proliferating immature cerebellar granule cell precursors. When Bmi1 was knocked out in mice, impaired cerebellar development resulted, leading to significant reductions in postnatal brain mass along with abnormalities in motor control and behavior. A separate study showed a significant decrease in neural stem cell proliferation along with increased astrocyte proliferation in Bmi null mice.\n\nAn alternative model of cellular differentiation during embryogenesis is that positional information is based on mechanical signalling by the cytoskeleton using Embryonic differentiation waves. The mechanical signal is then epigenetically transduced via signal transduction systems (of which specific molecules such as Wnt are part) to result in differential gene expression.\n\nIn summary, the role of signaling in the epigenetic control of cell fate in mammals is largely unknown, but distinct examples exist that indicate the likely existence of further such mechanisms.\n\n## Effect of matrix elasticity\n\nIn order to fulfill the purpose of regenerating a variety of tissues, adult stems are known to migrate from their niches, adhere to new extracellular matrices (ECM) and differentiate. The ductility of these microenvironments are unique to different tissue types. The ECM surrounding brain, muscle and bone tissues range from soft to stiff. The transduction of the stem cells into these cells types is not directed solely by chemokine cues and cell to cell signaling. The elasticity of the microenvironment can also affect the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs which originate in bone marrow.) When MSCs are placed on substrates of the same stiffness as brain, muscle and bone ECM, the MSCs take on properties of those respective cell types.\nMatrix sensing requires the cell to pull against the matrix at focal adhesions, which triggers a cellular mechano-transducer to generate a signal to be informed what force is needed to deform the matrix. To determine the key players in matrix-elasticity-driven lineage specification in MSCs, different matrix microenvironments were mimicked. From these experiments, it was concluded that focal adhesions of the MSCs were the cellular mechano-transducer sensing the differences of the matrix elasticity. The non-muscle myosin IIa-c isoforms generates the forces in the cell that lead to signaling of early commitment markers. Nonmuscle myosin IIa generates the least force increasing to non-muscle myosin IIc. There are also factors in the cell that inhibit non-muscle myosin II, such as blebbistatin. This makes the cell effectively blind to the surrounding matrix. Researchers have achieved some success in inducing stem cell-like properties in HEK 239 cells by providing a soft matrix without the use of diffusing factors. The stem-cell properties appear to be linked to tension in the cells' actin network. One identified mechanism for matrix-induced differentiation is tension-induced proteins, which remodel chromatin in response to mechanical stretch. The RhoA pathway is also implicated in this process.\n\n## Evolutionary history\n\nA billion-years-old, likely holozoan, protist, Bicellum brasieri with two types of cells, shows that the evolution of differentiated multicellularity, possibly but not necessarily of animal lineages, occurred at least 1 billion years ago and possibly mainly in freshwater lakes rather than the ocean.\n\n## See also\n\n* Interbilayer Forces in Membrane Fusion\n\n* Fusion mechanism\n\n* Lipid bilayer fusion\n\n* Cell-cell fusogens\n\n* CAF-1\n\n* List of human cell types derived from the germ layers\n\n## References\n\nCellular processes\nDevelopmental biology\nInduced stem cells"}

{"id": "20556975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English%20Canadians", "title": "English Canadians", "text": "English Canadians (), or Anglo-Canadians (), refers to either Canadians of English ethnic origin and heritage or to English-speaking or Anglophone Canadians of any ethnic origin; it is used primarily in contrast with French Canadians. Canada is an officially bilingual country, with English and French official language communities. Immigrant cultural groups ostensibly integrate into one or both of these communities, but often retain elements of their original cultures. The term English-speaking Canadian is sometimes used interchangeably with English Canadian.\n\nAlthough many English-speaking Canadians have strong historical roots traceable to England or other parts of the British Isles, English-speaking Canadians have a variety of ethnic backgrounds. They or their ancestors came from various Celtic, European, Asian, Caribbean, African, Latin American, and Pacific Island cultures, as well as French Canada and North American Aboriginal groups.\n\nIn addition to the terms \"English Canadian\" and \"Canadian\", the terms \"Anglophone Canadian\" and \"Anglo-Canadian\" are also used. An additional 11,135,965 Canadians describe their ethnic background as \"Canadian\", many of whom may also be of English ancestry.\n\nCategorically as an ethnic group, English Canadians comprise a subgroup of British Canadians which is a further subgroup of European Canadians.\n\n## Newfoundland (and Labrador)\n\nEnglish Canadian history starts with the attempts to establish English settlements in Newfoundland in the sixteenth century. The first English settlement in present-day Canada was at St. Johns Newfoundland, in 1583. Newfoundland's population was significantly influenced by Irish and English immigration, much of it as a result of the migratory fishery in the decades prior to the Great Famine of Ireland. Although the location of the earliest English settlement in what would eventually become Canada, Newfoundland itself (now called Newfoundland and Labrador) was the last province to enter Confederation in 1949.\n\n## Nova Scotia\n\nThe area that forms the present day province of Nova Scotia was contested by the British and French in the eighteenth century. French settlements at Port Royal (Annapolis Royal), Louisbourg and what is now Prince Edward Island were seized by the British. After the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht ceded the French colony of Acadia (today's mainland Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) to Great Britain, efforts to colonize the province were limited to small settlements in Canso and Annapolis Royal. In 1749, Colonel Edward Cornwallis was given command of an expedition for the settlement of Chebucto by some three thousand persons, many of whom were Cockney. Cornwallis' settlement, Halifax, would become the provincial capital, the primary commercial centre for the Maritime provinces, a strategic British military and naval outpost and an important east coast cultural centre. To offset the Catholic presence of Acadians, foreign Protestants (mainly German) were given land and founded Lunenburg. Nova Scotia itself saw considerable immigration from Scotland, particularly to communities such as Pictou in the northern part of the province and to Cape Breton Island, but this began only with the arrival of the Hector in 1773.\n\n## Loyalists: New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario\n\nThe history of English Canadians is bound to the history of English settlement of North America, and particularly New England, because of the resettlement of many Loyalists following the American Revolution in areas that would form part of Canada. Many of the fifty thousand Loyalists who were resettled to the north of the United States after 1783 came from families that had already been settled for several generations in North America and were from prominent families in Boston, New York and other east coast towns. Although largely of British ancestry, these settlers had also intermarried with Huguenot and Dutch colonists and were accompanied by Loyalists of African descent. Dispossessed of their property at the end of the Revolutionary War, the Loyalists arrived as refugees to settle primarily along the shores of southern Nova Scotia, the Bay of Fundy and the Saint John River and in Quebec to the east and southwest of Montreal.\n\nThe colony of New Brunswick was created from western part of Nova Scotia at the instigation of these new English-speaking settlers. The Loyalist settlements in southwestern Quebec formed the nucleus of what would become the province of Upper Canada and, after 1867, Ontario.\n\n## Ontario\n\nUpper Canada was a primary destination for English, Scottish and Scots-Irish settlers to Canada in the nineteenth century, and was on the front lines in the War of 1812 between the British Empire and the United States. The province also received immigrants from non English-speaking sources such as Germans, many of whom settled around Kitchener (formerly called Berlin). Ontario became the most populous province in the Dominion of Canada at the time of Confederation, and, together with Montreal, formed the country's industrial heartland and emerged as an important cultural and media centre for English Canada. Toronto is today the largest city in Canada, and, largely as a result of changing immigration patterns since the 1960s, is also one of the most multi-cultural cities in the world.\n\n## Quebec\n\nAfter the fall of New France to the British in 1759, a colonial governing class established itself in Quebec City. Larger numbers of English-speaking settlers arrived in the Eastern Townships and Montreal after the American Revolution. English, Scottish, and Irish communities established themselves in Montreal in the 1800s. Montreal became Canada's largest city and commercial hub in Canada. An Anglo-Scot business elite controlled Canadian commerce until the 1950s, founding a Protestant public school system and hospitals and universities such as McGill University. These immigrants were joined by other Europeans in the early 1900s, including Italians and Jews, who assimilated to a large degree into the anglophone community. Many English-speaking Quebeckers left Quebec following the election of the Parti Québécois in 1976 resulting in a steep decline in the anglophone population; many who have remained have learned French in order to function within the dominant Francophone society.\n\n## British Columbia\n\nAs in much of western Canada, many of the earliest European communities in British Columbia began as outposts of the Hudson's Bay Company, founded in London in 1670 to carry on the fur trade via Hudson Bay. Broader settlement began in earnest with the founding of Fort Victoria in 1843 and the subsequent creation of the Colony of Vancouver Island in 1849. The capital, Victoria developed during the height of the British Empire and long self-identified as being \"more English than the English\".\n\nThe Colony of British Columbia was established on the mainland in 1858 by Governor James Douglas as a means of asserting British sovereignty in the face of a massive influx of gold miners, many of whom were American. Despite the enormous distances that separated the Pacific colony from Central Canada, British Columbia joined Confederation in 1871, choosing to become Canadian partly as a means of resisting possible absorption into the United States. Chinese workers, brought in to labour on the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, established sizeable populations in many B.C. communities, particularly Vancouver which quickly became the province's economic and cultural centre after the railway's completion in 1886. Like Ontario, British Columbia has received immigrants from a broad range of countries including large numbers of Germans, Scandinavians, Italians, Sikhs from India and Chinese from Hong Kong, Taiwan and in more recent years, the People's Republic, and the ongoing influx of Europeans from Europe continues. However, for many years British Columbia, in contrast to the Prairie Provinces, received a majority of immigrants from Great Britain: over half in 1911 and over 60 percent by 1921. Over half of people with British ancestry in British Columbia have direct family ties within two generations (i.e. grandparent or parent) to the British Isles, rather than via British ethnic stock from Central Canada or the Maritimes (unlike the Prairies where Canadian-British stock is more common). Europeans of non-British stock have been more common, also, in British Columbia than in any other part of Canada, although certain ethnicities such as Ukrainians and Scandinavians are more concentrated in the Prairies. Except for the Italians and more recent European immigrants, earlier waves of Europeans of all origins are near-entirely assimilated, although any number of accents are common in families and communities nearly anywhere in the province, as has also been the case since colonial times. Interethnic and interracial marriages and were also more common in British Columbia than in other provinces since colonial times.\n\n## Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan\n\nThe French-English tensions that marked the establishment of the earliest English-speaking settlements in Nova Scotia were echoed on the Prairies in the late nineteenth century. The earliest British settlement in Assiniboia (part of present-day Manitoba) involved some 300 largely Scottish colonists under the sponsorship of Thomas Douglas, Lord Selkirk in 1811. The suppression of the rebellions allowed the government of Canada to proceed with a settlement of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta that was to create provinces that identified generally with English Canada in culture and outlook, although immigration included large numbers of people from non English-speaking European backgrounds, especially Scandinavians and Ukrainians.\n\n## Twentieth century\n\nAlthough Canada has long prided itself on its relatively peaceful history, war has played a significant role in the formation of an English Canadian identity. As part of the British Empire, Canada found itself at war against the Central Powers in 1914. In the main, English Canadians enlisted for service with an initial enthusiastic and genuine sense of loyalty and duty. The sacrifices and accomplishments of Canadians at battles such as Vimy Ridge and the Dieppe Raid in France are well known and respected among English Canadians and helped forge a more common sense of nationality. In World War II, Canada made its own separate declaration of war and played a critical role in supporting the Allied war effort. Again, support for the war effort to defend the United Kingdom and liberate continental Europe from Axis domination was particularly strong among English Canadians. In the post war era, although Canada was committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, English Canadians took considerable pride in the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Lester Pearson for his role in resolving the Suez Crisis and have been determined supporters of the peacekeeping activities of the United Nations.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, increasing American cultural influence combined with diminishing British influence, and political and constitutional crises driven by the exigencies of dealing with the Quebec sovereignty movement and Western alienation contributed to something of an identity crisis for English Canadians. George Grant's Lament for a Nation is still seen as an important work relating to the stresses and vulnerabilities affecting English Canada. However, the period of the 1960s through to the present have also seen tremendous accomplishments in English Canadian literature. Writers from English-speaking Canada such as Margaret Atwood, Mordecai Richler, Margaret Laurence, Robertson Davies, Timothy Findley, and Carol Shields dissected the experience of English Canadians or of life in English Canadian society. and assumed a place among the world's best-known English-language literary figures. Journalist Pierre Berton wrote a number of books popularizing Canadian history which had a particular resonance among English-speaking Canadians, while critics and philosophers such as Northrop Frye and John Ralston Saul have attempted to analyze the Canadian experience. Still, particularly at the academic level, debate continues as to the nature of English Canada and the extent to which English Canadians exist as an identifiable identity.\n\n## Geographical distribution\n\nData from this section from Statistics Canada, 2021.\n\n## Symbols\n\nEnglish-speaking Canadians have not adopted symbols specific to themselves. Although English Canadians are attached to the Canadian flag, it is the national flag and intended to be a symbol for all Canadians, regardless of ethnicity or language. The flag debate of 1965 revealed a strong attachment to the Canadian Red Ensign, previously flown as the flag of Canada prior to the adoption of the Maple Leaf in 1965. Even today, there is considerable support for use of the Red Ensign in certain specific circumstances, such as the commemoration ceremonies for the Battle of Vimy Ridge.\n\nThe maple leaf itself, as a symbol, was used as early as 1834 in what is now Quebec as a symbol of the Société St. Jean Baptiste but was adopted for use shortly afterwards by the English-speaking community in Canada. The \"Maple Leaf Forever\" was penned in 1867, at the time of Confederation, and was once regarded as an informal anthem for English Canadians, but the reaction by English-speaking Canadians to a decision of a New Brunswick school to stop the singing of the anthem are attached to the official national anthem, \"O Canada\", by Calixa Lavallée suggests that the official anthem enjoys considerable support.\n\nThe beaver is sometimes seen as another Canadian symbol but is not necessarily specific to English Canadians. It too was used originally in connection with the Société St. Jean Baptiste before coming into currency as a more general Canadian symbol. In the 1973 political satire by Stanley Burke, Frog Fables & Beaver Tales, a spoof on Canadian politics of the Pierre Trudeau era, English Canadians are depicted in the main as well-meaning but not terribly clever beavers (with other animals such as frogs, sea otters and gophers assigned to represent other linguistic and provincial populations). The historical relevance of the beaver stems from the early fur trade. It has been asserted, \"The fur trade in general and the Hudson's Bay Company in particular exercised a profound influence on the sculpting of the Canadian soul.\"\n\nThe Crown has historically been an intangible but significant symbol for many English Canadians. Loyalty to Great Britain created the initial fracture lines between the populations of the Thirteen Colonies and the populations of Nova Scotia and Quebec at the time of the American Revolution and forced the flight of the Loyalists after the end of the war. As such, English Canada developed in the 19th century along lines that continued to emphasize this historical attachment, evident in the naming of cities, parks, and even whole provinces after members of the royal family; the retention of flags, badges, and provincial mottos expressive of loyalty; and enthusiastic responses to royal visits. While such loyalty is no longer as powerful a unifying force as it once was among English Canadians, it continues to exert a noticeable influence on English Canadian culture. According to the author and political commentator Richard Gwyn, \"[t]he British connection has long vanished... it takes only a short dig down to the sedimentary layer once occupied by the Loyalists to locate the sources of a great many contemporary Canadian convictions and conventions.\" Gwyn considers that the modern equivalent of the once talismanic loyalty is \"tolerance\": \"a quality now accepted almost universally as the feature that makes us a distinct people.\"\n\n## Ethnic composition\n\nThe 2001 Census of Canada provides information about the ethnic composition of English-speaking Canadians. This \"refers to the ethnic or cultural group(s) to which the respondent's ancestors belong\". However, interpretation of data is complicated by two factors.\n\n* Respondents were instructed to specify as many ethnic origins as applicable. Thus, if one has seven great-grandparents of English descent and one of Welsh descent, one will answer \"English\" and \"Welsh\" to this question, and in this example the representation of Welsh ancestry is exaggerated. This method is likely to lead to overrepresentation of smaller groups compared to the method in use until 1976, in which only paternal ancestry was reported.If on the other hand one restricts attention to single responses, groups which have arrived in Canada more recently will be overrepresented compared to groups which have been present longer.\n\n* Non-Aboriginal respondents are not discouraged from providing responses denoting origins in North America. The most frequent of these is \"Canadian\". The response \"Canadian\" is in fact provided as an example in the census instructions, based on its frequency in past surveys.\n\nSee the definition of \"ethnic origin\" from the 2001 Census dictionary for further information.\n\nThe data in the following tables pertain to the population of Canada reporting English as its sole mother tongue, a total of 17,352,315 inhabitants out of 29,639,035. A figure for single ethnic origin responses is provide, as well as a total figure for ethnic origins appearing in single or multiple responses (for groups exceeding 2% of the total English-speaking population). The sum of the percentages for single responses is less than 100%, while the corresponding total for single or multiple responses is greater than 100%. The data are taken from the 2001 Census of Canada.\n\nThe remaining ethnic groups (single or multiple responses) forming at least 1% of the English-speaking population are Welsh (2.0%), Swedish (1.5%), Hungarian (1.5%), East Indian (1.4%), Métis (1.4%), Jewish (1.4%), Russian (1.4%), American (1.3%), Jamaican (1.2%) and Chinese (1.1%). The remaining ethnic groups (single response) forming at least 0.5% of the English-speaking population are East Indian (1.0%), Jamaican (0.8%) and Chinese (0.6%).\n\nDepending on the principal period of immigration to Canada and other factors, ethnic groups (other than British Isles, French, and Aboriginal ones) vary in their percentage of native speakers of English. For example, while a roughly equal number of Canadians have at least partial Ukrainian and Chinese ancestry, 82% of Ukrainian Canadians speak English as their sole mother tongue, and only 17% of Chinese Canadians do (though this rises to 34% in the 0 to 14 age group). As the number of second and third-generation Chinese Canadians increases, their weight within the English-speaking population can also be expected to increase. It should also be borne in mind that some percentage of any minority ethnic group will adopt French, particularly in Quebec.\n\n## Language\n\nIn the 2001 Canadian census, 17,572,170 Canadians indicated that they were English-speaking. As discussed in the Introduction, however, this does not mean that 17.5 million people in Canada would necessarily self-identify as being 'English Canadian'.\n\nExcept in Newfoundland and the Maritime provinces, most Canadian English is only subtly different from English spoken in much of the mid-western and western United States. Spoken English in the Maritimes has some resemblance to English of some of the New England states. While Newfoundland speaks a specific Newfoundland English dialect, and so has the most distinct accent and vocabulary, with the spoken language influenced in particular by English and Irish immigration. There are a few pronunciations that are distinctive for most English Canadians, such as 'zed' for the last letter of the alphabet.\n\nEnglish Canadian spelling continues to favour most spellings of British English, including 'centre', 'theatre', 'colour' and 'labour'. Other spellings, such as 'gaol' and 'programme', have disappeared entirely or are in retreat. The principal differences between British and Canadian spelling are twofold: '-ise' and '-yse' words ('organise/organize' and 'analyse' in Britain, 'organize' and 'analyze/analyse' in Canada), and '-e' words ('annexe' and 'grille' in Britain, 'annex' and 'grill' in Canada, but 'axe' in both, 'ax' in the USA). \n\nVocabulary of Canadian English contains a few distinctive words and phrases. In British Columbia, for example, the Chinook word 'skookum' for, variously, 'good' or 'great' or 'reliable' or 'durable', has passed into common use, and the French word 'tuque' for a particular type of winter head covering is in quite widespread use throughout the country.\n\nLanguages besides English are spoken extensively in provinces with English-speaking majorities. Besides French (which is an official language of the province of New Brunswick and in the three territories), indigenous languages, including Inuktitut and Cree are widely spoken and are in some instances influencing the language of English speakers, just as traditional First Nations art forms are influencing public art, architecture and symbology in English Canada. Immigrants to Canada from Asia and parts of Europe in particular have brought languages other than English and French to many communities, particularly Toronto, Vancouver and other larger centres. On the west coast, for example, Chinese and Punjabi are taught in some high schools; while on the east coast efforts have been made to preserve the Scots Gaelic language brought by early settlers to Nova Scotia. In the Prairie provinces, and to a lesser degree elsewhere, there are a large number of second-generation and more Ukrainian Canadians who have retained at least partial fluency in the Ukrainian language.\n\n## Religion\n\nThe population of the provinces other than Quebec in the 2001 Census is some 22,514,455. It is impossible to know with certainty how many of that number would self-identify as 'English Canadians' under the broadest interpretation of the term. Persons self-identifying with 'English' as their primary ethnic origin as part of the 2001 census – Quebec included – totaled slightly less than 6,000,000 persons. However, many Canadians who identify other ethnic origins for the purpose of the census might identify as 'English Canadian' in the broader sense of 'English-speaking Canadians' and possibly share some cultural affinities with the group identifying itself as 'English Canadian' in the more limited sense.\n\nOf the total population of the provinces outside Quebec, the following numbers provide an approximation of the two largest religious groupings: *Protestant: 8,329,260; *Roman Catholic: 6,997,190.\n\nThose claiming no religious affiliation in 2001 numbered 4,586,900.\n\nFor comparison purposes, other religious groups in the provinces other than Quebec in 2001:\n\n* Orthodox Christian: 379,245\n\n* Other Christian: 723,700\n\n* Muslim: 471,620\n\n* Jewish: 340,080\n\n* Hindu: 272,675\n\n* Sikh: 270,185\n\n* Buddhist: 258,965\n\nIn sum, while the single largest religious affiliation of 'English Canadians' – in the Rest of Canada sense of the term – may for convenience be slotted under the different Christian religions called Protestantism, it still represents a minority of the population at less than 37%. So-called 'English Canadians' include a large segment who do not identify as Christian. Even with a clear majority of almost 73%, English Canadian Christians represent a large diversity of beliefs that makes it exceedingly difficult to accurately portray religion as a defining characteristic.\n\n## Literature\n\nHumour, often ironic and self-deprecating, played an important role particularly in early Canadian literature in English, such as Thomas Chandler Haliburton and Stephen Leacock.\n\nIn Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature, Margaret Atwood's seminal book on Canadian Literature published in 1973, the author argues that much of Canadian literature in both English and French is linked thematically to the notion of personal and collective survival. This theme continues to reappear in more recent literary works, such as Yann Martel's Life of Pi, winner of the 2002 Booker Prize.\n\nIn the 1970s authors such as Margaret Laurence in The Stone Angel and Robertson Davies in Fifth Business explored the changing worlds of small town Manitoba and Ontario respectively. Works of fiction such as these gave an entire generation of Canadians access to literature about themselves and helped shape a more general appreciation of the experiences of English-speaking Canadians in that era.\n\n## Arts\n\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, painters in both central Canada and the west coast began applying Post-Impressionist style to Canadian landscape paintings. Painters such as Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven, which included painters such as A.Y. Jackson, captured images of the wilderness in ways that forced English Canadians to discard their conservative and traditional views of art. In British Columbia, Emily Carr, born in Victoria in 1871, spent much of her life painting. Her early paintings of northwest coast aboriginal villages were critical to creating awareness and appreciation of First Nations cultures among English Canadians. The Arctic paintings of Lawren Harris, another member of the Group of Seven, are also highly iconic for English Canadians. Cowboy artist and sculptor Earl W. Bascom of Alberta became known as the \"dean of Canadian cowboy sculpture\" with his depictions of early cowboy and rodeo life.\n\n## Heroes, heroines and national myths\n\nFrom colonial times the arrival and settlement of the first pioneers, the fur trade empire established by the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company – although the fur company histories are more relevant to French Canadians, Métis and Scottish Canadians – as well as the mass resettlement of refugee Loyalists are important starting points for some English Canadians. Some have argued that the Loyalist myth, so often accepted without second thought, represents also a collective English Canadian myth-making enterprise\n\nThe War of 1812 produced one of the earliest national heroes, Laura Secord, who is credited with having made her way through American lines at night to carry a warning to British troops of impending American plans and contributing to the victory at the Battle of Beaver Dams, where the American advance into Upper Canada was turned back.\n\nThe War of 1812 also saw the capture and burning of Washington, D.C. by the British in August 1814, an event still remembered in English Canada. The War of 1812 itself, to which Canadian and aboriginal militia forces made important contributions, is viewed as the event that ensured the survival of the colonies that would become Canada, or, as termed by the critic Northrop Frye \"in many respects a war of independence for Canada.\"\n\nThere is an element of the heroic that attaches to Sir John A. Macdonald, the Scottish lawyer from Kingston, Ontario, who became Canada's first prime minister. His weaknesses (such as an alleged fondness for alcohol, and the multifaceted corruption inherent in the Pacific Scandal) and the controversial events surrounding the rebellions in the west have not erased admiration for his accomplishments in nation building for English Canadians. Macdonald's pragmatism laid the foundation of the national myth of the 'two founding nations' (English and French), which was to endure well into the twentieth century among a strong minority of English Canadians and was eventually reflected in the official government policy that flowed from the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism in the 1960s.\n\nMacdonald was also instrumental in the founding of the North-West Mounted Police in 1875, forerunners of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Canada's iconic national police force. The RCMP itself, established to \"subdue the West\", i.e. the newly acquired Northwest Territories, formerly the HBC's Rupert's Land, as declared in the preamble to its charter. The RCMP, long since eulogized into a moral, symbolic image of Canadian authority, far from its true nature as a paramilitary force commissioned with bringing First Nations and Métis to heel, plays a role in English Canada's perception of itself as a nation of essentially law-abiding citizens that confederated in 1867 for the purposes of establishing peace, order and good government.\n\nThe Klondike Gold Rush of 1898 in the Yukon was another event that resonated in the English Canadian imagination, with its stories of adventure and struggle in a harsh northern environment. The myth of the North itself, the forbidding landscape and difficult climate, peopled by the hardy Inuit is of central importance to English Canadians, from Susanna Moodie (whose 'north' was the 'wilderness' of 1830s southern Ontario) to the present, as the myth of the north is reexamined, challenged and reinvented for an increasingly post-colonial culture.\n\nIn the twentieth century Tommy Douglas, the politician from Saskatchewan who is credited with the creation of Canada's programme of universal health care has been recognized as the greatest Canadian in a contest sponsored by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Canada's national public broadcaster. Lester B. Pearson, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and Prime Minister of Canada responsible for the adoption of the maple leaf flag, is widely regarded as an English Canadian figure.\n\nAnother person who had an enormous impact on English Canadians was British Columbian Terry Fox whose 1981 attempt to run across Canada from St. John's, Newfoundland to the Pacific to raise money for cancer research. Although forced to discontinue the run near Thunder Bay due to a recurrence of his cancer, Terry Fox captured the imagination of millions of Canadians, particularly in the English-speaking provinces. This feat was followed by British Columbian Rick Hansen's successful Man in Motion tour shortly afterwards.\n\nSports heroes include, among many others, the legendary Wayne Gretzky from Ontario who led the Edmonton Oilers to successive Stanley Cup victories in the 1980s; the women's Olympic hockey team that won the Gold Medal in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and Team Canada that won the famed Canada-Russia hockey series in 1972.\n\nRodeo is a popular sport in Canada. One of the great legends of Canadian rodeo is Ray Knight, known as the \"Father of Canadian Professional Rodeo\" having produced Canada's first professional rodeo in 1903. Another Canadian rodeo legend is Earl Bascom. Bascom, is known as the \"Father of Modern Rodeo\" for his rodeo equipment inventions and innovations, was the first rodeo champion to be inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nOther significant figures include Nellie McClung (activist in politics and women's rights), Emily Carr (post-impressionist artist), Billy Bishop (World War I airman), Dr. Frederick Banting (co-discover of insulin) and Dr. Norman Bethune (doctor in China). Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, is often claimed by English Canada because of his residence on Cape Breton Island, although he was born in Scotland and later moved to the United States.\n\nAt the same time, historian and author Charlotte Gray has described Canadians as people who do not do heroes or hero-worship well, preferring instead to celebrate the collective rather than the individual: \"[t]he qualities that are celebrated in our national life today are collective virtues - the bravery of our peace-keepers, the compassion of all Canadians for Manitoba's flood victims … individualism has never been celebrated in Canada. It is not a useful quality for a loose federation perched on a magnificent and inhospitable landscape …\"\n\nThe contribution of French-speaking Canadians to the culture of English Canada is significant. Many popular Canadian symbols such as the maple leaf and the beaver were first adopted by Francophones. Francophone sports figures (particularly in hockey and figure-skating) have always been highly regarded. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister in the early 20th century, is viewed as an important statesman in English Canada. A more controversial figure is Pierre Trudeau, who is often praised for his handling of the October Crisis (also known as the FLQ Crisis) and the process of constitutional reform that implemented the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms but who also caused considerable Western Alienation and has been criticised for the critical failure to bring Quebec into the 1982 agreement on constitutional reform. Trudeau was nevertheless ranked 3rd in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's contest to choose The Greatest Canadian. Haitian-born Francophone Michaëlle Jean, a former Governor-General, has overcome some initial misgivings regarding her appointment. The motto chosen for her arms, Briser les solitudes (break down the solitudes), echoes one of the significant works of early English Canadian fiction, Hugh MacLennan's Two Solitudes which describes the sometimes painful separateness dividing Canada's English and French-speaking populations.\n\nCanada's role in the First and Second World Wars played a large part in the political evolution of Canada and the identity of English Canadians. After the fall of France in 1940 and prior to the entry of the United States into the war in 1942, Canada saw itself as Britain's principal ally against Adolf Hitler. The well-known poem \"In Flanders Fields\", written during the First World War by John McCrae of Guelph, Ontario, is associated with Remembrance Day.\n\n## Popular culture\n\nThe RCMP \"Mountie\" has become a figure associated with Canada in the popular imagination of not only Canada, but other countries as well. Although it has many Francophone officers, in popular culture the mountie has been typically represented by an anglophone, such as Dudley Do-Right, Benton Fraser or Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. The myth of the stalwart (if somewhat rustic) heroic Canadian also appeared in the form of Johnny Canuck, a comic book figure of the mid-twentieth century.\n\nAnne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery of Prince Edward Island is one of English Canada's best known contribution to general popular culture. The themes of gentle slapstick and ironic but affectionate observation of small-town Canadian life that appeared in the work of Stephen Leacock carried forward into the later part of the twentieth century to reappear in successful television sitcoms such as The Beachcombers, Corner Gas and Little Mosque on the Prairie.\n\nCanadian humour took on an even broader form in the comedy of SCTV, in particular the Great White North sketches, The Red Green Show and more recently Trailer Park Boys.\n\nTraditional music in much of English-speaking Canada has sources in the music of Scotland and Ireland, brought to Newfoundland and the Maritime provinces in the 19th century. In the late 20th Century, Maritime artists, particularly musicians from Cape Breton Island such as Rita MacNeil, the Rankin Family, Natalie MacMaster and Ashley MacIsaac and Great Big Sea from Newfoundland achieved substantial popularity and influence throughout English Canada. A Celtic influence is similarly felt in the work of musicians from other parts of Canada, such as Spirit of the West, from British Columbia, Ontarian Stan Rogers, or Manitoba-born Loreena McKennitt.\n\n## See also\n\n* English-speaking Quebecers\n\n* British North America\n\n* Culture of Canada\n\n* List of English Canadians\n\n* British diaspora in Africa\n\n* Canada–United Kingdom relations\n\n## References\n\n* Neil Sutherland, Cynthia Comacchio (2000) Children in English-Canadian society: framing the twentieth-century consensus Wilfrid Laurier University Press, \n\n* Richard Gwyn, (2007) John A: The Man Who Made Us Random House of Canada Ltd, \n\n* Margaret A.

{"id": "6954813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean%20Airlines", "title": "Caribbean Airlines", "text": "Caribbean Airlines Limited is the state-owned airline and flag carrier of Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica. Headquartered in Iere House in Piarco, the airline operates flights to the Caribbean, North America and South America from its base at Piarco International Airport, Trinidad. Presently Caribbean Airlines employs more than 1,600 people and is the largest airline in the Caribbean. The company slogan is The Warmth of the Islands.\n\n## Early years\n\nCaribbean Airlines was incorporated in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on 27 September 2006.\n\nIn September 2006, following the recommendation of Peter Davies, the CEO of BWIA West Indies Airways, Caribbean Airlines got approval from the Trinidad and Tobago government to begin operations, after the failed negotiations between the unions and the management of its predecessor, BWIA. As a result, it was announced on 8 September 2006, that BWIA was to be shut down before the launch of Caribbean Airlines. During the last quarter of 2006, in an effort to scale down operations for the start of Caribbean Airlines, BWIA's management cut routes such as Manchester Airport, London Heathrow Airport, New York City and Toronto, with intermediate stops at Barbados or Antigua, ceased services to and from Saint Lucia, cut its fleet to six Boeing 737-800 jet aircraft retrofitted with wingtip devices (winglets) and reduced its staff to 800, with a majority of the staff former BWIA workers now contracted.\n\nThe new airline's capital included funds to close and settle BWIA's operations. The company commenced operations on 1 January 2007, servicing the remaining routes of BWIA.\n\nCaribbean Airlines began operations with a fleet of six Boeing 737-800 aircraft and one Airbus A340-313 with the latter aircraft type operating the London Heathrow route until May 2007. The airline offered two classes of service, first/business class and economy class on both the Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Caribbean Airlines operated daily direct services to Miami, Toronto, New York, Jamaica (with stops in Barbados and Antigua/St. Maarten), Guyana, Suriname and London Heathrow till May 2007 due to the ICC 2007 Cricket World Cup, all out of its hub at Piarco International Airport. Peter Davies resigned from his position as CEO, effective 30 September 2007, but remained as a strategic advisor to Caribbean Airlines. In the first half of 2007, two Airbus A340-200 planes and a Boeing 737 Next Generation Boeing 737-800, 9Y-GND, were returned to International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and GE Commercial Aviation Services (GECAS), respectively.\n\nOn 1 October 2007, Philip Saunders, Star Alliance VP Commercial, was appointed the new chief executive officer of Caribbean Airlines. Subsequently, the airline took over operations of Tobago Express, its domestic arm at a cost of US$24 million with the intentions to upgrade the fleet of Bombardier Dash-8 Q300 to international standards and also adding new Caribbean destinations to be served via this regional airline subsidiary.\n\nIn March 2008, the airline added a daily direct service to the Simón Bolívar International Airport in Caracas, using the Dash 8 aircraft. In May 2008, Caribbean Airlines acquired a seventh Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The airline added a new U.S. route on 22 May to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport from Piarco International Airport. This route began operations on a four times per week schedule and later in July of the same year, the frequency was increased to daily service.\n\nOn 15 November 2008, Transavia Airlines agreed to operate a wet-lease operation on behalf of Caribbean Airlines, it increased its fleet to eight Boeing 737-800. The aircraft was re-fitted to the standard 16/138 configuration including an extra nine inches of seat pitch in the business class cabin, due to a different galley and closet placement. This allowed the airline to increase flight frequency to meet demand for the peak travel periods. The lease was contracted to be in effect until 15 April 2009. The aircraft was returned in June 2009, and Sun Country Airlines, a U.S. air carrier, then leased a Boeing 737-800 to Caribbean Airlines.\n\nIn April 2009, the airline increased its frequency of service to Simón Bolívar International Airport in Caracas from a daily service to ten flights per week. The route was operated by the Bombardier Dash-8 Q300, configured for 50 passengers in an all economy service. Daily flights to its gateways Fort Lauderdale and Miami continued. Services to Toronto and New York City remained at twice daily and 20 weekly (up to 28 weekly in peak season), respectively.\n\nOn 27 July 2009, Philip Saunders announced his resignation as CEO of Caribbean Airlines, for personal reasons. Caribbean Airlines appointed Captain Ian Brunton in October 2009 as CEO of the airline. Also in 2009, Caribbean Airlines operated services from the southern Caribbean to Jamaica, as well as South America, including Suriname, Guyana and Venezuela. The airline also continued to serve the United States and Canada, in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, New York City and Toronto, having also established a codeshare agreement with British Airways, for services to London and beyond. As of 2009, the airline operated a fleet of eight Boeing 737-800 aircraft and five Bombardier Dash-8 Q300 aircraft, out of its main hub at Piarco International Airport, Trinidad. The Dash 8 aircraft have since been replaced with new ATR 72-600, a larger turboprop aircraft.\n\n## Acquisition of Air Jamaica\n\nCaribbean Airlines Limited, through the government of Trinidad and Tobago, announced plans to operate a base in Jamaica following the divestment of Air Jamaica which was slated to occur between 30 April 2010 to that same period in 2011. Caribbean Airlines provided a seamless transition following Air Jamaica's closure. When the deal was finalized, Caribbean Airlines Limited became the largest airline in the Caribbean with a new hub in Kingston Jamaica's Norman Manley International Airport. The divestment was scheduled to become effective on 30 April 2010 after it was rescheduled from 12 April 2010. On this day, it was planned that Air Jamaica would cease operations and Caribbean Airlines will then acquire the airline's most profitable routes and their remaining six aircraft. Plans were also announced to replace the aircraft fleet with all Boeing 737-800 Next Generation jets.\n\nOn 4 March 2010, Caribbean Airlines announced they would terminate their codeshare agreement with British Airways for the Port of Spain-London Gatwick route effective 27 March 2010 thus paving the way for a nonstop service to be operated by Caribbean between Piarco International Airport and London, UK.\n\nOn 28 April 2010, Caribbean Airlines Limited and Air Jamaica signed a final agreement for the purchase of Air Jamaica by Caribbean Airlines Limited, following the signing of a letter of intent to merge in January of the same year. The agreement stated that Caribbean would continue operating Air Jamaica's routes and also retain 900 of Air Jamaica's employees. Financing was provided by the government of Trinidad and Tobago, which contributed around $50 million to complete the merger, and Jamaica, which assumed more than $800 million in costs related to the closure of Air Jamaica.\n\nIn August 2010, Caribbean Airlines and Air India signed a travel pact for Trinidadians travelling to India. In October, the airline announced a fleet renewal consisting of fifteen (15) Boeing 737-800 Next Generation jets and nine ATR 72-600 turboprop aircraft. The new Boeing jets were intended to replace Air Jamaica's operating fleet of Airbus aircraft.\n\nOn 27 May 2011, the acquisition of Air Jamaica was completed, with Finance Minister Winston Dookeran and Jamaican Finance Minister Audley Shaw at the Prime Minister' St. Clair office, signing the shareholding agreement. This agreement allows the Jamaican government to own a 16% stake of Caribbean Airlines Limited. On 28 October 2011, the U.S. Department of Transportation fined Caribbean Airlines $60,000 for limiting reimbursements for lost, damaged and delayed baggage to less than consumers were entitled under the Montreal Convention.\n\nAccording to chairman of the board of Caribbean Airlines George Nicholas III, Caribbean Airlines is pursuing a relationship with Star Alliance, the world's largest airline alliance, in an effort to support Jamaican hoteliers. It is also reported they are preparing to start a route to Mumbai, but no date has been given. Also, Nicholas announced that Johannesburg, Nigeria, and Brazil are possible contenders for new routes. Chicago and Atlanta are the two new U.S. gateways that are being considered, Nicholas stated.\n\nOn 29 March 2013, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) fined the airline $100,000 for not providing passengers with an opportunity to leave a plane that was delayed on the tarmac at New York's JFK Airport for more than four hours.\n\nIn early 2016, the management of Caribbean Airlines has set as an agenda to consider replacing its ATR fleet with comparable turboprops sourced from Bombardier due to persistent reliability problems. The former chief executive officer (CEO) Michael Di Lollo described the ATRs as \"not mission capable\" after they suffered from frequent AOG (Aircraft On Ground) occurrences. On his recommendation, efforts were made to sourcing Dash 8-400 aircraft to replace the carrier's fleet of five ATR72-600s.\n\nAlso in early 2016, the airline returned its two Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to their lessor, coinciding with termination of its only European route to London Gatwick Airport on 10 January 2016, as part of a streamlining exercise to remove unprofitable routes.\n\nIn 2018, the airline posted an order for 737 MAX-8 aircraft, to replace the aging fleet of 737-800 aircraft. The order was initially placed in 2018, and put on hold after the grounding of the 737 MAX family.\n\nAlso in 2018, the services Caribbean Cafe and Caribbean Plus were launched for the first time. Caribbean Plus served as an upgraded economy class with larger seats and extra legroom, but with the same service. Caribbean Cafe offered buy-on-board local snacks, drinks and amenities.\n\nIn 2019, the airline posted its first profit of four million ($4,000,000 U.S.) dollars.\n\n## Rebranding and revitalization\n\nIn 2020, the airline began a rebranding exercise, introducing a new logo and livery. The first aircraft to receive the new livery, was an ATR 72-600, 9Y-TTI. The new logo retains the iconic hummingbird while infusing fluid lines and brighter hues to embody the spirit of flight, the vibrancy of Caribbean culture and connectivity within the region. The rest of the existing ATR fleet was repainted gradually, with the last aircraft being repainted in 2024. \n\nIn late 2021, the airline began receiving the first of 12 737 MAX-8 aircraft, ordered previously in 2018. The delivery came a year after the 737 MAX was cleared for service by the FAA. Over the course of the next few months, the airline received 9 of these aircraft, ultimately phasing out the 737-800 entirely by 2023.\n\nThe new aircraft were painted in the rebranded livery, with a vastly modernized cabin. The cabin configuration was very similar to that of the 737-800, albeit with slightly more seats. Caribbean View, a stream-to-your-device onboard entertainment system was implemented previously, but was improved on the new aircraft including personal touchscreens for Business Class Passengers.\n\nIn 2023, the airline announced that flights to Caracas, Venezuela would be restarted on a weekly basis, with frequency expected to increase. Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, Caribbean Airlines began flights to Dominica, restarted flights to Ft. Lauderdale and Caracas, introduced a temporary route from Georgetown, Guyana to Houston and stated their plans for fleet expansion and additional destinations in the Caribbean.\n\nIn July 2023, it was announced that new flights to Tortola, British Virgin Islands and San Juan, Puerto Rico were tentatively approved. An Eastern Caribbean route expansion, including flights to Basseterre, St. Kitts & Nevis, was also announced with new flights from Barbados, St. Lucia-Castries, St. Vincent-Argyle, Dominica-Douglas Charles and Antigua. This route expansion coincided with the airline's order for additional ATR 72-600 aircraft.\n\nIn July 2024, the airline began nonstop service between Port of Spain and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Flights to Tortola, British Virgin Islands were announced for October 2024 operating on a milk-run service between Trinidad, Antigua/Barbados, Tortola and San Juan. In October 2024, flights to both Martinique and Guadeloupe were announced for December 2024, and the airline was given further clearance from the government to acquire additional aircraft for expansions into North and South America. \n\nAs of October 2024, the TSA PreCheck program announced that Caribbean Airlines has been added to the list of new participating airlines.\n\n## Branding\n\nThe colors of Caribbean Airlines are blue, green and purple and are represented in the new staff uniforms, all featuring the hummingbird, the logo of Caribbean Airlines.\n\nBWIA's logo was a steelpan. Caribbean Airlines' image is a hummingbird in flight. The image is a reference to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, where the island of Trinidad is known as \"the land of the hummingbird\". All aircraft in the fleet carry the flag of Trinidad and Tobago, as well as the flag of CARICOM.\n\nThe airline had four designs on the tails of its de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 regional aircraft before these twin turboprops were phased out of the fleet (9Y-WIT was not painted). One of the designs raised controversy, due to its usage of the Balisier flower, the symbol of the former ruling People's National Movement political party. The logo was subsequently redesigned without the flower and replaced with fruits. The tail designs featured a steelpan, cricket balls, fruits, corals, fish and butterflies.\n\nCaribbean Airlines has a theme song arranged in a traditional Trinidadian calypso music style. It was originally recorded by Explainer and the song is called \"Lorraine\". The original lyrics, which talk about a man who needs to escape the cold United States and get back to the Caribbean, were modified to fit Caribbean Airlines.\n\nIn 2020, the airline rebranded itself by launching a new logo and livery. The first aircraft to receive the new livery, is the airline's 9Y-TTI ATR aircraft. The new logo retains the iconic hummingbird while infusing fluid lines and brighter hues to embody the spirit of flight, the vibrancy of Caribbean culture and connectivity within the region.\n\n## Awards\n\n* 2010 to 2019: The \"Caribbean's Leading Airline\" - by World Travel Awards\n\n* 2017 to 2021: The \"Caribbean's Leading Airline Brand\" - by World Travel Awards\n\n## Inflight magazine\n\nCaribbean Beat Magazine, established in 1992, is Caribbean Airlines' complimentary, bi-monthly in-flight magazine.

{"id": "52066452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20John%20Sutton", "title": "William John Sutton", "text": "William John Sutton (19 January 1859 – 9 May 1914) was a timberman, geologist, mineralogist, assayer, surveyor, lecturer, explorer, pioneer and promoter of Vancouver Island, British Columbia and stood twice in B.C. elections.\n\n## Biography\n\nSutton was born in Kincardine, Canada West, and was the first of six children born to William Sutton (1828-1893) and Sarah Keyworth (1834-1905); his father emigrated from Dent, Cumbria in 1850 and his mother from Tuxford, Nottinghamshire in 1852. At the age of 33 years Sutton married Helen Annie Fox (1852-1932) who was born in Sheffield and ran the family cutlery store in Victoria. They did not have children.\n\n## Education\n\nSutton attended public schools in Kincardine and Walkerton followed by a year at Trinity College School, Port Hope, Ontario (1873-1874). He then went to Sibley College of Mechanical Arts, Cornell (1874-1876)] but dropped out after completing two years to take a short business course at Hamilton Business College before attending the Columbia School of Mines (1876-1877). In 1895 he took a special course in chemistry, mineralogy, petrography and geology, at the Michigan School of Mines, following which he became assistant teacher helping various professors in metallurgy, assaying, biology, zoology, palaeontology, mineralogy, crystallography, petrology, lithology and geology. Alongside his teaching he completed his degree with a 54-page thesis entitled Geology of Penokee-Gogebic Iron Bearing District in 1898 and was awarded an E.M. (Mining Engineer) degree.\n\n## Timberman\n\nAt the age of 18 years he set up an assaying business in Victoria, Vancouver Island but was forced to close it due to lack of interest and joined his father's lumber business. His father was the first to obtain a timber licence from the government for 7,070 acres of land at Cowichan Lake. He built a sawmill at Snug Creek, Mahoney's Bay (now Genoa Bay). William John, known to his family as Will, ran his father's lumber business for ten years whilst his father was sheriff of Bruce County, Ontario.\n\n## Political ambitions\n\nSutton stood in two elections for the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. His first attempt was in 1887 after the death of Premier William Smithe when he stood for Cowichan but was narrowly beaten by Henry Fry. The second attempt was in 1894 when he stood for Cowichan and Alberni but was again narrowly defeated by Major J.M. Mutter.\n\n## Government assayer\n\nAfter tragedy struck the Sutton family when his cousin Alfred was accidentally shot, the sawmill was closed down and Will was appointed Government Assayer (1887-1889). A report he submitted to the Minister of Mines in 1888 includes a list of 35 examples of economic minerals found in the Province. An article in The Colonist describes his work as Government Assayer. Will was forced to resign to sort out his father's lumber business but under his management the assay office \"had been converted to a model of its kind.\" Shortly after leaving his post he facilitated the sale of the family lumber business.\n\n## Phrenology and grave robbing\n\nWilliam John and his brother James Edward, were both keen phrenologists (a pseudoscience that involves the measurement of bumps on the skull to predict mental traits) and had given several lectures in Victoria on the topic. In connection with phrenology they both began robbing the graves of First Nation people on Vancouver Island to sell the skulls to the American phrenology market. On hearing about their collection of 75 skulls Franz Boas, the 'father of American anthropology' bought the collection. Boas employed the Sutton brothers to collect more. Altogether the Sutton brothers provided Boas with about 200 skulls and skeletons. Boas used the skulls from the Northwest Coast to challenge the scientific idea of a 'pure race.' Franz Boas then sold the remains to Rudolph Virchow's Pathological Museum in Berlin and the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago.\n\n## Sutton Lumber and Trading Company\n\nThe Sutton Lumber and Trading Company Limited was incorporated in 1893 with $100,000 and William, William John and James Edward Sutton were the first trustees. They acquired 2,500 acres of timber land in the Clayoqout District and West Coast of Vancouver Island, some of which were Crown granted and some held under timber leases from the Crown. William John and James Edward were amongst the first white settlers in Ucluelet where they built the first general store and sawmill. The company was eventually sold to W. H. and A. F. McEwan of Seattle, the principals in the Seattle Cedar Lumber Manufacturing Company. Sutton continued to own and manage the Ucluelet Mercantile Company Sawmill until his death.\n\n## Geologist for James Dunsmuir\n\nOn his return to Victoria in 1900 Sutton took up the post of geologist for the coal and rail baron James Dunsmuir. In this position he worked for both the Wellington Colliery Company and the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway as well as being James Dunsmuir's personal geologist and in this role he travelled around British Columbia and further afield looking for opportunities to expand the Dunsmuir empire.\n\nSutton surveyed and geologically mapped much of Vancouver Island as the Wellington Colliery Company owned the coal rights under a large portion of the Island. As part of the Canadian Geological Survey, Sutton surveyed the central part of the eastern coast of Vancouver Island in July 1909. He remained with the Company when they were taken over by Canadian Pacific Railway until his death in 1914, from a heart attack, whilst running a survey line for a road being constructed in Ucluelet.\n\n## Treasure Island\n\nSutton gave several public lectures on the natural wealth of Vancouver Island, including delivering a paper, The Geology and Mining of Vancouver Island, to the Geological Society in Manchester in 1903. He became a leader in the movement to promote the Island to the rest of the world and was instrumental in the establishment of the Vancouver Island Development League being elected to first vice-president of the Victoria branch of the League in 1911 and 1912.\n\n## Forest preservation\n\nWilliam John Sutton was one of the first to advocate preservation of the forests in British Columbia. He gave evidence to several government commissions (1905, 1909) and in 1910 published, as a member of the Natural History Society, a booklet, Our Timber and its Conservation, in which he described 18 commercial species of forest trees. He argued that timber resources in British Columbia were comparatively limited and was critical of current government practice in regard to land leases and taxes. He recommended the government establish a forestry commission identifying key areas for research. He used his booklet to submit evidence to the Fulton Royal Commission on Timber and Forestry and some of his recommendations were accepted by the government. He gave further evidence to an Assessment and Taxation Commission in 1911 as well as to the Forestry and Conservation Convention in Vancouver in January 1914.\n\n## Strathcona Park\n\nAs a member of the British Columbia Board of Trade, the Natural History Society and the Vancouver Island Development League, Sutton played an important role in helping to facilitate the establishment of Strathcona Provincial Park.\n\n## Respected scientist\n\nIn his final years Sutton became a powerful person in British Columbia. He was Chairman of the Western Branch of the Canadian Mining Institute and vice-president of the Canadian Mining Institute (1914); as well as being a Fellow of the Royal Geological Society of London. He sat on the Board of Trade, and had been president of the Natural History Society (1912). He campaigned for a well-equipped seismological station at Victoria (a new Meteorological Station was built at Gonzales Height, Victoria in 1916) and was also a founding member of the Royal Astronomical Society in Victoria, being a member of the executive committee and instrumental in forming the Centre in Victoria.\n\n## Pacific Museum of Earth, Vancouver\n\nSutton is credited with identifying 35 notable occurrences of minerals in Canada, see A List of Canadian Mineral Occurrences, Robert A.A. Johnson, 1915. His unique collection of minerals and fossils was one of the founding collections of the Geology Museum of the University of British Columbia at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum and is on show at the Pacific Museum of Earth, Vancouver.\n\n## Name lives on\n\nWilliam John Sutton's influence on Vancouver Island is visible in the places named after him, such as Sutton Pass, Sutton Boulders, Lost Shoe Creek and Sutton Rock; as well as the Sutton Limestones.\n\n## Photograph album\n\nHis wife, Helen Annie, outlived Sutton by 18 years; she compiled an album of some of his photographs which her sister presented to the archive at the Royal British Columbia Museum in 1933. There are 57 photographs including geological features, First Nation villages, Cowichan Lake and river; and several 'ghost' towns on mainland British Columbia.\n\n## Family legend\n\nWilliam John Sutton was well known in his lifetime, but has since been forgotten. He comes from a line of legendary Suttons. His father William Sutton built the first grist mill in Kincardine, Ontario and became the first sheriff of Bruce County only to be sacked after 25 years. It has been suggested his grandfather, Richard Sutton, was a role model for Emily Brontë's Heathcliff.\n\n## External links\n\n* Will Sutton: The Forgotten Trail Breaker of Vancouver Island\n\n1859 births\n1914 deaths\nCornell University alumni\nColumbia School of Mines alumni"}

{"id": "71486995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide%20of%20Joyce%20Meyer%20Sommers", "title": "Suicide of Joyce Meyer Sommers", "text": "Joyce Marilyn Meyer Sommers (July 20, 1927 – December 18, 1996), also known as the Christmas Tree Lady, was a formerly unidentified American woman who died by suicide in a cemetery in Annandale, Virginia, on December 18, 1996. She was identified more than 25 years later on May 11, 2022.\n\n## Life\n\nSommers was born on July 20, 1927, to Arthur Meyer and Margaret Meyer, and had four siblings. She was raised on a farm in Davenport, Iowa, and later attended Iowa State University. Sommers then relocated to Los Angeles to work at Seventeen magazine while living with an aunt. After she left the magazine in the 1950s, she taught second grade at a local Catholic elementary school. Around that time Sommers began seeing a psychiatrist whose treatments of encouraging one to blame their own family, especially the mother, for their problems alienated Sommers from her family.\n\nIn the 1960s, Sommers' mother visited her in California, where she had a 24-hour \"confrontation session\" with her daughter. Sommers then moved to Seattle and married James E. Sommers, but she didn't inform her family of the event. The couple didn't have children and eventually divorced in 1977. Sommers then moved to a trailer park in Tucson, Arizona, where she was described as being unhappy, according to her siblings. In the early 80s, Sommers' siblings all visited her; she asked them to help build her a home. However, the siblings refused, which greatly upset Sommers. This visit was the last time Sommers was seen by her family. They believed Sommers joined a cult; they later hired a private investigator to locate her, but this effort failed. There were some hints that Sommers moved to the East Coast, but these leads went nowhere. Examinations of police databases indicated that she may have lived in Northern Virginia in 1996, possibly in Alexandria. Public records on LexisNexis also revealed an address for Sommers in downtown Washington, D.C., a townhouse on Massachusetts Avenue which has since been incorporated into another building. \n\nIn the early 1990s, Sommers's brother, Larry, traveled to Tucson in an attempt to locate her, only to find her trailer abandoned. In it, he discovered 4 copies of a book, \"The Target Child\", written by Sommers. In the book, she wrote her account of a traumatic upbringing.\n\n## Suicide\n\nOn December 18, 1996, a little after 9 a.m., workers at the Pleasant Valley Memorial Park Cemetery in Annandale, Virginia, discovered the body of a woman. She was found near the section of the cemetery where infants and children are buried. They then called police. It was discovered that she put a bag over her head and secured the bag with tape. She was wearing a red shirt, a sweater, blue pants, and an Eddie Bauer jacket. An Christmas tree and her backpack were found next to her. She was also found to be listening to a cassette tape using a tape player and headphones. Two notes were found; one said, \"Now I lay me down to sleep, soon to drift to the eternal deep. And though I die and shall not wake, sleep sweeter will be than this life I forsake.\" The second message read, \"Deceased by own hand. Valium plus alcohol. Prefer no autopsy. Please order cremation with funds provided. Thank you, Jane Doe.\" Two $50 bills were found with her. One of the bills was for the cemetery, and the other bill was for the coroner. Authorities determined that she committed suicide by suffocation, but were unable to identify her.\n\n## Investigation\n\nThe unidentified woman, nicknamed the Christmas Tree Lady, was reported to be a Caucasian woman around and between 50 and 70 years old. Alcohol and diazepam were found in her system. Hoping to find a match, authorities looked at many nearby cases which involved missing people, but they failed. In 2000, a colored sketch of the Christmas Tree Lady was released.\n\nIn January 2022, the Texas lab, Othram, conducted tests using DNA. The tests were made possible by donations. In May 2022, Othram discovered a man, David Meyer, who could be the Christmas Tree Lady's brother. After David Meyer looked at the drawing of the Christmas Tree Lady, he was unable to say whether or not she was his sister because the last time he saw her was decades earlier. The detectives were then told to ask his sister, Annette Meyer Clough. After seeing the drawing, Clough said it was definitely Joyce. DNA was taken from Clough, and the Christmas Tree Lady was identified as Sommers. Detectives were unable to find any connection between Sommers and any of the graves. Clough believed that her sister never bore children despite a large scar across her stomach which possibly indicated a Caesarean section.\n\nClough theorized that Sommers chose the children's section of the cemetery as a symbolic nod to her belief that parental abuse can permanently damage children.\n\n## See also\n\n* Lyle Stevik\n\n* Mary Anderson (decedent)\n\n* Unidentified decedent\n\n## References\n\n1996 in Virginia\n1996 suicides\nDecember 1996 events in the United States\nAnnandale, Virginia\nSuicides by asphyxiation\nSuicides in Virginia"}

It was released on the MCA label as a single on 11 October.\n\nIn December 2019, the song went viral on TikTok and climbed to number one on the Spotify Top 50 Viral chart for France.\n\nIt was written by Barbara Pravi (who would later represent France at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 in Rotterdam, Netherlands with the song \"Voilà\", in addition to writing the following year's winning French Junior Eurovision entry \"J'imagine\") and Igit, and produced by Julien Comblat.\n\n## Background\n\n\"Bim bam toi\" is an electropop song performed in French, the national language, with a few words in English. It tells the story of love at first sight. Carla sings:\n\nWith the chorus:\n\nDuring the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2019, it was the second song performed, after \"We Will Rise\" by Jordan Anthony (Australia) and just before \"A Time for Us\" by Tatiana Mezhentseva and Denberel Oorjak (Russia). Having obtained 85 points from the juries (sixth place) and 84 from the televoting (third place), Carla finished fifth with a total of 169 points.\n\nAs early as November, TikTok users were participating in the \"Bim bam toi\" challenge by uploading videos of themselves lip-syncing to the song.

After the war he studied Botany at Sheffield University, followed by a two-year PhD study in genetics.\n\nHe was then recruited by the Plant Breeding Institute (PBI) at Cambridge to study the introduction of useful variation into the wheat crop from its wild relatives. Two years later in 1954 Riley became the founder and first Head of the Cytogenetics Department at the PBI. His target was to increase the wheat gene pool by making the variation in wild relatives available to wheat breeders. In 1957, he discovered the method of doing so by finding the Ph gene. This gene controlled the pairing between the chromosomes of wheat and wild relatives of wheat and soon he was able to demonstrate the cytogenetic ways by which useful genes, such as those that confer novel disease resistances, could be transferred into wheat from a host of wild species. This discovery of the Ph gene allowed the first \"genetic engineering\" and his methods have since been used around the world in all major cereal breeding programmes.\n\nIn 1972, he became Director of the PBI and during his six years as Director strove to improve production in UK arable agriculture, developing fundamental research programmes on breeding and introducing plant molecular biology in the UK. He thus ensured that the PBI's pre-eminence in the application of science to plant breeding. During his directorship wheat yields increased from four tonnes per hectare to 6 t/ha, due in large part to the improved PBI varieties. This was particularly vital at a time when the UK needed to be less reliant on North American imports.\n\nIn 1978 Ralph Riley left the PBI to become Secretary (chief executive) of the Agriculture and Food Research Council (now the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council), where he served as Secretary for seven years and Deputy-Chairman for a further two.\n\nHe was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1967. He was awarded the William Bate Hardy Prize in 1969 and the Royal Medal in 1981. and the Wolf Foundation Prize in Agriculture in 1986. He was knighted for his services to science in 1984.\n\nHe married Joan Norrington in 1949; they had two daughters. He died in Cambridge on 27 August 1999.\n\n## References\n\n1924 births\n1999 deaths\nPeople from Scarborough, North Yorkshire\nRoyal Medal winners\nEnglish geneticists\nFellows of the Royal Society\nForeign associates of the National Academy of Sciences\nKnights Bachelor\nPlant geneticists\nWolf Prize in Agriculture laureates"}

{"id": "17481048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%20worker", "title": "Key worker", "text": "A key worker is a worker in an occupation given preferential treatment by government policy. They may be exempted from rules which apply to the general population or prioritized for the receipt of benefits.\n\n## Societal functioning during public health emergencies\n\nA key worker is a public-sector or private-sector employee who is considered to provide an essential service. The term was also used by the UK government during announcements regarding school shutdowns invoked in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to indicate parents whose occupations entitled them to continue sending their children to schools which were otherwise shut down by government policy, as well as teachers and LSAs at those schools.\n\nA key worker is a public sector or private sector employee who is considered to provide an \"essential service\".\n\n## Key workers jobs that cannot be done remotely\n\n* Energy. Many of the jobs in this field, which includes mining and oil extraction, cannot be done remotely.\n\n* First responders. These are the people communities depend on in emergencies, such as paramedics, firefighters and police.\n\n* Education and child care. Making sure children can grow academically even during a pandemic means vaccinating teachers, their support staff, and daycare employees.\n\n* Agriculture and food production. Many of the outbreaks at the onset of the pandemic were in meatpacking facilities and other food-processing plants.\n\n* Critical retail. (i.e. grocery stores, hardware stores, auto mechanics etc.). Keeping supermarket employees safe makes it possible for others to stay fed while restaurants are temporarily shut down.\n\n* Critical trades. (i.e. construction workers, electricians, plumbers, etc.)\n\n* Manufacturing. These jobs (producing goods) cannot be done remotely.\n\n* Corrections workers. Prisons are the types of closed facilities where the coronavirus can spread quickly.\n\n* Postal Service workers. This group makes sure vital packages get delivered, along with providing other key services.\n\n* Public transit workers. These are the people who make it possible for other essential workers to get to their jobs.(e.g transportation systems)\n\n## Key workers jobs that may be done remotely\n\n* Transportation and logistics. These are the workers who ensure that stores’ shelves remain stocked and other key supplies get where they're needed.\n\n* Food service. States decide which facilities and restaurants are big enough for their employees to get vaccinated in this group.\n\n* Shelter and housing. These are the construction workers and contractors responsible for the construction and repair of houses and other buildings.\n\n* Architects and designers. Responsible for designing buildings and fixtures for both the public administration and the private sector.\n\n* Finance. Families need financial advisers to help them navigate the recession that has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n* Information technology and communication. Videoconferencing and other internet technologies have become a lifeline for many families and businesses during 2020.\n\n* Media. Making sure the public is accurately informed is vital during this public health crisis.\n\n* Legal. While demand for legal services has declined significantly in 2020, these professionals remain essential for many proceedings.\n\n* Engineers. Workers in these occupations play a major public safety role by guaranteeing that projects meet the appropriate standards and guidelines.\n\n* Water and wastewater. Keeping the water supply safe means being able to keep these professionals on the job.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, UK schools were closed except for children of \"key workers\" defined by the government. To obtain a school place, at least one parent had to be a key worker.\n\nWork was not restricted to key workers: other workers could still go to work if they could not work from home.\n\nThe UK government on 19 March 2020 defined which groups of staff are considered Key Workers or Critical Workers for schooling purposes, with the following definitions:\n\n* Health and social care. This includes but is not limited to doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, pharmacists, social workers, care workers, and other frontline health and social care staff including volunteers; the support and specialist staff required to maintain the UK's health and social care sector; those working as part of the health and social care supply chain, including producers and distributors of medicines and medical and personal protective equipment.\n\n* Education and childcare. This includes childcare, support and teaching staff, social workers and those specialist education professionals who must remain active during the COVID-19 response to deliver this approach.\n\n* Key public services. This includes those essential to the running of the justice system, religious staff, charities and workers delivering key frontline services, those responsible for the management of the deceased, and journalists and broadcasters who are providing public service broadcasting.\n\n* Local and national government. This only includes those administrative occupations essential to the effective delivery of the COVID-19 response, or delivering essential public services, such as the payment of benefits, including in government agencies and arms-length bodies.\n\n* Food and other necessary goods. This includes those involved in food production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery, as well as those essential to the provision of other key goods (for example hygienic and veterinary medicines). This also includes cleaners in supermarkets.\n\n* Public safety and national security. This includes police and support staff, Ministry of Defence civilians, contractor and armed forces personnel (those critical to the delivery of key defence and national security outputs and essential to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic), fire and rescue service employees (including support staff), National Crime Agency staff, those maintaining border security, prison and probation staff and other national security roles, including those overseas.\n\n* Transport. This includes those who will keep the air, water, road and rail passenger and freight transport modes operating during the COVID-19 response, including those working on transport systems through which supply chains pass.\n\n* Utilities, communication and financial services. This includes staff needed for essential financial services provision (including but not limited to workers in banks, building societies and financial market infrastructure), the oil, gas, electricity and water sectors (including sewerage), information technology and data infrastructure sector and primary industry supplies to continue during the COVID-19 response, as well as key staff working in the civil nuclear, chemicals, telecommunications (including but not limited to network operations, field engineering, call centre staff, IT and data infrastructure, 999 and 111 critical services), postal services and delivery, payments providers and waste disposal sectors.\n\n## Military need\n\nDuring the Second World War in Germany, professionals who were indispensable to carry out a military, transport or administrative defence task could be freed from military service in the German Wehrmacht. They could be granted status as a key worker (\"Schlüsselkraft\") per § 5 Abs. 2 WehrGesetz. The term is still in use if reservists of the German Army (Bundeswehr) cannot attend military exercises, for example.\n\n## United Kingdom housing policies\n\nThe term has been used in the United Kingdom in the context of workers who may find it difficult to buy property in the area where they work. As of 2005, use of the term had become more prominent in the UK as escalating house prices resulted in a gap between household income and the cost of housing. Many local authorities and other public sector bodies, especially in London and the South East, where a \"Key worker living scheme\" operates have been facing major problems recruiting and retaining their workers many of whom are on lower levels of pay than the private sector in terms of housing in most cases the social rented sector is unable to provide low cost housing for rent or shared ownership. In response initiatives have been designed to house key workers, including low-cost loans and shared ownership schemes.\n\nThe key worker living programme defined key workers to include:\n\n* Clinical National Health Service staff including doctors and dentists\n\n* Teachers and nursery nurses\n\n* Police officers, police community support officers and some civilian police staff\n\n* Prison officers and some other prison staff\n\n* Probation Service staff\n\n* Social workers, educational psychologists, and therapists\n\n* Local authority planners\n\n* Firefighters, fire safety engineers\n\n* Connexions personal advisers\n\n* Some Ministry of Defence personnel\n\n* Environmental health officers\n\n* National Highways traffic officers\n\n* Railway workers [Network Rail] freight and passenger trains\n\nThe definition can be extended to include those support staff without whom the above roles may struggle to function.\n\n## Immigration\n\nWhile Austria does not define the term key worker itself, it implies it is a skilled worker from a long and annually adjusted list of \"shortage occupations\". It defines self employed key worker, as someone whose self-employed \"occupation creates macroeconomic benefit going beyond its own operational benefit in Austria\".\n\n## External links\n\n* Martin, Geoff, \"Just what is a 'key worker'?\", The Guardian, March 21, 2001.\n\nEmployment in the United Kingdom\nCOVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom\nCOVID-19 pandemic in the United States\nPublic economics\nOccupations"}

{"id": "152830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui%20people", "title": "Hui people", "text": "The Hui people are an East Asian ethnoreligious group predominantly composed of Chinese-speaking adherents of Islam. They are distributed throughout China, mainly in the northwestern provinces and in the Zhongyuan region. According to the 2010 census, China is home to approximately 10.5 million Hui people. Outside China, the 170,000 Dungan people of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the Panthays in Myanmar, and many of the Chin Haws in Thailand are also considered part of the Hui ethnicity.\n\nThe Hui were referred to as Hanhui during the Qing dynasty to be distinguished from the Turkic Muslims, which were referred to as Chanhui. The Republic of China government also recognised the Hui as a branch of the Han Chinese rather than a separate ethnic group. In the National Assembly of the Republic of China, the Hui were referred to as Nationals in China proper with special convention. The Hui were referred to as Muslim Han people by Bai Chongxi, the Minister of National Defense of the Republic of China at the time and the founder of the Chinese Muslim Association. Some scholars refer to this group as Han Chinese Muslims, Han Muslims or Chinese Muslims, while others call them Chinese-speaking Muslims or Sino-Muslims.\n\nThe Hui were officially recognised as an ethnic group by the People's Republic of China government in 1954. The government defines the Hui people to include all historically Muslim communities not included in China's other ethnic groups; they are therefore distinct from other Muslim groups such as the Uyghurs. \n\nThe Hui predominantly speak Chinese, while using some Arabic and Persian phrases. The Hui ethnic group is unique among Chinese ethnic minorities in that it is not associated with a non-Sinitic language. The Hui have a distinct connection with Islamic culture. For example, they follow Islamic dietary laws and reject the consumption of pork, the most commonly consumed meat in China, and have therefore developed their own variation of Chinese cuisine. They also have a traditional dress code, with some men wearing white caps (taqiyah) and some women wearing headscarves, as is the case in many Islamic cultures.\n\n## Ancestry\n\nHui Muslims descend from Europeans, Arabs, Indo-Iranian Persians, Mongols, Turkic Uyghurs and other Central Asian immigrants. Their ancestors were of Middle Eastern, Central Asian and East Asian origin, who spread Islam in the area. Several medieval Chinese dynasties, particularly the Tang, Song and Mongol, witnessed foreign immigration from predominantly Muslim Persia and Central Asia, with both dynasties welcoming foreign Muslim traders from these regions and appointing Central Asian officials. In subsequent centuries, the immigrants gradually spoke Chinese and settled down, eventually forming the Hui.\n\n## Genetics\n\nA study in 2004 calculated that 6.7 percent of Hui peoples' matrilineal genetics have a West-Eurasian origin and 93.3% are East-Eurasian, reflecting historical records of the population's frequent intermarriage, especially with Mongol women. Studies of the Ningxia and Guizhou Hui also found only minor genetic contributions from West-Eurasian populations. Analysis of the Guizhou Hui's Y chromosomes showed a high degree of paternal North or Central Asian heritage, indicating the population formed through male-dominated migration, potentially via a northern route, followed by massive assimilation of Guizhou aborigines into Han Chinese and Hui Muslims. \n\nThe East Asian Y-chromosome haplogroup O-M122 is found in large quantities, about 24–30%, in other Muslims groups close to the Hui like the Dongxiangs, Bo'an, and Salar people. While the Y chromosome haplogroup R1a (found among Central Asians, South Asians and Europeans) are found among 17–28% of them. Western mtDNA makes up 6.6% to 8%. Other haplogroups include D-M174, N1a1-Tat, and Q, commonly found among East Asians and Siberians. The majority of Tibeto-Burmans, Han Chinese, and Ningxia and Liaoning Hui share paternal Y chromosomes of East Asian origin which are unrelated to Middle Easterners and Europeans. In contrast to distant Middle Easterners and Europeans with whom the Muslims of China are not significantly related, East Asians, Han Chinese, and most of the Hui and Dongxiang of Linxia share more genes with each other. This indicates that native East Asian populations were culturally assimilated, and that the Hui population was formed through a process of cultural diffusion.\n\nAn overview study in 2021 estimated that West Eurasian-related admixture among the average Northwestern Chinese minority groups was at ~9.1%, with the remainder being dominant East-Eurasian ancestry at ~90.9%. The study also showed that there is a close genetic affinity among these ethnic minorities in Northwest China (including Uyghurs, Huis, Dongxiangs, Bonans, Yugurs and Salars) and that these cluster closely with other East Asian people, especially in Xinjiang, followed by Mongolic, and Tungusic speakers, indicating the probability of a shared recent common ancestor of \"Altaic speakers\". A genome study, using the ancestry-informative SNP (AISNP) analysis, found only 3.66% West-Eurasian-like admixture among Hui people, while the Uyghurs harbored the relative highest amount of West-Eurasian-like admixture at 36.30%.\n\n## Official\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the term \"Hui\" was applied by the Chinese government to one of China's ten historically Islamic minorities. Today, the Chinese government defines the Hui people as an ethnicity without regard to religion, and includes those with Hui ancestry who do not practice Islam.\n\nChinese census statistics count among the Hui (and not as officially recognized separate ethnic groups) the Muslim members of a few small non-Chinese-speaking communities. These include several thousand Utsuls in southern Hainan Province, who speak an Austronesian language (Tsat) related to the language of the Vietnamese Champa Muslim minority. According to anthropologist Dru Gladney, they descend from Champa people who migrated to Hainan. A small Muslim minority among Yunnan's Bai people are classified as Hui as well, although they speak Bai. Some groups of Tibetan Muslims are classified as Hui as well.\n\n## Huihui\n\nHuihui () was the usual generic term for China's Muslims (White Hui), Persian Christians (Black Hui) and Jews (Blue Hui) during the Ming and Qing dynasties. It is thought to have had its origin in the earlier Huihe () or Huihu (), which was the name for the Uyghur State of the 8th and 9th centuries. Although the ancient Uyghurs were not Muslims the name Huihui came to refer to foreigners, regardless of language or origin, by the time of the Yuan (1271–1368) and Ming dynasties (1368–1644). The use of Hui to denote all foreigners—Muslims, Nestorian Christians, or Jews—reflects bureaucratic terminology developed over the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Arab were white cap, Persians black cap and Jews blue cap Huihui. Islamic mosques and Jewish synagogues at the time were denoted by the same word, Qīngzhēnsì (: Temple of Purity and Truth).\n\nKublai Khan called both foreign Jews and Muslims in China Huihui when he forced them to stop halal and kosher methods of preparing food:\n\"Among all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say \"we do not eat Mongol food\". [Cinggis Qa’an replied:] \"By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?\" He thereupon made them eat. \"If you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.\" He issued a regulation to that effect... [In 1279/1280 under Qubilai] all the Muslims say: \"if someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat\". Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision.\"\n\nThe widespread and rather generic application of the name Huihui in Ming China was attested to by foreign visitors as well. Matteo Ricci, the first Jesuit to reach Beijing (1598), noted that \"Saracens are everywhere in evidence . . . their thousands of families are scattered about in nearly every province\" Ricci noted that the term Huihui or Hui was applied by Chinese not only to \"Saracens\" (Muslims) but also to Chinese Jews and supposedly even to Christians. In fact, when the reclusive Wanli Emperor first saw a picture of Ricci and Diego de Pantoja, he supposedly exclaimed, \"Hoei, hoei. It is quite evident that they are Saracens\", and had to be told by a eunuch that they actually weren't, \"because they ate pork\". The 1916 Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, Volume 8 said that Chinese Muslims always called themselves Huihui or Huizi, and that neither themselves nor other people called themselves Han, and they disliked people calling them Dungan. French army Commandant Viscount D'Ollone wrote a report on what he saw among Hui in 1910. He reported that due to religion, Hui were classed as a different nationality from Han as if they were one of the other minority groups.\n\nHuizu is now the standard term for the \"Hui nationality\" (ethnic group), and Huimin, for \"Hui people\" or \"a Hui person\". The traditional expression Huihui, its use now largely restricted to rural areas, would sound quaint, if not outright demeaning, to modern urban Chinese Muslims.\n\n## Other nomenclature\n\nIslam was originally called Dashi Jiao during the Tang dynasty, when Muslims first appeared in China. \"Dashi Fa\" literally means \"Arab law\" in Old Chinese. Since almost all Muslims in China were exclusively foreign Arabs or Persians at the time, it was rarely mentioned by the Chinese, unlike other religions like Zoroastrism or Mazdaism, and Nestorian Christianity, which gained followings in China. As an influx of foreigners, such as Persians, Jews and Christians, the majority of whom were Muslims who came from western regions, were labelled as Semu people, but were also mistaken by Chinese for Uyghur, due to them coming from the west (Uyghur lands). The name \"Hui Hui\" was applied to them, and eventually became the name applied to Muslims.\n\nAnother, probably unrelated, early use of the word Huihui comes from the History of Liao, which mentions Yelü Dashi, the 12th-century founder of the Kara-Khitan Khanate, defeating the Huihui Dashibu () people near Samarkand—apparently, referring to his defeat of the Khwarazm ruler Ahmed Sanjar in 1141. Khwarazm is referred to as Huihuiguo in the Secret History of the Mongols as well.\n\nWhile Huihui or Hui remained a generic name for all Muslims in Imperial China, specific terms were sometimes used to refer to particular groups, e.g. Chantou Hui (\"turbaned Hui\") for Uyghurs, Dongxiang Hui and Sala Hui for Dongxiang and Salar people, and sometimes even Han Hui () (\"Chinese Hui\") for the (presumably Chinese-speaking) Muslims more assimilated into the Chinese mainstream society.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) defined the term Hui as indicating only Sinophone Muslims. In 1941, this was clarified by a CCP committee comprising ethnic policy researchers in a treatise entitled \"On the question of Huihui Ethnicity\" (回回民族问题, Huíhui mínzú wèntí). This treatise defined the characteristics of the Hui nationality as an ethnic group associated with, but not defined by, Islam and descended primarily from Muslims who migrated to China during the Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), as distinct from the Uyghur and other Turkic-speaking ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The Nationalist government by contrast recognised all Muslims as one of \"the five peoples\"—alongside the Manchus, Mongols, Tibetans and Han Chinese—that constituted the Republic of China.\n\nA traditional Chinese term for Islam is \"\" (pinyin: , literally \"the religion of the Hui\"). However, since the early days of the PRC, thanks to the arguments of such Marxist Hui scholars as Bai Shouyi, the standard term for \"Islam\" within the PRC has become the transliteration \"\" (pinyin: , literally \"Islam religion\"). The more traditional term Huijiao remains in use in Singapore, Taiwan and other overseas Chinese communities.\n\nQīngzhēn: (, literally \"pure and true\") has also been a popular term for Muslim culture since the Yuan or Ming dynasty. Gladney suggested that a good translation for it would be the Arabic . i.e. \"ritual or moral purity\" The usual term for a mosque is (), i.e. \"true and pure temple\", and is commonly used to refer to halal eating establishments and bathhouses.\n\nIn contrast, the Uyghurs were called \"Chan Tou Hui\" (\"Turban Headed Muslim\"), and the Turkic Salars called \"Sala Hui\" (Salar Muslim), while Turkic speakers often referred to Hui as \"Dungan\".\n\nZhongyuan ren: During the Qing dynasty, the term Zhongyuan ren () was the term for all Chinese, encompassing Han Chinese and Hui in Xinjiang or Central Asia. While Hui are not Han, they consider themselves to be Chinese and include themselves in the larger group of Zhongyuan ren. The Dungan people, descendants of Hui who fled to Central Asia, called themselves Zhongyuan ren in addition to the standard labels lao huihui and huizi. was used by Turkic Muslims to refer to ethnic Chinese. When Central Asian invaders from Kokand invaded Kashgar, in a letter the Kokandi commander criticised the Kashgari Turkic Muslim Ishaq for allegedly not behaving like a Muslim and wanting to be a (Chinese).\n\nSome Uyghurs barely see any difference between Hui and Han. A Uyghur social scientist, Dilshat, regarded Hui as the same people as Han, deliberately calling Hui people Han and dismissing the Hui as having only a few hundred years of history.\n\nPusuman: Pusuman was a name used by Chinese during the Yuan dynasty. It could have been a corruption of Musalman or another name for Persians. It means either Muslim or Persian. Pusuman Kuo (Pusuman Guo) referred to the country where they came from. The name \"Pusuman zi\" (pusuman script), was used to refer to the script that the HuiHui (Muslims) were using.\n\nMuslim Chinese: The term Chinese Muslim is sometimes used to refer to Hui people, given that they speak Chinese, in contrast to, e.g., Turkic-speaking Salars. During the Qing dynasty, Chinese Muslim (Han Hui) was sometimes used to refer to Hui people, which differentiated them from non-Chinese-speaking Muslims. However, not all Hui are Muslims, nor are all Chinese Muslims, Hui. For example, Li Yong is a famous Han Chinese who practices Islam and Hui Liangyu is a notable atheist Hui. In addition, most Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kirghiz and Dongxiang in China are Muslims, but are not Hui.\n\nJohn Stuart Thomson, who traveled in China, called them \"Mohammedan Chinese\". They have also been called \"Chinese Mussulmans\", when Europeans wanted to distinguish them from Han Chinese.\n\n## Non-Muslim Huis\n\nThroughout history, the identity of Hui people has been fluid, often changing as was convenient. Some identified as Hui out of interest in their ancestry or because of government benefits. These Hui are concentrated on the southeast coast of China, especially Fujian province.\n\nSome Hui clans around Quanzhou in Fujian, such as the Ding and Guo families, identify themselves by ethnicity and no longer practice Islam. In recent years, more of these clans have identified as Hui, increasing the official population. They provided evidence of their ancestry and were recognized as Hui. Many clans across Fujian had genealogies that demonstrated Hui ancestry. These clans inhabited Fujian, Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. None of these clans were Muslims but they do not offer pork during their ancestral worship.\n\nIn Taiwan, the Hui clans who followed Koxinga to Formosa to defeat the Dutch settlers no longer observe Islam and their descendants embrace the Chinese folk religion. The Taiwanese branch of the Guo (Kuo in Taiwan) clan with Hui ancestry does not practice Islam, yet does not offer pork at their ancestral shrines. The Chinese Muslim Association counts these people as Muslims. Also on Taiwan, one branch of the Ding (Ting) clan that descended from Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar resides in Taisi Township in Yunlin County. They trace their descent through him via the Quanzhou Ding family of Fujian. While pretending to be Han Chinese in Fujian, they initially practiced Islam when they came to Taiwan 200 years ago, but their descendants have embraced Buddhism or Taoism.\n\nAn attempt was made by the Chinese Islamic Society to convert the Fujian Hui of Fujian back to Islam in 1983, by sending four Ningxia imams to Fujian. This futile endeavour ended in 1986, when the final Ningxia imam left. A similar endeavour in Taiwan also failed.\n\nUntil 1982, a Han could \"become\" Hui by converting to Islam. Thereafter, a converted Han counts instead as a \"Muslim Han\". Symmetrically, Hui people consider other Hui who do not observe Islamic practices as still Hui, and that their Hui nationality cannot be lost. For both of these reasons, simply calling them \"Chinese Muslims\" is no longer accurate, strictly speaking, just as with Bosniaks in former Yugoslavia.\n\n## Population\n\nThe Hui nationality is the most widely distributed ethnic minority in China, and it is also the main ethnic minority in many provinces. There are 10,586,087 Hui people in China (2010 census), accounting for 0.79% of the total population, making them the third largest ethnic group after Han Chinese and Zhuang.\n\nNingxia Hui Autonomous Region and Gansu Province have a Hui population of more than one million. In Ningxia, 33.95% of the population are of Hui ethnicity. Hui are the major minority in Qinghai (15.62%), Gansu and Shaanxi and is the overall major minority in Henan and Anhui.\n\n## Dungan\n\nDungan (; ) is a term used in Central Asia and in Xinjiang to refer to Chinese-speaking Muslim people. In the censuses of Russia and Central Asian nations, the Hui are distinguished from Chinese, termed Dungans. However, in both China and Central Asia members of this ethnic group call themselves Lao Huihui or Zhongyuanren, rather than Dungan. Zhongyuan 中原, literally means \"The Central Plain,\" and is the historical name of Shaanxi and Henan provinces. Most Dungans living in Central Asia are descendants of Hui people from Gansu and Shaanxi.\n\nHui people are referred to by Central Asian Turkic speakers and Tajiks by the ethnonym Dungan. Joseph Fletcher cited Turkic and Persian manuscripts related to the preaching of the 17th century Kashgarian Sufi master Muhammad Yūsuf (or, possibly, his son Afaq Khoja) inside the Ming Empire (in today's Gansu and/or Qinghai), where the preacher allegedly converted ulamā-yi Tunganiyyāh (i.e., \"Dungan ulema\") into Sufism.\n\nAs early as the 1830s, Dungan, in various spellings appeared in both English and German, referring to the Hui people of Xinjiang. For example, James Prinsep in 1835 mentioned Muslim \"Túngánis\" in Chinese Tartary. The word (mostly in the form \"Dungani\" or \"Tungani\", sometimes \"Dungens\" or \"Dungans\") acquired currency in English and other western languages when books in the 1860–70s discussed the Dungan Revolt.\n\nLater authors continued to use variants of the term for Xinjiang Hui people. For example, Owen Lattimore, writing ca. 1940, maintained the terminological distinction between these two related groups: the Donggan or \"Tungkan\" (the older Wade-Giles spelling for \"Dungan\"), described by him as the descendants of the Gansu Hui people resettled in Xinjiang in the 17–18th centuries, vs. e.g. the \"Gansu Moslems\" or generic \"Chinese Moslems\".\n\nThe name \"Dungan\" sometimes referred to all Muslims coming from China proper, such as Dongxiang and Salar in addition to Hui. Reportedly, the Hui disliked the term Dungan, calling themselves either Huihui or Huizi.\n\nIn the Soviet Union and its successor countries, the term \"Dungans\" (дунгане) became the standard name for the descendants of Chinese-speaking Muslims who emigrated in the 1870s and 1880s to the Russian Empire, mostly to today's Kyrgyzstan and south-eastern Kazakhstan.\n\n## Panthay\n\nThe Panthay are a group of Chinese Muslims in Myanmar (Burma) and Yunnan Province. In Thailand, Chinese Muslims are referred to as Chin Ho ().\n\n## Utsul\n\n \nThe Utsuls of Hainan are a Chamic-speaking ethnic group which lives southernmost tip of the island near the city of Sanya. They are thought to be descendants of Cham refugees who fled their homeland of Champa in what is now modern Central Vietnam to escape the Vietnamese invasion. Although they are culturally, ethnically and linguistically distinct from the Hui, the Chinese government nevertheless classifies them as Hui due to their Islamic faith.\n\n## Origins\n\nMany Hui are direct descendants of Silk Road travelers. On the southeast coast (e.g., Guangdong, Fujian) and in major trade centers elsewhere in China, some are of mixed local and foreign descent. The foreign element, although greatly diluted, came primarily from Iranian (Bosi) traders, who brought Islam to China. These foreigners settled and gradually intermarried, while assimilating into Chinese culture.\n\nEarly European explorers speculated that T'ung-kan (Dungans, i.e. Hui, called \"Chinese Mohammedans\") in Xinjiang, originated from Khorezmians who were transported to China by the Mongols, and descended from a mixture of Chinese, Iranian and Turkic peoples. They also reported that the T'ung-kan were Shafi'ites, as were the Khorezmians.\n\nThe Hui people of Yunnan and Northwestern China resulted from the convergence of Mongol, Turkic, and Iranian peoples or other Central Asian settlers recruited by the Yuan dynasty, either as artisans or as officials (the semu). The Hui formed the second-highest stratum in the Yuan ethnic hierarchy (after the Mongols but above Chinese). A proportion of the ancestral nomad or military ethnic groups were originally Nestorian Christians, many of whom later converted to Islam under the Ming and Qing dynasties.\n\nHowever, Hui peoples from Gansu, along with their Dongxian neighbors, did not receive substantial gene flow from Western and Central Asia or European populations during their Islamization.\n\n## Sects of Islam\n\nMost Hui people are Sunni Muslims, and their Islamic sects can be divided into:\n\n* Gedimu (Old Sect): This is the oldest and most widely followed sect in China. Members typically do not actively proselytise. It is divided into four main Sufi orders, each with its own hereditary leader. Each order has gongbei, which serve as the tombs of its leader.\n\n* \n* Jahriyya (also known as the Loud Chanting Sect)\n\n* \n* Khufiyya (also known as the Quiet Chanting Sect)\n\n* \n* Qadiriyya (meaning “The Great One”)\n\n* \n* Kubrawiyya (meaning “The Magnificent One”)\n\n* Yihewani (New Sect): This sect focuses exclusively on the Quran, without establishing any Sufi order, gongbei, or hereditary leadership.\n\n* Salafi (New New Sect): Influenced by Wahhabi thought, this sect aims to reform the New Sect and advocates for a return to the purity and spirituality of early Islam.\n\n* Xidaotang (Chinese Learning Sect): This sect, founded on the Chinese translations of Islamic texts by scholars like Liu Zhi, has a centralised religious authority. Its leader serves for life but does not pass down the position hereditarily.\n\nMa Tong recorded that the 6,781,500 Sunni Hui in China followed 58.2% Gedimu, 21% Yihewani, 10.9% Jahriyya, 7.2% Khuffiya, 1.4% Qadariyya and 0.7% Kubrawiyya Sufi schools.\n\nAmong the northern Hui, Central Asian Sufi schools such as Kubrawiyya, Qadiriyya, and Naqshbandiyya (Khufiyya and Jahriyya) were strong influences, mostly of the Hanafi Madhhab. Hui Muslims have a long tradition of synthesizing Confucian teachings with Qur'anic teachings and reportedly have contributed to Confucianism from the Tang period on. Before the \"Yihewani\" movement, a Chinese Muslim sect inspired by the Middle Eastern reform movement, northern Hui Sufis blended Taoist teachings and martial arts practices with Sufi philosophy.\n\n## Kaifeng Jews\n\nMany Jews in China, for example the Kaifeng Jews, and in particular the Jewish Zhang family Zhang of Kaifeng at the start of the 20th century, converted to Islam and became Hui people.\n\n## Converted Han\n\nAccording to legend, a Muhuyindeni person converted an entire village of Han with the surname Zhang to Islam. Hui also adopted Han children and raised them as Hui. Hui in Gansu with the surnames Tang (唐) and Wang (汪) descended from Han Chinese who converted to Islam and married Muslim Hui or Dongxiangs, joining the Hui and Dongxiang ethnic groups, both Muslim. Tangwangchuan and Hanjiaji were notable as towns with a multi-ethnic community, with both non-Muslims and Muslims.\n\nKuomintang official Ma Hetian visited Tangwangchuan and met an \"elderly local literatus from the Tang clan\" while he was on his inspection tour of Gansu and Qinghai.\n\t\nIn Gansu province in the 1800s, a Muslim Hui woman married into the Han Chinese Kong lineage of Dachuan District, which was descended from Confucius. The Han Chinese groom and his family converted to Islam after the marriage. In 1715 in Yunnan province, a few Han Chinese descendants of Confucius also surnamed Kong married Hui women and converted to Islam. \n\t\nAround 1376 the 30-year-old Chinese merchant Lin Nu visited Ormuz in Persia, converted to Islam, and married a Semu girl (\"\") (either Persian or Arab) and brought her back to Quanzhou in Fujian. The Confucian philosopher Li Zhi was their descendant.\n\n## Modern period\n\nDuring China's land reform movement (which began after the defeat of the Japanese in the Second Sino-Japanese War and continued in the early years of the People's Republic of China), the Communist Party encouraged rural women in achieving a \"double fanshen\"—a revolutionary transformation as both a peasant and a feminist awakening as a woman. The progress of Hui women was promoted as by the party as an example of such a success. Through the rural movement, Hui women were said to have not just received land, but also \"freedom over their own bodies.\" Hui women embraced political participation and the rural revolution. The land reform movement succeeded among Hui people because activists first won over elder generations.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution wreaked much havoc on all cultures and ethnicities in China. The quelling of Hui militant rebels at the hands of the People's Liberation Army in Yunnan, known as the Shadian incident, reportedly claimed over 1,600 lives in 1975.\n\n## Current situation\n\nDifferent Muslim ethnic groups in different regions are treated differently by the Chinese government in regards to religious freedom. A greater freedom is permitted for Hui Muslims, who can practice their religion, build mosques, and have their children attend mosques, while more controls are placed specifically on Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Since the 1980s, Islamic private schools have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government in Muslim areas, except for Xinjiang due to the separatist sentiment there. Although religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the CCP allows Hui Muslims to have their children educated in the religion and attend mosques, while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students who would like to, embark on religious studies under an imam. China does not enforce the law against children attending mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside of Xinjiang.\n\nHui religious schools are also allowed to establish a large autonomous network of mosques and schools run by a Hui Sufi leader, which was formed with the approval of the Chinese government even though he admitted to attending an event where Osama Bin Laden spoke.\n\nHui Muslims who are employed by the state are allowed to fast during Ramadan, unlike Uyghurs in the same positions. The number of Hui going on Hajj is expanding, while Uyghurs find it difficult to get passports to go on Hajj. Hui women are allowed to wear veils, while Uyghur women are discouraged from wearing them. Many Hui women wear veils and headscarves. There is a major halal industry and Islamic clothing industry to manufacture Muslim attire such as skull caps, veils, and headscarves in the Hui region of Ningxia.\n\nChina banned a book entitled Xing Fengsu (\"Sexual Customs\") which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese Hui Muslims. During the protests, the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protestors, and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book. The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs.\n\nIn 2007, anticipating the coming \"Year of the Pig\" in the Chinese calendar, depictions of pigs were banned from CCTV \"to show respect to Islam, and upon guidance from higher levels of the government\".\n\n## Allegation of repression\n\nHui Muslims have been alleged to have experienced greater repression of religious activities in recent years. In 2018, paramount leader Xi Jinping issued a directive aimed at the sinicization of Chinese Muslims. Since then, the government has been accused of repressing aspects of Hui culture deemed \"Arab\". Most of these repressions have been limited to the removal of aesthetically Islamic buildings and symbols, with the government renovating architecture to appear more Chinese and banning Arabic signs in Hui regions. More drastic repressions have been taken, such as closing mosques or removing licenses from imams who have traveled outside of China. In order to sinicize the Hui, schools and mosques in Ningxia have been changed to include traits from traditional Han architecture.\n\nAt least two Hui Muslims have allegedly been included in reeducation camps, termed \"Vocational Education and Training Centers\" which the Chinese government claims are aimed at reforming the political thought of detainees, including extremist religious beliefs and separatist or terrorist sympathies. One or more of the Hui within these camps may have faced torture, and are allegedly grouped in different cells from Kazakhs and Uighurs, and on rare occasion die from stress.\n\n## Tensions between Hui and Uyghurs\n\nTensions between Hui Muslims and Uyghurs have arisen because Hui troops and officials often dominated the Uyghurs and crushed Uyghur revolts. Xinjiang's Hui population increased by more than 520 percent between 1940 and 1982, an average annual growth of 4.4 percent, while the Uyghur population only grew at 1.7 percent. This dramatic increase in Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur populations. Many Hui Muslim civilians were killed by Uyghur rebel troops in the Kizil massacre of 1933. Some Uyghurs in Kashgar remember that the Hui army at the Battle of Kashgar (1934) massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which causes tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China. Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries. Hui and Uyghur live separately, attending different mosques. During the 2009 rioting in Xinjiang that killed around 200 people, \"Kill the Han, destroy the Hui\" is a common cry spread across social media among Uyghur extremists.\n\nThe Uyghur militant organization East Turkestan Islamic Movement's magazine Islamic Turkistan has accused the Chinese \"Muslim Brotherhood\" (the Yihewani) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining militant jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the \"infidel Chinese\" language is the language of the Hui.\n\nEven among Hui Salafis (Sailaifengye) and Uyghur Salafis, there is little coordination or cooperation and the two have totally different political agendas, with the Hui Salafists content to carry out their own teachings and remain politically neutral.\n\nHui Muslim drug dealers are accused by Uyghur Muslims of pushing heroin onto Uyghurs. There is a typecast image in the public eye of Hui being heroin dealers.\n\n## Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence\n\nIn Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Antagonism between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule such as the Ngolok rebellions (1917–49) and the Sino-Tibetan War, but such hostility was suppressed after the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China. However, renewed Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out in the wake of the gradual liberalization of China, that resulted in increased movement of people, such as Han and Hui Chinese, into Tibetan areas. Muslim restaurants were attacked, and apartments and shops of Muslims were set on fire in the riot in mid-March 2008, resulting in death and injury. Tibetans also boycotted Muslim owned businesses. In August 2008, the main mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans during the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Some Muslims avoided overt display of religious identity in the wake of the violence. Many Hui Muslims also supported the repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government, complicating their relationship. Problems also exist between Chinese-speaking Hui and Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan-speaking Kache minority of Muslims).\n\n## Sectarian conflict\n\nThere have been many occurrences of violent sectarian fighting between different Hui sects, mostly dating from the Qing dynasty. Sectarian fighting between Hui sects led to the Jahriyya rebellion in the 1780s and the 1895 revolt. After a hiatus after the People's Republic of China came to power, sectarian infighting resumed in the 1990s in Ningxia between different sects. In recent years, the Salafi movement in China has increased rapidly among Hui population with more mosques occupied under Salafis in China. Several sects refuse to intermarry with each other. One Sufi sect circulated an anti-Salafi pamphlet in Arabic.\n\nA small but growing number of Huis who supported or even joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Chinese officials were believed to have ignored growing Hui Sufis' resentment against growing Salafi movement until recently. ISIL had released a music video called \"I am a mujahid\" (我們是Mujahid) in Mandarin to reportedly attract Hui Muslims into joining the organization.\n\n## Relations with other religions\n\nSome Hui believed that Islam was the true religion through which Confucianism could be practiced, superior to \"barbarian\" religions, and accused Buddhists and Daoists of \"heresy\", like most other Confucian scholars. Among the many Muslims in pre-Chinese Lhasa, the Kokonor Hui community was permitted to maintain the abattoirs outside the confines of the girdling pilgrims' circuit of the city.\n\nMuslim general Ma Bufang allowed polytheists to openly worship and Christian missionaries to station themselves in Qinghai. Ma and other high-ranking Muslim generals attended the Kokonuur Lake ceremony where the God of the Lake was worshipped, and during the ritual, the Chinese national anthem was sung, participants bowed to a portrait of Kuomintang party founder Sun Yat-sen, and to the God of the Lake. Offerings were given to Sun by the participants, including Muslims. Ma Bufang invited Kazakh Muslims to attend the ceremony. Ma Bufang received audiences of Christian missionaries, who sometimes preached the Gospel. His son Ma Jiyuan received a silver cup from the missionaries.\n\nThe Muslim Ma Zhu wrote \"Chinese religions are different from Islam, but the ideas are the same.\"\n\nDuring the Panthay Rebellion, the Muslim leader Du Wenxiu said to a Catholic priest: \"I have read your religious works and I have found nothing inappropriate. Muslims and Christians are brothers.\"\n\n## Mosques\n\nThe style of architecture of Hui mosques varies according to their sect. The traditionalist Gedimu Hanafi Sunnis, influenced by Chinese culture, build mosques which look like Chinese temples. The reformist modernist Yihewani, originally inspired by Salafism, build their mosques in a middle-eastern style.\n\n## Foot binding\n\nHui women once practiced foot binding, at the time a common practice across China. It was particularly prevalent in Gansu. The Dungan people, descendants of Hui from northwestern China who fled to Central Asia, also practised foot binding until 1948. However, in southern China, in Canton, James Legge encountered a mosque that had a placard denouncing footbinding, saying Islam did not allow it, since it violated God's creation.\n\n## Cultural practices\n\nFrench army Commandant Viscount D'Ollone reported in 1910 that Sichuanese Hui did not strictly enforce the Islamic practices of teetotaling, ritual washing and Friday prayers. Chinese practices like incense burning at ancestral tablets and honoring Confucius were adopted. One practice that was stringently observed was the ban on pork consumption.\n\nThe Sunni Gedimu and the Yihewani burned incense during worship. This was viewed as Daoist or Buddhist influence. The Hui were also known as the \"white capped\". Hui used incense during worship, while the Salar, also known as \"black capped\" Hui considered this to be a heathen ritual and denounced it.\n\nIn Yunnan province, during the Qing dynasty, tablets that wished the Emperor a long life were placed at mosque entrances. No minarets were available and no chanting accompanied the call to prayer. The mosques were similar to Buddhist temples, and incense was burned inside.\n\nHui enlisted in the military and were praised for their martial skills.\n\nCircumcision in Islam is known as khitan. Islamic scholars agree that it is required (mandatory), or recommended. However, circumcision is not universally practiced among the Hui. In the regions where it is undertaken, Hui tradition is that the maternal uncle (Jiujiu) play an important role by the circumcision and wedding of his nephew.\n\n## Names\n\nThe long history of Hui residence and mixing in China has led the Hui to adopt names typical of their Han neighbors; however, some common Hui names are actually Chinese renderings of common Muslim (i.e. Arabic) and Persian names. For instance, surname \"Ma\" for \"Muhammad\".\n\nHui people usually have a Chinese name and a Muslim name in Arabic, although the Chinese name is used primarily. Some Hui do not remember their Muslim names.\n\nHui people who adopt foreign names may not use their Muslim names. An example of this is Pai Hsien-yung, a Hui author in America, who adopted the name Kenneth. His father was Muslim general Bai Chongxi, who had his children adopt western names.\n\n## Surnames\n\nHui people commonly believe that their surnames originated as \"Sinified\" forms of their foreign Muslim ancestors some time during the Yuan or Ming eras. Common Hui surnames:\n\nA Ningxia legend states that four common Hui surnames—Na, Su, La, and Ding—originate with the descendants of Nasruddin, a son of Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar, who \"divided\" the ancestor's name (Nasulading, in Chinese) among themselves.\n\n## Literature\n\nThe Han Kitab is a collection of Islamic and Confucian texts written by various Hui authors in the 18th century, including Liu Zhi. New works were written by Hui intellectuals following education reform by Ma Clique warlords and Bai Chongxi. Some texts were translated from Arabic.\n\nA new edition of a book by Ma Te-hsin, called Ho-yin Ma Fu-ch'u hsien-sheng i-shu Ta hua tsung kuei Ssu tien yaohui, first printed in 1865, was reprinted in 1927 by Ma Fuxiang. General Ma Fuxiang invested in new editions of Confucian and Islamic texts. He edited Shuofang Daozhi, a gazette and books such as Meng Cang ZhuangKuang: Hui Bu Xinjiang fu.\n\n## Language\n\nThe Hui of Yunnan, whom the Burmese called Panthays, were reportedly fluent in Arabic. During the Panthay Rebellion, Arabic replaced Chinese as the official language of the rebel kingdom.\n\nPublished in 1844, The Chinese repository, Volume 13 includes an account of an Englishman who stayed in the Chinese city of Ningbo, where he visited the local mosque. The Hui running the mosque was from Shandong and descended from residents of the Arabian city of Medina. He was able to read and speak Arabic with ease, but was illiterate in Chinese, although he was born in China and spoke Chinese.\n\n## Marriage\n\nHui marriages resemble typical Chinese marriages except that traditional Chinese rituals are not used. Endogamy is practiced by Hui, who mainly marry amongst themselves rather than with Muslims from other sects. However, the Hui Na family in Ningxia is known to practice both parallel and cross cousin marriage. The Najiahu village in Ningxia is named after this family, descended from Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar.\n\n## Outside marriage\n\nIntermarriage generally involves a Han Chinese converting to Islam when marrying a Hui, and marriage without conversion only takes place rarely. In Hui discourse, marriage between a Hui woman and a Han man is not allowed unless the Han converts to Islam, although it occurred repeatedly in Eastern China. Generally Han of both sexes have to convert to Islam before marrying. This practice helped increase the population of Hui. A case of switching nationality occurred in 1972 when a Han man married a Hui and was considered a Hui after converting.\n\nZhao nuxu is a practice where the son-in-law moves in with the wife's family. Some marriages between Han and Hui are conducted this way. The husband does not need to convert, but the wife's family follows Islamic customs. No census data documents this type of marriage, reporting only cases in which the wife moves in with the groom's family. In Henan province, a marriage was recorded between a Han boy and Hui girl without the Han converting, during the Ming dynasty. Steles in Han and Hui villages record this story and Hui and Han members of the Lineage celebrate at the ancestral temple together.\n\nIn Beijing, Oxen street Gladney found 37 Han–Hui couples; two of which were had Hui wives and the other 35 had Hui husbands. Data was collected in different Beijing districts. In Ma Dian 20% of intermarriages were Hui women marrying into Han families, in Tang Fang 11% of intermarriage were Hui women marrying into Han families. 67.3% of intermarriage in Tang Fang were Han women marrying into a Hui family and in Ma Dian 80% of intermarriage were Han women marrying into Hui families.\n\nLi Nu, the son of Li Lu, from a Han Chinese Li family in Quanzhou visited Hormuz in Persia in 1376. He married a Persian or an Arab girl, and brought her back to Quanzhou. He then converted to Islam. Li Nu was the ancestor of Ming dynasty reformer Li Chih.\n\nIn Gansu province in the 1800s, a Muslim Hui woman married into the Han Chinese Kong lineage of Dachuan, which was descended from Confucius. The Han Chinese groom and his family were only converted to Islam after the marriage by their Muslim relatives. In 1715 in Yunnan province, few Han Chinese married Hui women and converted to Islam.\n\nJiang Xingzhou 姜興舟, a Han bannerman lieutenant from the Bordered Yellow Banner married a Muslim woman in Mukden during Qianlong's late reign. He fled his position due to fear of being punished for being a bannerman marrying a commoner woman. He was sentenced to death for leaving his official post but the sentence was commuted and he was not executed.\n\nIn the Dungan Revolt (1895–96) 400 Muslims in Topa 多巴 did not join the revolt and proclaimed their loyalty to China. An argument between a Han Chinese and his Muslim wife led to these Muslims getting massacred, when she threatened that the Muslims from Topa would attack Tankar and give a signal to their co-religionists to rise up and open the gates by burning the temples atop the hills. The husband reported this to an official and the next day the Muslims were massacred with the exception of a few Muslim girls who were married off to Han Chinese.\n\nIn the 21st century, Hui men marrying Han women and Han men who marry Hui women have above average education.\n\n## Education\n\nHui have supported modern education and reform. Hui such as Hu Songshan and the Ma Clique warlords promoted western, modern secular education. Elite Hui received both Muslim and Confucian education. They studied the Quran and Confucian texts like the Spring and Autumn Annals. Hui people refused to follow the May Fourth Movement. Instead, they taught both western subjects such as science along with traditional Confucian literature and classical Chinese, along with Islamic education and Arabic. Hui warlord Ma Bufang built a girls' school in Linxia that taught modern secular subjects. Hui have had female imams, called Nu Ahong for centuries. They are the world's only female Imams. They guide women in prayer but are not allowed to lead prayers.\n\n## Military service\n\nMuslims have served extensively in the Chinese military for a long time in Chinese history, as both officials and soldiers, often filling the more distinguished military positions. During the Tang dynasty, 3,000 Chinese soldiers and Arab 3,000 Muslim soldiers were traded to each other in an agreement. In 756, 3,000 Arab mercenaries joined the Chinese against the An Lushan rebellion. A mythical Hui legendary folklore account claims 3000 Chinese soldiers were swapped by Guo Ziyi with the Muslims for 300 \"Hui\" soldiers, and said that only 3 Hui survived the war against An Lushan and populated Ningxia. A massacre of thousands of foreign Arab and Persian Muslim merchants and other foreigners by former Yan rebel general Tian Shengong happened during the An Lushan rebellion in the Yangzhou massacre (760), The rebel Huang Chao's army in southern China committed the Guangzhou massacre against over 120,000 to 200,000 foreign Arab and Persian Muslim, Zoroastrian, Jewish and Christian merchants in 878–879 at the seaport and trading entrepot of Guangzhou.\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty, Hui generals and troops loyal to Ming fought against Mongols and Hui loyal to the Yuan dynasty in the Ming conquest of Yunnan. Hui also fought for the emperor against aboriginal tribes in southern China during the Miao Rebellions. Many Hui soldiers of the Ming dynasty then settled in Yunnan and Hunan provinces.\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, Hui troops in the Imperial army helped crush Hui rebels during the Dungan revolt and Panthay Rebellion. The Qing administration in Xinjiang also preferred to use Hui as police. Yang Zengxin, the Han Chinese governor of Xinjiang, extensively relied on Hui generals like Ma Shaowu and Ma Fuxing. Qing Muslim general Zuo Baogui (1837–1894), from Shandong province, was killed in Pingyang in Korea by Japanese cannon fire in 1894 while defending the city, where a memorial to him stands. Hui troops also fought western armies for the first time in the Boxer Rebellion, winning battles including the Battle of Langfang and Battle of Beicang. These troops were the Kansu Braves led by General Dong Fuxiang.\n\nMilitary service continued into the Republic of China period. After the Kuomintang party took power, Hui participation in the military reached new levels. Qinghai and Ningxia were created out of Gansu province, and the Kuomintang appointed Hui generals as military governors of all three provinces. They became known as the Ma Clique. Many Muslim Salar joined the army in the Republic era; they and Dongxiang who have joined the army are described as being given \"eating rations\" meaning military service.\n\nThe Chinese government appointed Ma Fuxiang as military governor of Suiyuan. Ma Fuxiang commented on the willingness for Hui people to become martyrs in battle (see Martyrdom in Islam), saying:\n\nThey have not enjoyed the educational and political privileges of the Han Chinese, and they are in many respects primitive. But they know the meaning of fidelity, and if I say \"do this, although it means death,\" they cheerfully obey.\n\nHui generals and soldiers fought for the Republic against Tibet in the Sino-Tibetan War, against Uyghur rebels in the Kumul Rebellion, the Soviet Union in the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang and against Japan in the Second Sino Japanese War. The Japanese planned to invade Ningxia from Suiyuan in 1939 and create a Hui puppet state. The next year in 1940, the Japanese were defeated militarily by Kuomintang Muslim general Ma Hongbin. Ma Hongbin's Hui Muslim troops launched further attacks against Japan in the Battle of West Suiyuan. The Chinese Islamic Association issued \"A message to all Muslims in China from the Chinese Islamic Association for National Salvation\" in Ramadan of 1940 during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\nWe have to implement the teaching \"the love of the fatherland is an article of faith\" by the Prophet Muhammad and to inherit the Hui's glorious history in China. In addition, let us reinforce our unity and participate in the twice more difficult task of supporting a defensive war and promoting religion... We hope that ahongs and the elite will initiate a movement of prayer during Ramadan and implement group prayer to support our intimate feeling toward Islam. A sincere unity of Muslims should be developed to contribute power towards the expulsion of Japan.\n\n\"Ahong\" is the Mandarin Chinese word for \"imam\". During the war against Japan, the imams supported Muslim resistance, calling for Muslims to participate in the fight against Japan, claiming that casualties would become shaheeds (martyrs). Ma Zhanshan was a Hui guerilla fighter against the Japanese.\n\nHui forces were known for their anti-communist sentiment, and fought for the Kuomintang against the CCP in the Chinese Civil War, and against rebels during the Ili Rebellion. Bai Chongxi, a Hui general, was appointed to the post of Minister of National Defence, the highest military position in the Republic of China. After the Communist victory and evacuation of the Kuomintang to Taiwan, Hui people continued to serve in the military of the Republic as opposed to the Communist-led People's Republic. Ma Bufang became the ambassador of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to Saudi Arabia. His brother, Ma Buqing, remained a military general on Taiwan. Bai Chongxi and Ma Ching-chiang were other Hui who served in Taiwan as military generals.\n\nThe PLA recruited Hui soldiers who formally had served under Ma Bufang, as well as Salafi soldiers, to crush the Tibetan revolt in Amdo during the 1959 Tibetan uprising.\n\n## Politics\n\nThe majority of the Hui Muslim Ma Clique Generals were Kuomintang party members and encouraged Chinese nationalism in their provinces. Kuomintang members Ma Qi, Ma Lin (warlord), and Ma Bufang served as military governors of Qinghai, Ma Hongbin served as military governor of Gansu, and Ma Hongkui served as military governor of Ningxia. General Ma Fuxiang was promoted to governor of Anhui and became chairman of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs. Ma Bufang, Ma Fuxiang, and Bai Chongxi were all members of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, which ruled China in a one-party state. Member Bai Chongxi helped build the Taipei Grand Mosque on Taiwan. Many members of the Hui Ma Clique were Kuomintang.\n\nHui put Kuomintang Blue Sky with a White Sun party symbols on their Halal restaurants and shops. A Christian missionary in 1935 took a picture of a Muslim meat restaurant in Hankou that had Arabic and Chinese lettering indicating that it was Halal (fit for Muslim consumption). It had two Kuomintang party symbols on it.\n\n## Increasing religiosity in China\n\nAccording to Dru Gladney, professor at Pomona College in California and a leading scholar on the Hui people, Hui Muslims are enjoying a resurgence in religiosity in China, and that the number of practising Muslims among the Hui people, are rising as well as a \"dramatic increase\" in the number of Hui women wearing the Hijab, and the numbers of Hui going on the Haj. There are also estimated twice as many mosques in China today than there were in 1950, in which majority were built by Hui Muslims.\n\nOne of the reasons for the trend in China, is that Hui Muslims play a vital role as being middlemen in trade between the Middle East and China, and the China-Middle East trade has become increasingly important to the country. Consequently, the government has started constructing a $3.7 billion Islamic theme park called \"World Muslim City\", in Yinchuan, one of Hui Muslims hubs. Additionally unlike Uyghurs, who faces far more restrictions in religious freedoms, Hui Muslims generally do not seek independence from China and have a cultural affinity to the Han, and are far more assimilated into mainstream Chinese life. \"It's not an issue of freedom of religion,\" says Gladney, \"Clearly, there are many avenues of religious expression that are unfettered in China, but when you cross these very often nebulous and shifting boundaries of what the state regards as political, then you're in dangerous territory. Obviously this is what we see in Xinjiang and in Tibet\".\n\n## Outside mainland China\n\nIn Southeast Asia, presence of Hui Muslims may date back 700 years to the time of Zheng He, who was a Hui. Hui people also joined the wave of Chinese migrants that peaked between 1875 and 1912. They inhabited Penang, Sabah, Singapore and Pangkor prior to World War II. Most were Hokkien-speaking coolies and merchants from Fujian. The colonial British welfare system was commissioned according to language groups, so the Hui were classed as Hokkien. A small number of Hui may have become assimilated into mainstream Chinese society and local Muslim populations. In 1975, five Hui leaders started a campaign to get every clansman to put up a notice listing their ancestors for 40 generations, as a way of reminding them of their origins. The exact Hui population is unclear today as many families left Islam before independence. In 2000 official census figures gave the number of Muslim Chinese in Malaysia as 57,000 but most were Han converts. According to the Malaysian Chinese Muslim Association, the surnames Koay, Ma, Ha, Ta, Sha, Woon, and An (or Ang) may indicate Hui ancestry.\n\nSaudi Arabia was settled by hundreds of Hui Muslim soldiers under Ma Chengxiang after 1949. The Hui General Ma Bufang settled permanently in Mecca in 1961. For a while Cairo was the dwelling place of Ma Bukang and Ma Bufang in between the time they were in Saudi Arabia. The death of Ma Jiyuan in Jeddah on 27 February 2012 was greeted with sorrow by the Chinese consulate.\n\nThe Panthays in Myanmar and some of the Chin Haw in Thailand are Hui Muslims, while Hui in Central Asia and Russia are called Dungans.\n\n## Ethnic tensions\n\nThe Dungan and Panthay revolts were set off by racial antagonism and class warfare, rather than religion. During the first Dungan revolt from 1862 to 1877, fighting broke out between Uyghur and Hui groups. In the military, imbalances in promotion and wealth were other motives for holding foreigners in poor regard.\n\nIn 1936, after Sheng Shicai expelled 20,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai, the Hui led by Ma Bufang massacred their fellow Muslims, the Kazakhs, until only 135 remained.\n\nThe Hui people have had a long presence in Qinghai and Gansu, or what Tibetans call Amdo, although Tibetans have historically dominated local politics. The situation was reversed in 1931 when the Hui general Ma Bufang inherited the governorship of Qinghai, stacking his government with Hui and Salar and excluding Tibetans. In his power base in Qinghai's northeastern Haidong Prefecture, Ma compelled many Tibetans to convert to Islam and acculturate. Tensions also mounted when Hui started migrating into Lhasa in the 1990s. In February 2003, Tibetans rioted against Hui, destroying Hui-owned shops and restaurants. Local Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders led a regional boycott movement that encouraged Tibetans to boycott Hui-owned shops.\n\nTensions with Uyghurs arose because Qing and Republican Chinese authorities used Hui troops and officials to dominate the Uyghurs and crush Uyghur revolts. Xinjiang's Hui population increased by over 520 percent between 1940 and 1982, an average annual growth of 4.4 percent, while the Uyghur population only grew at 1.7 percent. This dramatic increase in Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur populations. Many Hui Muslim civilians were killed by Uyghur rebel troops in the Kizil massacre (1933). Some Uyghurs in Kashgar remember that the Hui army at the 1934 Battle of Kashgar massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which caused tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China. Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries. Hui and Uyghur live separately, attending different mosques. During the 2009 rioting in Xinjiang that killed around 200 people, \"Kill the Han, kill the Hui\" was the recurring cry spread across social media among extremist Uyghurs.\n\n## See also\n\n* Chinese Muslims in the Second Sino-Japanese War\n\n* Dungan people\n\n* Hui Minorities' War\n\n* Hui pan-nationalism\n\n* Hui people in Beijing\n\n## Sources\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* (1st edition appeared in 1991)\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* Unknown year, Google summary has 2011, preview pages have 1997, Worldcat has eBook for the ISBN.\n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* This is an English translation by Louis J.

{"id": "77498764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zainab%20Abbas%20%28activist%29", "title": "Zainab Abbas (activist)", "text": "Zainab Abbas (born 1950) is a Black British activist working for women’s rights and social change, who has been a notable participant since the late 1960s and '70s in various key organisations of the UK black power movement, such as the Black Liberation Front, the British Black Panthers, and the Brixton Black Women's Group,\n\n## Biography\n\nAbbas was born in 1950, in Middlesbrough, in the north of England, to an Egyptian family of Nubian descent. Her mother had worked as a nurse in Palestine before leaving for reasons of safety because of the unrest there; as Abbas shared in an interview: \"Mother’s background was that she was raised in an orphanage in Egypt, and the good thing about being raised in an orphanage, probably the only good thing, was she got an education. So she was able to go to university and qualify as a nurse....\n\"She was brought to the UK by a major in the British army and his family....They were nice and just wanted to get her into Britain. She went down to London and there she met my dad. Then I know she worked in the health service as a nurse....\n\n\"I lost my father when I was very young. My mother raised five of the six of us, because my sister died, as a single parent. She was very inventive, I’ve had a great deal of respect all my life for my mother.\"\n\nAbbas has spoken of the effect the US Black Power movement had on her as a teenager; she was particularly impressed by hearing Stokely Carmichael speak in July 1967 at the Roundhouse in London, where she had hitchhiked to attend her first ever political meeting. She also recalls the impact of hearing James Brown's 1968 \"Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud)\", as well as being inspired by Malcolm X.\n\nIn 1971, she moved down to Birmingham, in the West Midlands, where she joined the Birmingham Black Panthers and taught in the black supplementary school system. Then, in 1971, she went to London, joining the Black Liberation Front (BLF). The organisation was affiliated with the International Panther network, and as the BLF's international secretary, Abbas liaised with the US Panthers, developing a lasting friendship with Kathleen Cleaver.\n\nIn 1973, Abbas joined with Gerlin Bean (whom she saw as a mentor), Beverley Bryan, Olive Morris, Liz Obi and other activists to found the Brixton Black Women's Group (BBWG), an influential and foundational Black feminist grouping.\n\nAbbas, together with Bean and Ansel Wong, was in the British delegation to the Sixth Pan-African Congress, which was hosted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in 1974.

{"id": "30160421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyrthosiphon%20pisum", "title": "Acyrthosiphon pisum", "text": "Acyrthosiphon pisum, commonly known as the pea aphid (and colloquially known as the green dolphin, pea louse, and clover louse), is a sap-sucking insect in the family Aphididae. It feeds on several species of legumes (plant family Fabaceae) worldwide, including forage crops, such as pea, clover, alfalfa, and broad bean, and ranks among the aphid species of major agronomical importance. The pea aphid is a model organism for biological study whose genome has been sequenced and annotated.\n\n## Generalities and life cycle\n\nIn the autumn, female pea aphids lay fertilized eggs overwinter that hatch the following spring. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs are all females, which undergo four moults before reaching sexual maturity. They will then begin to reproduce by viviparous parthenogenesis, like most aphids. Each adult female gives birth to four to 12 female nymphs per day, around a hundred in her lifetime. These develop into mature females in about seven to ten days. The life span of an adult is about 30 days.\n\nPopulation densities are at their highest in early summer, then decrease through predation and parasitism. In autumn, the lengthening of the night triggers the production of a single generation of sexual individuals (males and oviparous females) by the same parthenogenetic parent females. Inseminated sexual females will lay overwintering eggs, from which new parthenogenetic females will emerge in early spring.\n\nWhen the colony begins to become overcrowded, some winged females are produced. These disperse to infest other plants, where they continue to reproduce asexually. When temperatures become colder and day lengths shorter, sexual winged females and males appear. These mate, the females lay diapausing eggs and the life cycle starts again. Pea aphids can complete their whole reproductive cycle without shifting host plant.\n\nInbreeding is avoided by the recognition of close kin. Mating between close kin has significantly lower egg hatching success and offspring survival than outbred mating.\n\nSeveral morphs exist in pea aphids. Besides differences between sexual and parthenogenetic morphs, winged and wingless morphs exist. Overcrowding and poor food quality may trigger the development of winged individuals in subsequent generations. Winged aphids can then colonize other host plants. Pea aphids also show hereditary body color variations of green or red/pink. The green morphs are generally more frequent in natural populations.\n\nAcyrthosiphon pisum is a rather large aphid whose body can reach in adults. It generally feeds on the lower sides of leaves, buds and pods of legumes, ingesting phloem sap through its stylets. Unlike many aphid species, pea aphids do not tend to form dense colonies where individuals would stay where they were born during their whole lifetimes. Pea aphids are not known to be farmed by ants that feed on honeydews.\n\nMore than 20 legume genera are known to host pea aphids, though the complete host range remains undetermined. On crops such as peas and alfalfa, A. pisum is considered among the aphid species of major agronomical importance. Yields can be affected by the sap intake that directly weakens plants, although pea aphids seldom reach densities that might significantly reduce crop production. However, like many aphid species, A. pisum can be a vector of viral diseases to the plants it visits. Protection against pea aphids includes the use of chemical insecticides, natural predators and parasitoids, and the selection of resistant cultivars. No insecticide resistance is documented in A. pisum, as opposed to many aphid pests.\n\nPea aphids, although collectively designated by the single scientific name A. pisum, encompass several biotypes described as cryptic species, subspecies or races, which are specialized on different host species. Therefore, the pea aphid is more accurately described as a species complex.\n\nThe pea aphid is thought to be of Palearctic origin, but it is now commonly found worldwide under temperate climate. The spread of A. pisum probably resulted from the introduction of some of its host plants for agriculture. Such an introduction likely occurred into North America during the 1870s, and by 1900 it had become a serious pest species in the mid-Atlantic states. By the 1950s, it was widespread throughout the United States and Canada. Its host range in North America is very similar to that of the closely related blue alfalfa aphid (Acyrthosiphon kondoi).\n\n## Model organism\n\nA. pisum is considered as the model aphid species. Its reproductive cycle, including the sexual phase and the overwintering of eggs, can be easily completed on host plants under laboratory conditions, and the relatively large size of individuals facilitates physiological studies. In 2010, the International Aphid Genomics Consortium published an annotated draft sequence of the pea aphid genome composed of approximately 525 megabases and 34,000 predicted genes in 2n=8 chromosomes. This constitutes the first genome of a hemimetabolous insect to have been published. \nThe pea aphid genome and other of its features are the focus of studies covering the following areas:\n\n* Symbiosis with bacteria - As all Aphididae, A. pisum hosts the primary endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola, which provides essential amino acids and is necessary for aphid reproduction. Buchnera is transmitted from mothers to offspring, and it has coevolved with aphids for dozens of millions of years. A. pisum also hosts a range of facultative bacterial symbionts (Hamiltonella defensa, Serratia symbiotica, Regiella insecticola) that can be transmitted maternally and horizontally, and which affect ecologically important traits in aphids, such as body color, resistance to abiotic and biotic stress, and nutrition. (Specifically, Hamiltonella defensa and Serratia symbiotica retard the development of parasitoid wasps, and Regiella insecticola decreases mortality due to Pandora neoaphidis)\n\n* Polyphenism (the production of several discrete morphs by the same genotype) - Studies on pea aphids have helped to establish the environmental and genetic components controlling the production of sexual and winged morphs, among other features.\n\n* Asexual reproduction - Pea aphid lineages include parthenogenesis in their life cycles, and some have even lost the sexual phase. Pea aphids are models for deciphering the origin and consequences of asexual reproduction, an important question in evolutionary biology.\n\n* Polymorphism and physiology explaining phenotypic variations in aphids - Loci and physiological mechanisms underlying body color, reproductive cycle and the presence of wings in males (which is genetically based) have been identified in pea aphids or are being investigated. A. pisum is notable as one of few animals identified to synthesize carotenoids. Plants, fungi, and microorganisms can synthesize carotenoids, but torulene (3',4'-didehydro-β,γ-carotene, specifically a hydrocarbon carotene) made by pea aphids, is one of few carotenoids known to be synthesized by animals. Torulene imparts natural, red-colored patches to some aphids, which possibly aid in their camouflage and escape from predation by wasps. The aphids have gained the ability to synthesize torulene by horizontal gene transfer of a number of genes for carotenoid synthesis, apparently from fungi.\n\n* Gene duplication and expansion of gene families - The pea aphid genome presents high levels of gene duplication compared to other insect genomes, such as Drosophila, with the notable expansion of some gene families.\n\n* Interaction with host plants and speciation - As most phloem feeders, the pea aphid is adapted to feeding on a limited set of plants. Studies on pea aphids have identified candidate loci, molecular and physiological mechanisms that are involved in host nutrition and virulence. Genetic, molecular and physiological studies have also evidenced specialization to different host species as a motor of ecological speciation between pea aphid biotypes.\n\n## Endosymbiotic relationship with ''Buchnera aphidicola''\n\nA. pisum participates in an obligate endosymbiotic relationship with the bacteria Buchnera aphidicola. A. pisum is the host and Buchnera is the primary endosymbiont. Together they form the holosymbiont. This is an obligate, symbiotic relationship and both partners are completely dependent on each other. When treated with antibiotics to remove the Buchnera bacteria, A. pisum growth and reproduction are interrupted or reduced. Buchnera lacks genes required for living independent of a host and is unculturable outside of the aphid host. The A. pisum and Buchnera holosymbiont is one of the most well studied symbiotic relationships both genetically and experimentally.\n\n## Evolution of the endosymbiotic relationship\n\nThe A. pisum and Buchnera endosymbiotic relationship is likely to have evolved 160-280 million years ago. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Buchnera is a monophyletic group and that the phylogenies of Buchnera and A. pisum coincide. Therefore, there was likely one original Buchnera infection of the common ancestor of aphids and co-speciation of the holosymbiont has occurred since then. Buchnera is related to Enterobacteriaceae including Escheriachia coli and it is likely that Buchnera evolved from a bacterium that originally occupied the gut of the aphid common ancestor.\n\n## Nutritional symbiosis\n\nLike other insects of the order Hemiptera, A.pisum utilizes an endosymbiotic bacterium to overcome the nutritional deficiencies of phloem sap. A. pisum feeds on phloem sap of host plants including Medicago sativa (alfalfa), Pisum sativa (pea), Trifolium pretense (red clover), and Vicia faba (broad bean). The phloem saps of these plants are nutritionally rich in carbohydrates but poor in terms of nitrogen. The ratio of essential amino acids to nonessential amino acids in these phloem saps ranges from 1:4-1:20. This ratio of essential to nonessential amino acids is severely disproportional compared to the 1:1 ratio present in animal tissues and necessary for survival. \n\nAnimals, including A. pisum, can produce nonessential amino acids de novo but cannot synthesize nine essential amino acids that must be obtained through their diets: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. In addition to these nine essential amino acids, A. pisum is unable to synthesize arginine due to missing urea cycle genes. The endosymbiotic relationship with Buchnera allows A. pisum to overcome this lack of essential amino acids in the phloem sap \n\nWhen provided with nonessential amino acids, Buchnera converts nonessential amino acids into essential amino acids to be returned to A. pisum. This nutritional provisioning has been examined genomically (metabolic complementary, discussed below) and experimentally. Isolated bacteriocytes containing Buchnera have been shown to actively take up 14C labeled glutamine (a nonessential amino acid) where it is then converted into glutamic acid. This glutamic acid is then taken up by the individual Buchnera cells and used to synthesize the essential amino acids isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, and valine as well as nonessential amino acids that can be returned to A. pisum. Mutual nutrient provisioning is likely the main reason for the persistence of this symbiosis.\n\n## Holosymbiont structure\n\nBuchnera are housed in specialized, aphid-derived cells located in the hemocoel of the A. pisum body cavity. Each Buchnera cell has an inner and outer gram-negative cell membrane and is individually enclosed in an aphid-derived symbiosomal membrane. These encased cells are then grouped into specialized, aphid-derived bacteriocytes (mycetocytes). Bacteriocytes are large, polyploid cells surrounded by a thin lining of flat sheath cells. There are about 60-80 bacteriocytes in each pea aphid and are organized into the bi-lobed bacteriome.\n\nA bacteriome is a specialized organ that runs along the length of the pea aphid on two sides of the body and joins near the hindgut. Bacteriocytes are located near the ovariole cluster and Buchnera cells are vertically transferred from the mother's ovaries through transovarial transmission. The Buchnera cells are transferred to eggs during oogenesis or to the developing embryos during embryogenesis.\n\n## Genome sequencing\n\nA. pisum and Buchnera were the first insect-endosymbiont pair to have the genomes of both partners sequenced. This has provided researchers with a great deal of information about the evolutionary and molecular interactions of this endosymbiosis. The A. pisum and Buchnera genomes have experienced unique modifications that are likely related to the establishment and maintenance of the endosymbiotic relationship. The genomes of both organisms have undergone significant gene loss compared to related organisms. The Buchnera genome is 641-kb and consists of a circular chromosome with 2 plasmids. It has been reduced to one-seventh of the size of its closest free-living relative, E. coli. \n\nBuchnera has lost genes that would allow it to live outside the host but maintains genes essential for the nutrition of A. pisum. The Buchnera genome is missing genes required for surface membrane construction such as lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids as well as genes associated with cellular defense. Transporter genes and regulatory genes are also missing from the genome. Such gene loss is typical of an obligate and intracellular bacterium.\n\nThe A. pisum genome has undergone more unique genomic changes compared to other insects of the order Hemiptera. The aphid genome is 464MB with aphid-specific orphan genes making up 20% of the genome and gene duplication present in more than 2000 gene families. These orphan genes and gene duplications are likely associated with the “metabolic, structural and developmental” components of the endosymbiotic relationship. A. pisum specific gene duplications of amino acid transporters highly expressed in bacteriocytes have been observed. These duplications are likely associated with the genetic establishment and maintenance of the endosymbiotic relationship.\n\nNo lateral gene transfer has been detected between A. pisum and Buchnera. It was previously believed that lateral gene transfer was responsible for the severe gene reduction in the Buchnera genome but sequencing has shown that this has not occurred.\n\n## Metabolic complementarity\n\nIndividually, the metabolic pathways of A. pisum and Buchnera are incomplete. Jointly, the genomes of these two organisms complement each other to produce complete metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of nutrients such as amino acids and other essential molecules. The ancestral partners of this symbiosis are likely to have had complete metabolic pathways, however pressure to maintain these pathway genes was reduced due to redundancy as a result of the presence of the other partner's genome. Unlike other related insects, the A. pisum genome is missing genes necessary for the urea cycle. the purine salvage pathway, and other genes that code enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of molecules. \n\nThese missing reaction intermediates are likely provided by genes within the Buchnera genome. For example, A. pisum is the only species with a sequenced genome known to be missing key components of the purine salvage pathway, essential for the production of DNA, RNA, signaling molecules, and ATP. The Buchnera genome contains the necessary genes to encode the reaction intermediates missing from the A. pisum genome. Through this complementation, the nucleotide requirements of both organisms are fulfilled: the purine salvage pathway is completed for A. pisum and Buchnera receives necessary guanosine.\n\nThe Buchnera genome has retained genes required for the biosynthesis of essential amino acids but has not retained genes responsible for the degradation of amino acids. The A. pisum genome on the other hand, contains 66 amino acid biosynthesis genes and 93 amino acid degradation genes. Both A. pisum and Buchnera contribute to the metabolic pathways of amino acid biosynthesis. This metabolic complementarity is illustrated by the use of asparagine, a nonessential amino acid in phloem sap, as a major precursor in the production essential and nonessential amino acids necessary for the growth and survival of A. pisum and Buchnera.\n\n## Immune system\n\nGenome sequencing of A. pisum shows that the genome lacks expected genes essential to immune response pathways. The A. pisum genome lacks IMS, dFADD, Dredd and Retish genes that are a part of the IMD (immunodeficiency) pathway and present in other related insects. Also missing are peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) that detect pathogens and alert the IMD pathway as well as antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes which are produced once the immune pathway has been activated. A reduced immune system may have facilitated the establishment and sustained maintenance of the symbiotic relationship between the Buchnera bacterium and A. pisum. Also, phloem sap is a diet with reduced amounts of microbes which may have lower the evolutionary pressure of A. pisum to maintain the immune response pathway genes.\n\n## Pests, diseases, and biocontrols\n\nA. pisum faces threats from parasitoid wasps and the fungal pathogen Pandora neoaphidis. As such these are also promising potential biocontrols.\n\n## References\n\nMacrosiphini\nAgricultural pest insects\nInsect pests of temperate forests\nInsect pests of ornamental plants\nInsect vectors of plant pathogens\nInsects described in 1776\nHemiptera of Africa\nTaxa named by Moses Harris"}

And in that year, Andik presented gold medals to the city of Surabaya in the Provincial Sports Week.\n\nIn 2008, Andik had a big role in bringing home the gold medal for East Java at National Sports Week, which was held in Kalimantan.\n\n## Persebaya\n\nAndik joined Persebaya after a successful trial. He succeeded in the trial due to his immense potential and ability. After joining the club, he continued working hard and impressed many with his pace and dribbling ability and eventually broke into Persebaya's first team. And at the age of 17, he was one of the youngest players in the squad at the time. He made his official debut for Persebaya on 29 August 2008, coming on in the 77th minute in a 2-0 victory against Persekabpas Pasuruan.\n\n## Overseas trials\n\nIn October 2011, Serie A Giant Inter Milan was interested in him. On 7 September 2012, Andik joined Major League Soccer side D.C. United on trial and played several times for their reserve team but did not sign a contract with them and eventually returned to Persebaya .\n\nOn 6 October 2013 following a trial in Ventforet Kofu, in his debut he scored a goal in a reserves match against Shimizu S-Pulse. His performance made headlines in Japanese newspapers and impressed the 2,000 supporters in attendance.\n\n## Selangor\n\nOn 1 December 2013, Andik joined Malaysia Super League side Selangor on a two-years contract. He chose Selangor because they offered him a bigger salary than the salary offered by the J1 League side, Ventforet Kofu. His salary ( rumoured $150,000/yr.) would make him one of the best paid Indonesian athletes.\n\nAndik made his first Selangor debut in the 2014 Malaysia FA Cup in a 0–2 win against Harimau Muda C on 22 January 2014. On 25 March, Andik scored his first league goal in the 2014 Malaysia Super League for Selangor in a 2–0 victory over Sarawak at the Sarawak State Stadium.\n\nAndik helped Selangor FA to become the Runner-Up in the 2014 Malaysian Super League and he's one of the main reason Selangor FA managed to reach that far for the 2014 and 2015 Malaysian Super League Season. Andik also appeared as one of the Malaysian Super League Players who made one of the most assist for the 2014 Malaysian Super League Season before signing a new contract with Selangor FA for the 2015 Malaysian Super League Season to continue help Selangor FA win more cups and achievements for the 2015 Season.\n\nAndik also holds the second fastest goal record in the Malaysia Super League history which the goal is as early as the 28th second during a match against Johor Darul Ta'zim FC. While the fastest goal was scored by Ahmad Fakri Saarani who scored during the 12th second and holds the 6th place in the world's fastest goal record.\n\nAndik has expanded his contract with Selangor FA until 2017 worth 3 billion Rupiah's making him the most paid footballer in Indonesia.\n\n## Kedah\n\nOn 9 February 2018, Andik signed a contract with another Malaysia Super League side Kedah. He has been given jersey number 30. Andik made his league debut in a 1–0 win against PKNP on 11 February 2018. On 22 June 2018, Andik scored his first league goal for Kedah against Kuala Lumpur as his team won 3–2.\n\n## Madura United\n\nOn 24 December 2018, Andik signed a contract with Liga 1 side Madura United. Andik made his Madura United debut in the first leg Round of 32 2018–19 Piala Indonesia against Cilegon United on 29 February 2019. and he also scored his first goal for the team in a 2–0 victory over Cilegon United at the Gelora Madura Stadium, he scored in the 66th minute.\n\nAndik made his first Liga 1 appearance on 17 May 2019, coming on as a starter in a 1–5 win with Persela Lamongan at the Surajaya Stadium. On 24 May 2019, Andik scored his first goal for Madura United in a 0–1 victory over Barito Putera at the 17th May Stadium. During his career at Madura United, he made 24 league appearances and scored 2 goals for Madura United.\n\n## Bhayangkara\n\nIn 2020, Andik signed a one-year contract with Indonesian Liga 1 club Bhayangkara. Andik made his league debut in a 1–1 draw against Persik Kediri on 6 March 2020. And then, this season was suspended on 27 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The season was abandoned and was declared void on 20 January 2021.\n\nOn 29 August 2021, he started his match in the 2021–22 Liga 1 season for Bhayangkara in a 2–1 win over Persiraja Banda Aceh, he coming as a substitute for Renan Silva in the 80th minute.

{"id": "311666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool%20Lime%20Street%20railway%20station", "title": "Liverpool Lime Street railway station", "text": "Liverpool Lime Street is a terminus railway station and the main station serving the city centre of Liverpool. Opened in August 1836, it is the oldest still-operating grand terminus mainline station in the world. A branch of the West Coast Main Line from London Euston terminates at the station, as does the original Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Journeys from Lime Street cover a wide range of destinations across England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nHaving realised that their existing Crown Street railway station was too far away from the city centre, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway commenced construction of the more central Lime Street station in October 1833. Designed by John Cunningham, Arthur Holme and John Foster Jr, it was officially opened in August 1836. Proving to be very popular with train commuters, expansion of the station had become necessary within six years of its opening. The first expansion, which was collaboratively produced by Joseph Locke, Richard Turner, William Fairbairn and John Kennedy, was completed in 1849 at a total cost of £15,000 (). During 1867, work upon a further expansion of Lime Street station commenced, during which time the present northern arched train shed was built. Designed by William Baker and Francis Stevenson, the train shed was the largest such structure in the world upon completion, featuring a span of , as well as the first to make extensive use of iron. During 1879, a second parallel southern train shed was completed.\n\nFollowing the nationalisation of the railways in 1948, Lime Street station was the subject of various upgrades and alterations, including new signalling systems in and around the station, a redeveloped concourse, and new retail and office spaces. In 1962, regular electric services between Lime Street and Crewe were officially started and, in 1966, the station hosted the launch of its first InterCity service, which saw the introduction of a regular service between Liverpool and London. During the 1970s, a new urban rail network known as Merseyrail was developed, while all other long-distance terminal stations in Liverpool were closed, resulting in such services being centralised at Lime Street for the whole city. In October 2003, the Pendolino service operated by Virgin Trains West Coast was ceremonially unveiled at the station, introducing a faster service between Liverpool and London. In May 2015, the electrification of the former Liverpool and Manchester Railway route was completed, as well as the line to Wigan via St Helens Central.\n\nLime Street station is fronted by a large building designed in the Renaissance Revival style, the former North Western Hotel, which served as a hotel, office and student accommodation and now back to a hotel as the Radisson Red Liverpool Hotel. The hotel opened in December 2022.\n\nSince the 1970s, the main terminal building has also provided direct access to the underground Lime Street Wirral Line station on the Merseyrail network. Beginning in the 1960s, the Concourse House office tower block and several retailers stood outside the southern train shed, but they were demolished in 2010. Lime Street is the largest and oldest railway station in Liverpool; it is one of 18 stations managed by national infrastructure maintenance company Network Rail. During 2017, work commenced at Lime Street station on a £340 million remodelling programme. In Britain's 100 Best Railway Stations, written by columnist and editor Simon Jenkins, Lime Street Station was one of only ten stations to be awarded 5/5 stars.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe original terminus of the 1830 Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR) was located at Crown Street, in Edge Hill, to the east of and outside the city centre. However, even before Edge Hill had been opened, it was apparent that there was a pressing need for another station to be built, which would this time be closer to the city centre. Accordingly, during October 1833, the construction commenced on a purpose-built station at Lime Street in the city centre; the land was purchased from Liverpool Corporation for £9,000 (). The means of connecting the new station to L&MR's network came in the form of a twin-track tunnel, which had been constructed between Edge Hill and the site of the new Lime Street station a year prior to work being started on the station itself; during the construction effort, the tunnel was frequently used to transport building materials for the station onto the site. The station was designed by the architects John Cunningham, Arthur Holme, and John Foster Jr.\n\nDuring August 1836, Lime Street Station was officially opened to the public, although the construction process was not completed until the following year. This building was designed with four large gateways, two of which were intentionally nonfunctional. For its early operations, as a consequence of the steep incline uphill from Lime Street to Edge Hill, trains would be halted at Edge Hill and the locomotives detached from the trains; the practice of the era was for the passenger carriages to be taken down by gravity, during which the rate of descent would be controlled by brakemen located in a brake van. The return journey was achieved via the use of a stationary steam engine located at Edge Hill, which would be used to haul the carriages up to Edge Hill by rope. This system was constructed by the local engineering firm Mather, Dixon and Company, who worked under the direction of the engineer John Grantham. During 1870, this practice came to an end; instead, trains would enter and depart the station by conventional means.\n\n## Early expansion\n\nLime Street Station was a near-instant success with the railway-going public. Within six years of its opening, the rapid growth of the railways had necessitated the expansion of the original station. An early plan for the enlarged station would have involved the erection of an iron roof, similar to that found at Euston station (pre 1960's rebuilding) in London, which was a ridge roof supported by iron columns. However, a different proposal quickly gained the approval of the station committee. A single curved roof was produced by a collaborative effort; designed and load tested by engineer Joseph Locke, with construction contracted to iron founder Richard Turner, and the work checked by engineer William Fairbairn and manufacturer John Kennedy. The expansion work was performed at a cost of £15,000 () and was completed during 1849, by which time the noted architect William Tite had also been involved. Meanwhile, during 1845, the L&MR had been absorbed by its principal business partner, the Grand Junction Railway (GJR); the following year the GJR became part of the London and North Western Railway. Amongst the features which date back to the 1846–1849 rebuild of the station are a group of four columns which adjoin former Platform 1, they have been attributed to engineer Edward Woods.\n\nBy 1857, a pair of granite columns had been erected outside the station entrance; over time, these had become known as the \"Candlesticks\". During 1867, further expansion of Lime Street Station was required to cope with operational demands; changes included the present northern arched train shed. Designed by William Baker and Francis Stevenson the train shed featured a span of , leading to it being recognised as the largest such structure in the world at the time. It was also the first train shed in which iron was used throughout. During 1879, a second parallel southern train shed was completed, which had been designed by Stevenson and E.W. Ives. This second train shed featured dry construction techniques, while each bay reportedly took only three days to build.\n\nLime Street Station is fronted by a large building, built in the Renaissance Revival style, which formerly housed the North Western Hotel. Designed by Alfred Waterhouse, the building was built during 1871 and served as student accommodation for Liverpool John Moores University from 1996. It was announced on 28 September 2018 that the building will be restored as a hotel by the Marcus Worthington Group at a cost of £30m. It will reopen as the Radisson RED Liverpool Hotel in 2020.\n\nAs a result of the Railways Act 1921, which grouped the majority of railway companies together to create the Big Four, Lime Street Station passed into the ownership of the newly formed London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) railway. The station played an early role in the development of mail trains, the Post Office first dispatched mail by train from Lime Street.\n\n## British Rail era\n\nUpon nationalisation of the railways during 1948, Lime Street Station became a part of the London Midland Region of British Railways. On 28 January 1948, a new signal box controlling movements in and around Lime Street was commissioned; this signal box would remain in use for almost 70 years, being one of the last lever frames boxes still in operation by the time of its decommissioning during 2017–2018. During 1955, the station concourse was redeveloped and modernised. During 1959, preparatory work commenced at Lime Street for the first stage of the electrification of the West Coast Main Line. On 1 January 1962, regular electric services between Lime Street and Crewe were officially started.\n\nThe railway lines to former platforms 10 and 11 were removed by 1965. On 18 April 1966, the station hosted the launch of its first InterCity service, which saw the introduction of a regular service between Liverpool and London. On 11 August 1968, the Fifteen Guinea Special, a return service to Carlisle, was hauled by the Black Five locomotive 45110 from Liverpool to and back. Arriving back at Lime Street at 7:58 pm, this train marked the end of British Railways' final steam-hauled mainline passenger journey.\n\nAn office tower block named Concourse House, along with a row of small retail outlets, used to stand outside the southern train shed, obscuring the arches. These dated from the 1960s, and by the 2000s had become run down. They were demolished as part of a comprehensive refurbishment completed in 2010.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a new urban rail network, known as Merseyrail was developed, resulting in four terminus stations being taken out of use in Liverpool and Birkenhead centres. As a consequence of this restructuring and rationalization, only Lime Street remained as a terminus, thus serving as a central point for the whole region for medium- and long-haul routes. At the same time, the Merseyrail network provided commuters with ease of access across the whole Merseyside region to the one remaining large terminus.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1984, the station concourse was again altered and refurbished at a total estimated cost of £7.4 million. This refurbishment included the construction of the black glass building which partially surrounds platforms inside the northern train shed, as well as the glass screen which separates the concourse from platforms inside the southern train shed. The alterations also coincided with the opening of the International Garden Festival. On 29 November 1984, the new development was officially opened by Princess Anne.\n\n## Privatisation era\n\nOn 20 October 2003, the new Pendolino service operated by private rail operator Virgin Trains, which introduced a faster service between Liverpool and London, was ceremonially unveiled in the presence of the company's founder and chief executive officer Richard Branson. Designed from the onset to be a tilting train, it quickly replaced much of the previously-allocated locomotives and rolling stock used on the West Coast Main Line, namely the British Rail Class 86, 87 and 90 electric locomotives and Mark 2 and Mark 3 coaching stock. Prior to this, the fleet had been first introduced into passenger services from Birmingham International to Manchester Piccadilly on 23 July 2002 to coincide with the opening of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.\n\nTo help celebrate several high-profile occasions, such as Liverpool's role as European Capital of Culture during 2008, and the city's 800th anniversary in 2007, a £35 million redevelopment grant was issued for the station and its immediate surroundings. The Lime Street Gateway Project saw the demolition of the aging retail parade and office block located in front of the station, and an improved frontage and public plaza constructed in its place. Subsequently, Lime Street was voted Station of the Year 2010 at the National Rail Awards. The development was overseen by English Partnerships and was completed in October 2010.\n\nThe main concourse features a pair of statues of comedian Ken Dodd and politician Bessie Braddock, a work entitled \"Chance Meeting\" by sculptor Tom Murphy, which were unveiled by Ken Dodd himself during June 2009. On 31 August 2014, the Earl of Wessex unveiled a memorial to the Liverpool Pals at the station. The memorial, which comprises two bronze friezes, was also sculpted by Tom Murphy. During 2014, former Platforms 1–5 were fully refurbished by national rail infrastructure maintenance company Network Rail.\n\n## Electrification to Manchester and Wigan\n\nCompletion of electrification of the former Liverpool and Manchester Railway's route, and the line to Wigan via St Helens Central, during May 2015 led to a recast of timetables. This included the introduction of a brand new TransPennine Express service to Newcastle via Manchester Victoria, running alongside the existing service to via and . It was unclear whether suitable electric rolling stock would be available in time for the completion of the work, but it was confirmed during April 2014 that electric trains would be available to operate the new electric services, and the first trains were introduced from March 2015, initially on the service to , with services to , and following over the course of the year.\n\n## 2017 wall collapse\n\nAt around 17:45 on 28 February 2017, the station was cut off after a wall collapsed into the cutting between Lime Street and Edge Hill, causing more than 200 tonnes of debris to fall onto all four of the tracks running into the throat of the station. While the line was blocked, Virgin trains terminated at Runcorn and other trains terminated at Liverpool South Parkway. The debris was cleared up, with repairs made to the overhead wires, and the station reopened just over a week later on 8 March 2017.\n\n## 2017–18 station remodelling\n\nDuring 2017, work commenced upon a £340 million remodelling programme intended to improve Lime Street Station by modernising its signalling systems, install new platforms, and other to better conform with current demands. A major impetus for the work was the age of the station's signalling, the core of which dated from the 1940s and was increasingly difficult to acquire knowledgeable staff for its operation and maintenance; furthermore, as resignalling of the existing station layout offered only slightly less work than the implementation of an entirely fresh layout, only without the benefits of being able to do so, it was decided to take the rare occasion as a convenient chance to make various alterations and improvements at the same time. Perhaps the most noticeable change made for the perspective of passengers was the creation of an additional pair of platforms, which were built in the large space available between Platforms 7 and 8 (now 6 and 9); all of the other platforms were also lengthened and widened as a part of this work.\n\nAccording to industry publication Rail Engineer, the old layout of the station was relatively complex and posed some operational difficulties; many of the alterations sought to ease or eliminate some of these issues. As the curving of Platform 6 (now 5) had been a source of long-term driver difficulty in maintaining signal sightings, the platform was reprofiled to be straighter, permanently ending the problem. The new layout provides five platforms on each side of the station; beyond being simpler, the change facilitates the departure speed being increased from 15 to 25 mph and is also compatible with being maintained by modern mechanised equipment. In conjunction with the layout changes, new Mk3D overhead line equipment was installed along the route between Lime Street station and Edge Hill. Control of the signalling was transferred over to the centralised Manchester Rail Operating Centre.\n\nThe remodelling of Lime Street had been deemed necessary in order to provide the capacity for additional services to Glasgow, which are set to start during 2019. Various new retail outlets, along with a supermarket, were also established by work performed during the programme. To accommodate the work, the station was mostly closed over a twenty-three day period, which started on 30 September 2017; during the latter stages of this blockade, limited services ran to/from Huyton and some destinations beyond this. The station closed from 2 June 2018 to 29 July 2018 to allow more of the remodelling to be undertaken.\n\n## Station layout\n\nLiverpool Lime Street is divided into two sections: the mainline station, which offers national inter-city and regional overground services including local City Line routes, and services on the Wirral Line on the Merseyrail network, located underground between the mainline station and St George's Hall.\n\n## Mainline station\n\nThe mainline station is covered by the vast iron and glass roofs dating from the 1870s. The north train shed is fronted by a 1871 French Château styled building occupied by the Radisson RED Liverpool Hotel. The hotel is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nPlatforms 1 to 5 are shorter than 6 to 10, the latter dealing mainly with long-distance services to London, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield and Norwich. Access to platforms 1–5 is through a ticket inspection barrier similar to airport passport control, while former platform 7 was gated with the creation of new shops and facilities. Former Platforms 8 and 9 were still \"open\".\n\nIn 2009, new buildings were erected in the old \"cab road\" area between former platforms 7 and 8. Until the 2018 station remodelling, these housed customer lounges, the Virgin Trains customer service point, and an ATM, and there were retail units which had coffee shops amongst the units.\n\nThere were also four non-passenger tracks. Three of these were headshunts, created in the northern trainshed to turn locomotives around: Track A, in between former platforms 1 and 2; track B, serving former platforms 3 and 4; and track D, for former platforms 5 and 6. There is also a platform with no passenger service between former platforms 6 and 7, known as platform E, or sometimes affectionately as platform 6¾.\n\n## Facilities\n\nToilets, booking offices, shops, a left-luggage office, taxi ranks and coffee bars are amongst the facilities provided. The main booking office is operated by Northern Trains. The concourse of the station contains several shops, including branches of M&S Simply Food, Starbucks, Upper Crust, Krispy Kreme, Costa Coffee, Boots and WHSmith. Car parking is managed by APCOA. The station also has two taxi ranks.\n\n## Public transport links\n\nThe station has direct bus services to the Liverpool One bus station on the 10A and 18 route, from the bus station for Liverpool John Lennon Airport use services 86A (frequent & night services) and 500. The bus services are provided by Arriva North West\n\n## Services\n\nThe main station is currently served by six train operating companies serving a wide variety of destinations. Services out of Lime Street () are as follows:\n\n## East Midlands Railway\n\nEast Midlands Railway operate an hourly service to Norwich via Warrington Central, Manchester Piccadilly, Sheffield, Nottingham and . Late afternoon and evening services terminate or start at Nottingham.\n\n## TransPennine Express\n\nTransPennine Express currently operate two trains per hour on their North Route via the Chat Moss line to , continuing to and , and one train per hour on their South Route via to , and continuing to via . Additionally, there are two trains per day to via the West Coast Main Line.\n\n## London Northwestern Railway\n\nLondon Northwestern Railway currently operate an hourly service to via , calling at the local stations between and .\n\n## Northern\n\nNorthern is the main train operating company at Lime Street, operating the ticket office. Services include:\n\n* 1 train per hour to via , and \n\n* 1 train per hour to via (semi-fast to Warrington Central)\n\n* 1 train per hour to (stopping)\n\n* 2 trains per hour to via \n\n* 1 train per hour to via , ,\n\n## Avanti West Coast\n\nAvanti West Coast operate an hourly Pendolino service to London Euston calling at Runcorn, and Milton Keynes Central (peak services call additionally at Stafford, Lichfield Trent Valley, Tamworth, Nuneaton, Rugby, and Watford Junction).\n\n## Transport for Wales\n\nTransport for Wales operate an hourly service to Chester via Runcorn, using the Halton Curve with daily extensions to Wrexham General in the evening peak.\n\n## CrossCountry Trains Consultation 2018\n\nThe Department for Transport's 2018 consultation on the future of the CrossCountry franchise, which was due for renewal in 2019 but was later cancelled in September 2018 but cited Liverpool as a potential new destination for CrossCountry train service. If adopted this may restore some of the services lost in 2003. The Consultation closed in August 2018. Despite the cancellation of the competition, the consultation responses will be used to help develop options for the future of the franchise so Liverpool may be considered as a potential destination in the future.\n\n## Long Term Rail Strategy Proposals\n\nIn a long term rail strategy by Merseytravel, new direct services to Cardiff, Bristol, Leicester, Derby, Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley have been proposed.\n\n## Virgin Trains Open Access Proposal\n\nIn June 2019, Virgin Trains lodged an application for an open access service from to Liverpool Lime Street calling at , , , and Liverpool Lime Street to rival the future West Coast Partnership franchise Avanti West Coast from December 2022.\n\n## West Coast Partnership\n\nIn August 2019, it was announced that Avanti West Coast would operate the West Coast Partnership franchise from December 2019. As part of the award, the new operator will look at providing up to two trains per hour between Liverpool Lime Street and from December 2022, subject to approval by the Office of Rail and Road.\n\n## Future Northern and TransPennine Franchises\n\nIn November 2018, it was revealed by Transport for the North several options for the future Northern and TransPennine franchise. Some options for Liverpool include extension of Liverpool to Crewe services towards Stoke-on-Trent and Alsager, increasing Liverpool to Blackpool North services and a new Liverpool to Leicester service via Crewe, Stoke-on-Trent, Uttoxeter and Derby. The Leicester service could be operated by either TransPennine Express or the future East Midlands Franchise.\n\n## TransPennine Franchise Agreement\n\nAs part of the TransPennine Express (TPE) franchise agreement (awarded to FirstGroup which started services in April 2016), there will be three new direct services per day to Glasgow Central via Preston along the West Coast main line. The current hourly TPE Newcastle route was extended via to Edinburgh Waverley in December 2019.\n\nIn 2005 Renaissance Trains proposed a twice-daily service from Lime Street to Glasgow Central, with weekend trains running instead from Blackpool to Glasgow. The proposal did not get enough investment backing, but was revived in 2014.\n\n## Chester, Wales and Shrewsbury via the Halton Curve\n\nThe completion of the upgrade of the Halton Curve in 2018 provides a second rail route between Liverpool and Chester, and permits the introduction of new direct services from Liverpool to Wrexham, Llandudno and other parts of North Wales. \nAs part of the new Wales & Borders franchise services to Chester were introduced in May 2019 with future services to Llandudno and Shrewsbury every hour and services to Cardiff every two hours planned.\n\n## London Euston\n\nIt was also proposed that by 2016 London Midland would also operate an hourly service to London Euston (as an extension of its existing Trent Valley semi-fast service), however, this was rejected by the Office of Rail Regulation. . From May 2019 to December 2019, its successor London Northwestern Railway operated a London to Liverpool service via Birmingham New Street.\n\n## Northern Franchise Agreement\n\nAs part of the Northern franchise agreement (awarded to Arriva, which started in April 2016), from December 2019 there will be a new \"Northern Connect\" service to Leeds via Manchester Victoria and Bradford Interchange (replacing the current all-stations local service to Victoria). This is the first time there is a direct service through to Rochdale, Halifax and Bradford Interchange since the timetable change on 10 December 2006 when Northern terminated all services at Manchester Victoria.\n\n## Underground station\n\nThe underground station consists of a single platform (sometimes referred to as Platform L), alongside the 1970s Liverpool Loop tunnel and a ticket hall above. The station, opened in 1977, is connected to the mainline station by means of a pedestrian subway and escalators, accessed via a long passageway which crosses beneath Lime Street itself, and by a lift from the main concourse.\n\n## 2013 refurbishment\n\nNetwork Rail announced in early 2013 that Lime Street was to be the third station to be refurbished as part of the £40 million investment which would see all Merseyrail underground stations excluding Conway Park refurbished. This included the refurbishment of the platform and the booking hall. The station refurbishment work took place between April and August 2013.\n\n## Subway refurbishment\n\nThe subway linking the underground station to the mainline station was refurbished in June 2014.

{"id": "41503898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoist%20temple", "title": "Taoist temple", "text": "A Daoist temple (), also called a () or (), is a place where the Dao is observed and cultivated. It is a place of worship in Taoism. Taoism is a religion that originated in China, with the belief in immortality, which urges people to become immortal through moral and health cultivation.\n\nStructure and function can vary according to the Daoist school the temple belongs to. For example, guàn of the Quanzhen School are monasteries where celibate daoshi \"priests\" live.\n\n## History\n\nDuring the Southern Dynasty, under the influence of Buddhist monasteries, monasticism became the new trend, and Taoists were also trying to create a new way of monasticism by emulating the model set by Buddhists. Therefore, many of the Taoist houses were built in a similar pattern to Buddhist monasteries. Although its scale cannot be compared to the Buddhist monasteries, their form and pattern are similar, including the courtyard-like layout, the hall-like architecture, and the enshrining statues. Moreover, large Taoist temples also function as an economic entity, which is also similar to Buddhism. The official Taoist temple has magnificent buildings and different offerings, with halls, statues, gardens, and even industries. It also contains different building spaces for different purposes, for example, the medicine garden and orchard, ponds, and gardens for trees and flowers.\n\nThe Taoist temple is a place for Taoists to practice, so monasticism is closely related to where the temple is built. Taoists are asked to cultivate virtues, and believe monasticism can help them get rid of hardship and troubles and lead to a peaceful life. Taoists aim to find a state of tranquility in the psychological and spiritual world. Therefore, monasticism was put in the highest place in Taoism.\n\n## Environment\n\nThere are many ways to practice Taoism, such as praying, keeping thoughts, nurturing, and internal elixir and external elixir. But no matter what practices they are engaged in, adherents need quiet and inaction. Therefore, temple locations require quiet and freedom from the disturbance of the outer world. To be far away from the noisy and busy cities, most Taoist temples are built in deep forests to practice monasticism. Even though there are Taoist temples in the city, most of them are located in quiet and open spaces like mountains and forests, which is also similar to Buddhist temples.\n\n## Types\n\nThe palaces of a Taoist temple have two natures: one is the descendant temple (), and the other is the jungle temple ().\n\nThe descendant temples are passed down from generation to generation, from master to disciple, and the temple property can be inherited by an exclusive sect. Taoists from other sects can live in the temple temporarily but cannot interfere with temple affairs. Usually, the new disciples live in the descendant temple.\n\nThe jungle temples are not allowed to take in new disciples, and the temple property cannot be inherited and belongs to all Taoist congregations in the world in common. Inspired by Zen Buddhism, Taoism also gradually shifted from the Tang Dynasty to emphasize inner purification and inaction and heavy metaphysics. The Quanzhen school also established the Jungle system of Taoism with reference to the Zen forest system. Jungle temples are generally non-sectarian, and all Taoist Dharma have the right to live in and manage temple affairs. Generally, regardless of age, gender, or duration of monasticism, any Taoist who can reside in it has the right to be elected as the top leader. Taoists who have lived in the jungle temple for a long time are called permanent Taoists. There is a clear division of labor in the temple, commonly known as the “three masters, five masters, and eighteen heads,” who are in charge of sutra teaching, merit-making, security, fasting, staff placement, self-support, cooking, and other matters. Generally, the new disciples first learn this knowledge in the descendant temple, and after three years, they get the crown scarf and permission from the master; then, they can go to the jungle temple to live alone and learn more. After the study, they return again.\n\nIn addition, the sect is not determined by which temple the monk leaves home in. Rather, it is decided by the dharma descent, who grants the sect name according to the sect. And after that, wherever one goes, it is the same sect, and one can also live in the temple of descendants or in the jungle temple, as long as it is suitable. Generally, the temple where a new monk lives is the temple of his own sect, but not absolutely, as a rule. After having a master, if an adherent meets a better Taoist priest, they can worship “teacher” again, and don't have to change their descent. The Yellow Emperor studied the Tao and had 72 “masters.” There is only one Taoist master, but Taoists believe the more masters you can have, the better, because it means you are diligent and good at learning.\n\n## See also\n\n* Dambana\n\n* Taoism\n\n* Way of the Celestial Masters\n\n* Zhengyi Taoism\n\n* Quanzhen Taoism\n\n* Chinese ritual mastery traditions\n\n* Chinese temple\n\n* Cebu Taoist Temple (Cebu City, Philippines)"}

She helped to set up the women's section of the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain in Côte d'Ivoire and Upper Volta, becoming its secretary general in 1948. In 1958, she was appointed Upper Volta's Minister of Social Affairs, probably making her the first woman to join a cabinet in any of the French-speaking West African governments.\n\n## Biography\n\nOuezzin Coulibaly was believed to have been born sometime during 1910–1914 in the Banfora region of today's Burkina Faso, then known as Upper Volta. Known at birth as Makoukou (or Macoucou) Traoré, she was the daughter of Balla Traoré, who was chief of the Sindou Canton. Her education culminated in a teaching diploma. In 1930, she married Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly, obtaining the name Célestine in 1931 when she and her husband were baptized as Roman Catholics.\n\nShe helped to set up the women's section of the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain in Côte d'Ivoire and Upper Volta, becoming its secretary general in 1948. Ouezzin Coulibaly was one of those who led some 1,500 women in a march to the prison at Grand-Bassam on 24 December 1949, calling for the release of their husbands who, as members of the PDCI-RDA independence movement, had been jailed without trial by the French colonial authorities. \n\nTogether with fellow leaders Anne-Marie Raggi, Marguérite Sacoum, Odette Yacé and Marie Koré, she can therefore be considered one of the pioneers of the independence of the Ivory Coast.\n\nOn 24 October 1958, Ouezzin Coulibaly was appointed Upper Volta's Minister of Social Affairs, Housing and Employment. Her appointment, the first for a woman in French West Africa, seemed to be a promising development. It was not, however, quite as revolutionary as it might have seemed as it occurred only six weeks after the death of her husband, who had been President of the Council in Upper Volta. Although his death probably played an important part in her appointment, as a trained schoolteacher and one of the country's few literate women, she was in fact fully qualified for the position.\n\nAfter she left the position in 1959, despite becoming the first female member of the national assembly, the fact that she did not obtain a government post after Upper Volta's independence in 1960 could be considered a backward step for the political role of women. Representing Upper Volta, Ouezzin Coulibaly was elected to the senate of the French Community on 30 April 1959 where she sat on the Committee for Transport and Telecommunications. She held the position until 16 March 1961.\n\n## References\n\n1910s births\n1997 deaths\n20th-century women politicians\nBurkinabé independence activists\nDate of birth unknown\nGovernment ministers of Burkina Faso\nMembers of the National Assembly of Burkina Faso\nPeople from Cascades Region\nWomen government ministers of Burkina Faso"}

{"id": "311794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark%20Light%20Rail", "title": "Newark Light Rail", "text": "The Newark Light Rail (NLR) is a light rail system serving Newark, New Jersey, and surrounding areas, owned by New Jersey Transit and operated by its bus operations division. The service consists of two segments, the original Newark City Subway (NCS), and the extension to Broad Street station. The City Subway opened on May 26, 1935, while the combined Newark Light Rail service was officially inaugurated on July 17, 2006.\n\n## Newark City Subway\n\nThe Newark City Subway is the longer and older of the two segments. It is a \"subway–surface\" line which runs underground from Penn Station to Warren Street, and above-ground north of Warren Street. Before becoming a part of the Newark Light Rail service, it was also known as the #7-City Subway line, an NJT Bus Operations route number carried over from its days when it was part of Public Service's Transport of New Jersey subsidiary. The number still applies internally. During subway system closures, replacement buses would also bear the route number \"7 City Subway\".\n\nThe segment is long and runs between Grove Street in Bloomfield and Newark Penn Station, a major transportation hub with connections to the PATH rapid transit system to Manhattan, multiple bus routes, and both Amtrak and New Jersey Transit Rail Operations trains.\n\n## History\n\nThe line opened in 1935 along the old Morris Canal right-of-way, from Broad Street (now known as Military Park) to Heller Parkway (now replaced by the nearby Branch Brook Park station). Works Progress Administration artists decorated the underground stations with Art Deco scenes from life on the defunct Morris Canal. The southernmost part, south of Warren Street, was capped with a new road, known as Raymond Boulevard. Only one grade crossing was present on the original subway; the line crosses Orange Street at grade so it can pass over the below-grade Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (now NJT Morristown Line) immediately to the north. The original Newark City Subway line had its own right-of-way and did not share city streets with local traffic, except at the Orange Street grade crossing.\n\nOperation of the complete subway to the newly built Penn Station was delayed until 1937. The terminal below Penn Station has five tracks, two incoming and three outgoing, connected by two loop tracks. This part of the subway included a grade-separated junction with a connection to the lower level of the Newark Public Service Terminal that was used for only a few months (June to September).\n\nAn extension to a wooden station at North 6th Street or Franklin Avenue was opened in 1940, located north of the present Branch Brook Park station. In 1953 the line was cut back about one block to accommodate construction of a turning loop, and a new station, still called Franklin Avenue, was opened adjacent to Anthony Street. The station was enlarged in 2002 and renamed Branch Brook Park.\n\nThe subway was operated by Transport of New Jersey (formerly Public Service Coordinated Transport) as its No. 7 line. Other streetcar routes used parts of the subway, reaching street trackage at the locations shown below, ending as each route was closed and replaced by bus service:\n\n* Public Service Terminal connection (and Cedar Street Subway), 1937 only: #13 Broad, #17 Paterson, #27 Mount Prospect, #43 Jersey City\n\n* Warren Street ramp, 1935–1951: #21 Orange—West Orange via Market Street\n\n* Central Avenue ramp, 1935–1947: #23 Central\n\n* Orange Street crossing, 1935–1952: #21 Orange—West Orange via Orange Street\n\n* Bloomfield Avenue ramp, 1935–1952: #29 Bloomfield\n\nUntil June 5, 1952, the Roseville Car House, on the south side of Main Street (on the No. 21 line) near the eastern city line of East Orange, was used for the No. 7 line. From that time until 2002, Newark Penn Station was used for storage and maintenance. A new shops and yard complex opened at the end of the extension to Grove Street.\n\nStarting in January 1954, 30 PCC streetcars bought from Twin City Rapid Transit provided all service on the route. They were single-ended, requiring construction of a new turning loop at the Franklin Avenue terminal. The cars had been built 1946–1949 by the St. Louis Car Company and were sold by TCRT when that system went through a conversion to buses. Four cars were scrapped over the years, and two were sold to Shaker Heights Rapid Transit in 1978.\n\nNew Jersey Transit took over operations in 1980.\n\nIn 2001, new light rail cars built by Kinki Sharyo in Japan in 1999 replaced the PCCs. The last day of PCC service was August 24, 2001.\n\nSome of the PCCs are stored in the Newark City Subway shop. Eleven were sold in 2004 to the San Francisco Municipal Railway for use on its F Market heritage streetcar line. One PCC, #15, was delivered to the Connecticut Trolley Museum in 2013 for restoration and display. One of the Shaker Heights cars has been restored by the Minnesota Transportation Museum, which operates it on a short stretch of track in western Minneapolis.\n\nIn 2005, eight PCCs were given to the City of Bayonne to be rehabilitated and operated along a proposed loop to serve the Peninsula at Bayonne Harbor, formerly Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne (MOTBY). The proposed line would be connected to the 34th Street station of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail.\n\nOn September 4, 2004, Broad Street Station was renamed Military Park Station, to avoid confusion with the terminal of the new route to the Newark Broad Street Station at University Avenue, operated by New Jersey Transit.\n\n## Bloomfield extension\n\nOn June 22, 2002, the Newark City Subway was extended to the suburbs of Belleville and Bloomfield along what had been the former Erie Railroad Orange Branch, now under Norfolk Southern ownership. New stations were opened at Silver Lake and Grove Street, and the Heller Parkway and Franklin Avenue stations were combined into a new Branch Brook Park station. The loop at Franklin Avenue was removed, since the new vehicles are bidirectional, unlike the old PCCs. A new loop, however, is in place at the Grove Street facility. All the street crossings on the extension are at-grade.\n\n## Shared-track operation\n\nThe original agreement gave sole operating privileges to Norfolk Southern between 11 pm and 5 am daily, but a new agreement allows passenger service to operate at all hours, with late-night service commencing on January 8, 2005. In exchange, Norfolk Southern can now operate during all off-peak hours, when passenger trains are infrequent.\n\n## Broad Street Extension\n\nThe Broad Street Extension is the second segment of the Newark Light Rail. It was planned as the first phase of the Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link. The line is long and connects Newark Penn Station to Broad Street Station. It branches off the older City Subway using the existing junction that had led to the Public Service terminal.\n\nA new tunnel leads from the junction to a portal about two blocks north. The remaining section runs above ground. For a few blocks, the two tracks run on different streets a block or two apart. Both tracks serve the New Jersey Performing Arts Center at Center Street. The outbound track makes stops at Atlantic Street and at the Riverfront Square development (formerly a baseball stadium) at the Riverfront Stadium station. The inbound track makes a stop at Washington Park. The extension opened on July 17, 2006.\n\nConstruction began in 2002 with an estimated cost of $207.7 million, or about $40,000 per foot of track; it was completed within budget. Projections were for 4,000 average weekday boardings after one year, growing to about 7,000 in 2010. Actual weekday boardings in 2010 for both Newark Light Rail lines combined were reported at 9,000.\n\nThe art work at the new stations has a common theme, \"Riding with Sarah and Wayne.\" It is a tribute to Newark-born jazz greats Sarah Vaughan and Wayne Shorter, and includes the lyrics to Vaughan's signature song, \"Send in the Clowns,\" and colored bricks representing the music notes.\n\nThe Broad Street Extension was intended to ease connections between Newark's two rail stations. The two separate stations are a legacy of their roots in two separate railroads. Broad Street Station was once owned by the Lackawanna Railroad and its successor, the Erie Lackawanna Railway, while Penn Station was built and owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Previously, passengers wanting to transfer between Amtrak and the former PRR/Conrail commuter lines and the former (Erie) Lackawanna commuter lines had to make their own way (usually by taxi or bus) between the two stations.\n\n## Fares\n\nThe Newark Light Rail is equivalent to a one-zone bus ride: a one-way ticket costs $1.80 (as of July 1, 2024), and is valid on the entire system for one hour after the ticket is validated. A special $0.85 \"Underground\" fare is available for trips that use only the subway between Warren Street and Penn Station, not the surface portion. Through-ticketing is available for connecting bus routes. Monthly and weekly NJ Transit bus and rail passes valid for one or more local bus zones, as well as transfers purchased on buses, are also accepted.\n\nThe Newark Light Rail, like most light rail systems in the United States, operates on a proof-of-payment system, in which riders must present their tickets upon request during random fare inspections by police officers, transit workers, or fare agents. Passengers must purchase tickets at ticket vending machines (TVMs) located on station platforms or near station entrances. The tickets can also be purchased via the New Jersey Transit mobile app. One-way, round-trip, and ten-trip tickets must then be validated, either by the app or with paper tickets, through automated validators located near the TVMs, which stamp the date and time on the ticket for 60 minutes of use. NJ Transit's fare inspectors randomly check tickets on trains and at stations; fare evasion carries a fine of up to $100. On the PCC streetcars, cash fares (exact fare) were paid on board via farebox, except for a brief period starting in October 1999 prior to the introduction of LRVs, when proof-of-payment fare collection was instituted.\n\n## Broad Street Extension\n\nAll stations are in Newark.\n\nOn weekdays, service operates separately between the two sections. On weekends, service operates jointly.\n\n## Rolling stock\n\nThe Newark Light Rail system uses a new-model vehicle built by Kinki Sharyo of Japan. This model is the same one used by the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system, although the ones used on the Newark Light Rail were built with slight modifications to the trucks and wheels due to the different rails used. Like the HBLR vehicles, the NLR vehicle is a double-articulated vehicle with three sections. Each of the two end sections has an operator's cab at the far end, thus eliminating the need for the vehicle to turn itself around physically in order to reverse direction. Each end section also has seating for 16 passengers on an upper level, and seating for 13 passengers on the lower level, including one special fold-down seat next to an empty space that a passenger using a wheelchair may use. With these two sections, and a middle section that seats ten passengers (five on each side), the vehicle can comfortably accommodate 68 seated passengers and two wheelchairs. An additional 122 passengers could stand in the vehicle, if necessary. Vehicles can be coupled into two-unit sets. A contract to expand 10 of the 20 LRVs assigned to the Newark Light Rail system for the purpose of increasing passenger capacity was approved on July 9, 2014.\n\nThe Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, ME acquired PCC #5 in 2011. The car represents the first piece of NJT rolling stock in the museum's collection. The car is currently undergoing restoration and rehabilitation work so that it may operate on the museum's -mile demonstration railway. Car #5 joins the museum's already-extensive collection of PCC cars from numerous cities, including Boston, Pittsburgh, Dallas, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Kansas CIty.\n\n## Timeline\n\n* December 22, 1910: The Public Service Corporation first announces plans to build the subway, initially including a line under Broad Street from Bridge Street to Clinton Avenue\n\n* October 3, 1934: The subway opens from Broad Street to Heller Parkway.

{"id": "6958600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantelegraph", "title": "Pantelegraph", "text": "The pantelegraph (Italian: pantelegrafo; French: pantélégraphe) was an early form of facsimile machine transmitting over normal telegraph lines developed by Giovanni Caselli, used commercially in the 1860s, that was the first such device to enter practical service. It could transmit handwriting, signatures, or drawings within an area of up to .\n\n## Description\n\nThe pantelegraph used a regulating clock with a pendulum which made and broke the current for magnetizing its regulators, and ensured that the transmitter's scanning stylus and the receiver's writing stylus remained in step. To provide a time base, a large pendulum was used weighing , mounted on a frame high. Two messages were written with insulating ink on two fixed metal plates; one plate was scanned as the pendulum moved to the right and the other as the pendulum moved to the left, so that two messages could be transmitted per cycle. The receiving apparatus reproduced the transmitted image by means of paper impregnated with potassium ferricyanide, which darkened when an electric current passed through it from the synchronized stylus. In operation the pantelegraph was relatively slow; a sheet of paper , with about 25 handwritten words, took 108 seconds to transmit.\n\nThe most common use of the pantelegraph was for signature verification in banking transactions.\n\n## History\n\nWhile employed teaching physics at the University of Florence, Giovanni Caselli devoted much time to research into the telegraphic transmission of images. The major problem of the time was to get perfect synchronization between the transmitting and receiving parts so they would work together correctly. Caselli developed an electrochemical technology with a \"synchronizing apparatus\" (regulating clock) to make the sending and receiving mechanisms work together that was far superior to any technology Bain or Bakewell had.\n\nBy 1856, he had made sufficient progress for Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany to take an interest in his work, and the following year he travelled to Paris where he was assisted by the engineer Paul-Gustave Froment, to whom he had been recommended by Léon Foucault, to construct the first pantelegraph. In 1858, Caselli's improved version was demonstrated by French physicist Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel at the French Academy of Sciences in Paris.\n\nOn 10 May 1860 Napoleon III visited Froment's workshop to observe a demonstration of the device, and was so enthused by the device that he secured access for Caselli to the telegraph lines he needed to further his work, from Froment's workshops to the Paris Observatory. In November 1860 a telegraph line between Paris and Amiens was allotted to Caselli which enabled a true long-distance experiment, which was a complete success, with the signature of the composer Gioacchino Rossini as the image sent and received, over a distance of . The composer wrote a piece, allegretto ‘del pantelegrafo’, for piano, marking the event.\n\nThe first \"pantelegram\" was sent from Lyon to Paris on 10 February 1862. The Corps législatif later ordered the installation of the pantelegraph on the railway line between the two cities, and from February 1863 the public was able to use it. French law was enacted in 1864 for the pantelegraph facsimile system to be officially accepted. The next year in 1865 the operations started with the Paris to Lyon line and extended to Marseille in 1867.\n\nRussian Tsar Alexander II installed an experimental service between his palaces in Saint Petersburg and Moscow between 1864 and 1865. \nIn 1867 the Director of Telegraphs, de Vougy, had a second line set up from Lyon to Marseille; the transmission cost was 20 centimes per square centimetre of image, and the service was operated until 1870.\n\n## Surviving machines\n\nThere are few remaining examples of the original pantelegraph. A formidable display of the pantelegraph was mounted in 1961 at the Musée National des Techniques, when a centennial celebration of the device was performed between Paris and Marseille.

{"id": "1684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso%20IV%20of%20Aragon", "title": "Alfonso IV of Aragon", "text": "Alfonso IV (2 November 1299 – 24 January 1336), called the Kind (also the Gentle or the Nice, ), was King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona (as Alfons III) from 1327 to his death. His reign saw the incorporation of the County of Urgell, Duchy of Athens, and Duchy of Neopatria into the Crown of Aragon.\n\n## Biography\n\nAlfonso was born in Naples, the second son of James II and Blanche of Anjou. In 1314, aged 14, he married Teresa d'Entença y Cabrera, heiress of Urgell, who was the same age as him. Teresa's granduncle Ermengol X of Urgell had died childless in La Llitera; before his death, he had agreed to make Alfonso his heir, on condition that Alfonso would marry Teresa, who was his nearest kin. Alfonso was at this time only the second son (and not the heir) of the king of Aragon. He and his father readily agreed to Ermengol's condition, and Alfonso married Teresa in 1314 in the Cathedral of Lerida. The teenage bridegroom is reputed to have been so liberal in the expenses during the wedding, that the local counsels imposed restrictions on how much he could spend. Alfonso and Teresa became the parents of seven children.\n\nAlfonso became heir to the throne in December 1319 after his older brother James renounced his rights to become a monk. During the reign of his father, Alfonso was the procurator-general of the Crown, and in 1323–1324, he undertook the conquest of Sardinia.\n\nAlfonso's father and first wife Teresa died within a few days of each other in 1327. Teresa died in childbirth on 20 October 1327, and James II died on 2 November 1327, whereupon Alfonso became king. In 1329, he began a long war with the Republic of Genoa. The city of Sassari had previously surrendered to Alfonso in 1323, but rebelled three more times; its possession was contested by Genoa, which led to the protracted war.\n\nIn February 1329, Alfonso married Eleanor of Castile (1308–1359), the sister of king Alfonso XI of Castile. Eleanor had been briefly married to Alfonso's elder brother James the monk. That marriage, which James had refused to consummate, had been annulled in 1319–20. Eleanor had thereafter retired to a convent (although she never took the veil) and had remained unmarried. By December the same year, the couple were rejoiced to become the parents of a son, Ferdinand, who was followed five years later by another son, John.\n\nEleanor earnestly sought to advance the interests of her own infant sons over those of her stepson, the Infante Peter, who was the heir-apparent. She convinced her husband to grant very large and significant territories to her sons. on 28 December 1329, Alfonso granted his new-born son Ferdinand the Marquisate of Tortosa and the cities of Albarracín, Orihuela, Callosa d'en Sarrià, Guardamar, Alicante, Monforte, Elda, La Mola, Novelda and Aspe. Eleanor's younger son John, who was born five years later, was also granted several lordships when he was only a toddler: Elche, Biel and Bolsa were all bestowed upon him. These territories would be controlled by Eleanor, who had also received the city of Huesca and some other villages and castles belonging to the Aragonese crown at the time of her wedding. Nor was this all. While all of the above grants had been made from among the possessions of the Aragonese crown, the King also sought to bestow estates located within the Kingdom of Valencia upon the toddler Ferdinand, but he was prevented from doing so. When the King granted Ferdinand the cities of Xàtiva, Alzira, Sagunto, Morella, Burriana and Castellón de la Plana, all located in the Kingdom of Valencia, the local subjects protested, and for this reason the King decided to revoked these patents. These grants of land diminished the territorial patrimony of the crown and mainly affected the Infante Peter, Alfonso's son by his first wife, who however was too young to make any significant protest. However, the issue agitated the court, created a climate of resentment and divided the nobility into two camps.\n\nAlfonso died in January 1336, aged only 36. He was succeeded by Peter IV, his 16-year-old son from his first marriage.\n\n## Children\n\nBy Teresa d'Entença:\n\n* Alfonso (1315–1317)\n\n* Constance (1318–1346), married in 1336 to James III of Majorca.\n\n* Peter IV (1319–1387), successor.\n\n* James I, Count of Urgell (1321–1347), also inherited Entença and Antillon.\n\n* Elizabeth (1323–1327).\n\n* Frederick (1325-died young).\n\n* Sancho (1327), lived only a few days.\n\nBy Eleanor of Castile:\n\n* Ferdinand (1329–1363), Marquis of Tortosa and Lord of Albarracín and Fraga; married Maria, Marchioness of Tortosa and was killed by order of his brother Peter IV.\n\n* John (1331–1358), Lord of Elche, Biel and Bolsa, married in 1355 to Isabel Núñez de Lara (daughter of Juan Núñez III de Lara) and was killed by order of his cousin Pedro of Castile.\n\n## Sources\n\n* Diccionario universal de historia y de geografía, p. 152.

{"id": "10721011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon%20Drolet", "title": "Leon Drolet", "text": "Leon Drolet (born January 9, 1967) is a Michigan Republican politician and Anti-tax activist elected Macomb County Commissioner. He is a political activist known for his conservative fiscal views, which have caused criticism from politicians from both sides, including Candace Miller, L. Brooks Patterson and Mark Hackel. From 2001 to 2006, Drolet served in the Michigan House of Representatives. Drolet also served as a Macomb County, Michigan county commissioner from 1999 to 2000 and from 2006 to 2008. Drolet was active in the Southeast Michigan Tea Party Movement.\n\n## Michigan Civil Rights Initiative chairmanship\n\nIn the 2006 election, he acted as statewide Chair of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative. The Michigan Civil Rights Initiative used the petition process to place a state constitutional amendment (Proposal 2 of November 2006) before voters that prohibits governments in Michigan from discriminating against, or giving preferential treatment to, any citizen on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of government hiring, contracting, or state university admissions. The amendment was approved by 58% of voters despite the fact that proponents were heavily outspent in the campaign by opponents who supported race-based government preference programs.\n\n## Eminent domain reform\n\nDuring his final term in the state legislature, Drolet co-authored a state constitutional amendment that prohibited governments in Michigan from using their power of eminent domain to seize citizens' private property and turn it over to new owners for their private use. This proposed amendment was Proposal 4 in the November 2006 election and was overwhelmingly adopted by voters.\n\n## Michigan Taxpayers Alliance recall effort\n\nAfter serving his final term in the Michigan state House, Drolet founded the Michigan Taxpayers Alliance, which he currently serves as chairman. In 2008, Drolet served as Treasurer of Michigan Recalls, which sought the recalls of several state legislators for their votes in favor of income and business tax increases during Michigan's budget crisis in 2007.\n\nAfter a highly acrimonious petition drive and numerous local and federal court battles, Drolet was obtained the needed signatures to force a recall election against the Speaker of the Michigan House, Andy Dillon (D-Redford Twp.).The prolonged court battles, however, had the effect of postponing the recall election from the targeted August 2008 primary ballot to the November 2008 general election ballot. Speaker Dillon won the recall vote by a significant margin and was reelected to office.\n\n## Case law\n\nLegal disputes over petition irregularities cited in challenges by Representative Dillon lead to the case of Bogaert v. Land. In the ruling, United States District Judge Robert Holmes Bell agreed with recall supporters that part of Michigan's law governing recall signature gathering was unconstitutional because it infringed on political speech rights protected in the First Amendment. Bell ruled that signatures from voters inside Dillon's district should be counted even if they were collected by petition circulators who lived outside the district or weren't registered to vote. Under Michigan law, those signatures were not previously considered valid.\n\n## Award\n\nDrolet received the 2008 Defender of Liberty Award from the Libertarian Party of Michigan. Drolet's work on the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, eminent domain reform, the Andy Dillon Recall effort, and legislation he authored relating to third-party ballot access were cited as reasons for the award.\n\n## 2010 State Senate campaign\n\nIn 2010, Drolet ran for an open state senate seat in Michigan's heavily-Republican 11th district. The GOP primary pitted Drolet against incumbent state representative Kim Meltzer and former state representative Jack Brandenburg, and was widely portrayed by media as the most contentious primary in the state (political newsletter Gongwer News described the race as, \"The Macomb County Chainsaw Massacre\"). Drolet was attacked by opponents for his vote against placing a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage on the 2006 ballot and for his opposition to the drug war. Meltzer mailed literature to voters accusing Drolet of introducing legislation to legalize \"gay sex in public\" and Drolet sued Meltzer for libel. Brandenburg won the primary and was elected to the senate seat, Drolet finished second and Meltzer placed third. Meltzer and Drolet settled the libel suit when Meltzer issued a public apology for her campaign's untrue allegations against Drolet and paid Drolet an undisclosed sum of money.\n\n## Arizona's Proposal 107 management\n\nAfter his senate primary defeat, Drolet became campaign manager for Arizona's Proposal 107—a proposed constitutional amendment on the November, 2010 state ballot. Proposal 107 would prohibit governments in Arizona from employing affirmative action policies that discriminate against, or grant preferences to, any individual or group based on race, ethnicity or gender in government hiring, contracting, or public university admissions. Arizona voters passed Proposal 107 by a 59.5% to 40.5% margin.\n\n## Defeat of 2016 RTA millage\n\nIn 2016, after defeating incumbent Macomb County Commissioner Joseph Sabatini in the August Republican primary election, Drolet led the campaign to defeat a millage initiative to fund the Regional Transit Authority of Southeast Michigan on the November ballot. The proposal would increase property taxes in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, and Washtenaw counties for the purpose of increasing regional mass transit spending by $4.7 billion over 20 years. Drolet organized the committee to oppose the tax increase as Treasurer of NoMassiveTransitTax.org. Proponents of the initiative spent over $3.1 million on the 'yes' vote campaign and Drolet's opposition campaign spent less than $65,000. The RTA proposal was defeated by an 895,306 yes to 913,392 no vote.\n\n## Personal life\n\nDrolet is openly gay.\n\n## References\n\nLiving people\n1967 births\nAmerican libertarians\nMichigan Constitutionalists\nCounty commissioners in Michigan\nOakland University alumni\nRepublican Party members of the Michigan House of Representatives\nLGBTQ state legislators in Michigan\nAmerican gay politicians\nLGBTQ conservatism in the United States\nTea Party movement activists\n21st-century members of the Michigan Legislature"}

It is characterized by a marked dilatation of the transverse colon, with an abrupt transition to collapsed distal colon, particularly the splenic flexure. This sign is indicative of underlying pathology, most commonly acute pancreatitis.\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe colon cut-off sign is due to local inflammation or irritation. In acute pancreatitis, the inflammatory process involving the pancreas and surrounding tissues can extend to the adjacent transverse colon through the phrenicocolic ligament. This inflammation leads to spasm and localized ileus, causing a sharp demarcation between the dilated proximal bowel and the collapsed distal segment.\n\n## Clinical Significance\n\n* Acute Pancreatitis: The most common condition associated with the colon cut-off sign. The proximity of the inflamed pancreas to the transverse colon and splenic flexure results in localized inflammation, which leads to the characteristic radiographic appearance.\n\n* Other Conditions: Though less common, other causes can include splenic infarction, colonic ischemia, or trauma, which similarly result in localized inflammatory changes and bowel spasm.\n\n## Imaging Characteristics\n\n* Abdominal Radiographs: Show a dilated transverse colon with an abrupt transition at the splenic flexure. This appearance can mimic colonic obstruction. \n\n* CT Scans: More sensitive and specific than abdominal radiograph, revealing the extent of colonic dilatation, the transition point, and often associated peripancreatic inflammation or fluid collections.\n\nThe colon cut-off sign is different from sentinel loop sign, where the dilated segment is a part of the small intestine.\n\n## References\n\nRadiologic signs"}

The church was formally created on February 2, 1927, and chartered in the U.S. state of Massachusetts in 1928 with the assistance of Metropolitan Platon Rozhdestvensky of New York; the American Orthodox Catholic Church was initially led by Archbishop Aftimios Ofiesh before his disputed suspension and deposition in 1933.\n\nThe American Orthodox Catholic Church became the first attempted autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Christian jurisdiction for North America, though it was originally intended to function as a diocese of the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America (today the Orthodox Church in America). The American Orthodox Catholic Church in its original foundation and continuation functioned as an archbishopric before elevation to the metropolitanate and then patriarchate; in modern iterations, various continuations adopt the patriarchate, most notably one led by Victor Prentice.\n\nThe purpose of the American Orthodox Catholic Church was to establish a new tradition in North America separate from any other particular ethnic or cultural traditions. It operated in the United States of America with initial support from the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America, until Ofiesh suspected autocephaly and jurisdiction over the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America, the Antiochian Archdiocese, Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, and others.\n\n## Establishment\n\nAftimios Ofiesh officially founded the American Orthodox Catholic Church in 1927 with assistance from Metropolitan Platon; it was incorporated as The Holy Eastern Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church in North America. The Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America (ROGCCA) originally supported the establishment of the North American Orthodox jurisdiction as a diocese intended to spread Eastern Orthodox Christianity throughout non-Russian American communities.\n\nAt its inception, on February 2, 1927, Metropolitan Platon pointed out that this church, \"completely autonomous and independent in its organization, constitution, administration, jurisdiction and authority, should at all times preserve its fraternal and filial attitude to the Orthodox Church of Russia, represented in Russia by the authority of the Moscow and All Russia Patriarchate, and in America by Metropolitan Platon and his canonically established and recognized successors—the Archbishops of the American jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Moscow and All Russia.\" The document was signed by Metropolitan Platon, Archbishop Ofiesh, bishops Theophilus Pashkovsky, Amphilochius Vakulsky, Arseny Chagovets and Alexius Panteleev.\n\nWithin four years, the American Orthodox Catholic Church consecrated four bishops with the charter granted from the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America. After the consecration of the four bishops, its formal members developed a constitution for the new Orthodox church.\n\n## Open hostility\n\nThe establishment of the church inspired a reactionary movement against it; at that time, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) still viewed itself as the ROGCCA's rightful canonical authority. On March 31, 1927, the Synod of Bishops of the ROCOR decided to release Metropolitan Platon from the administration of the North American diocese and prohibit him from serving within its area. The reasons for this were that Metropolitan Platon—who was appointed to put things in order in North America—further confused them.\n\nOn April 1, 1927, the Synod of Bishops of ROCOR sent a message to the faithful in North America, where Metropolitan Platon was accused of disobedience to the synod, of rebellion, and of the collapse of the affairs of the diocese. On September 8, 1927, Metropolitan Platon was finally banned from the priesthood, the divine services performed by him were recognized as ungrateful, and the ordinations were not canonical.\n\nIn accordance with the letters of Patriarch Gregory of Antioch dated April 25, 1923, Patriarch Tikhon dated January 17, 1922, as well as the resolution of the Council of Bishops of the ROCOR of 1923, Archbishop Aftimios was considered under the authority of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch. At the same time, they pointed out that Aftimios should be considered a bishop, and not an archbishop, since he received this rank illegally from Metropolitan Platon, who had no right to award hierarchs. The new holy synod, headed by Ofiesh, was recognized as non-canonical.\n\nAftimios replied forcefully, denouncing the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia for their actions and forbade his clergy and faithful from having anything to do with them. Like his estranged former associates in ROCOR, ROGCCA Metropolitan Platon turned his back on the American Orthodox Catholic Church citing lack of loyalty. However, others began to doubt Platon's support of the new church primarily because of publications in the Orthodox Catholic Review (edited by Hieromonk Boris and Priest Michael) that were aimed at the Episcopal Church USA.\n\nTo worsen matters, the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch sent Archbishop Victor (Abo-Assaley) of New York to America in 1924, where he encouraged Orthodox Arabs to come under Antiochian jurisdiction rather than under the Russians or the new American Church. Despite his efforts, he did not make much headway in his endeavors.To counteract Archbishop Victor's actions, Aftimios and his group began to focus on the establishment of the church's legal status. For a while, the American Orthodox Catholic Church enjoyed some success. In May 1928, Sophronios Beshara was consecrated as Bishop of Los Angeles. He was given responsibility for all territory west of the Mississippi River and for parishes who still considered themselves to be under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America. However, the success did not last. It was expected that with its first bishops, they would achieve a solid foundation, but this did not happen.\n\nIn 1929, Aftimios attempted to gain Greek Archbishop Alexander Demoglou's support for the new church. Demoglou was the first primate of the newly formed Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. His response was that he had authority over not only all of the Greek Orthodox in America, but also over all Orthodox Christians in America. Aftimios ordained Reverend Demetrius Cassis, an American of Greek parentage, for the new American Orthodox Catholic Church; in 1928, prior to the establishment of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and Orthodox Church of Greece rejected the American Orthodox Catholic Church as a canonical institution.\n\nIn The Quest for Orthodox Church Unity in America, Fr. Serafim believes that Aftimios's opposition to the new church had shifted from reservation to optimism. Fr. Serafim claims this shift in Aftimios's emotions because of a letter dated October 4, 1929 where Aftimios declared that:\n\n\"His Eminence, the Most Reverend Platon (Rozhdestvensky), the Metropolitan of Khersson and Odessa, has no proper, valid, legal, or effective appointment, credentials or authority to rule the North American Archdiocese of the Russian Orthodox Church in any capacity. Such being the case it follows that from the departure of His Eminence Archbishop Alexander Nemolovsky that the lawful and canonical ruling headship of the Archdiocese of the Aleutian Islands and North America in the Patriarchal Russian Church has naturally been vested in the First Vicar and Senior Bishop in this Jurisdiction\" therefore \"the title and position of 'Metropolitan of North America and Canada' has no canonical existence in the Russian Church.\" It is signed by \"Aftimios, First Vicar and Senior Bishop in the Archdiocese of the Aleutian Islands and North America.\"\n\nUndoubtedly, Aftimios wrote the letter assuming that Platon had already given him authority over all Orthodox Christians in North America. Fr. Serafim continues by saying that Aftimios's denunciation of Platon's authority barely affected the Russian parishes or their clergy. The reason for Aftimios's denunciation was that Platon would continue to rule the archdiocese until a bishop was sent to relieve him, even though the Ukaz of Patriarch Tikhon suspended Platon.\n\nDespite some troubles, Aftimios continued to explore new opportunities. He began negotiations to bring Bp. Fan Noli to serve as a bishop in the new American body, with jurisdiction over Albanian Orthodox Christians. Though Bp. Fan did eventually come to the United States, it was under the auspices of the ROGCCA. Aftimios continued his attempts to boost the legitimacy of his jurisdiction.\n\nAround October 1930, Aftimios sent a letter to his clergy indicating that they ought to keep their distance from Bp. Germanos Shehadi of Zahle who had come from Antioch, without the Antiochian Orthodox Church's authorization, to gather funds from Arabic Orthodox parishes and to encourage such parishes to come under Antioch's jurisdiction. While in the U.S., Bp. Germanos accepted Archpriest Basil Kherbawi under his omophorion. Kherbawi had previously been suspended by Abp. Aftimios for disloyalty.\n\n## Disintegration\n\nIn 1932, Aftimios's cathedral was taken from him and given over to the ROGCCA by a decision of a New York State court. The charter stated that the cathedral could only be used by a hierarch subject to the authority of the Russian Church. Nevertheless, Aftimios consecrated two more bishops, Ignatius Nichols (a former Episcopal cleric who had become an Old Catholic episcopus vagans), and Joseph Zuk of New Jersey. Zuk had ties to the Ukrainians, who had the allegiance of a half dozen parishes.\n\nAftimios's discouragement over the state of his jurisdiction is believed the cause to make the decision that is known to the Eastern Orthodox Church as the death-knell for the American Orthodox Catholic Church:\n\n\"...on the 29th of April 1933 Abp Aftimios, in defiance of all Orthodox Tradition and Canon Law... married in a civil ceremony to a young Evangelical Syrian girl born in America [she was actually a member of the Syrian Orthodox parish in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]—and despite all the efforts of responsible parties, he refused to resign as Archbishop of the new Church.\"\n\nThe two new bishops of the church, Ignatius and Joseph, voiced their support of Aftimios's marriage. In previous traditions and cultures, bishops were not allowed to marry, but since the new church is separate from any other particular ethnic or cultural traditions, they acknowledged Aftimios's decision as courageous.\n\nThree days after Aftimios's wedding, Ignatius and Joseph held a synod meeting by themselves. Since they believed that Aftimios had resigned, they elected Joseph as the new President Archbishop of the American Orthodox Catholic Church during the meeting. Ignatius was designated his successor. Serafim Surrency observes that these leadership complications eventually undermined any authority the church may have still had. Fr. Andrew Stephen Damick largely blames the multiple consecrations by Ignatius as another complication. By the summer of 1933, only six parishes remained in the American Orthodox Catholic Church.\n\nJoseph later denied making the agreement that Ignatius would be his successor. His denial was not very significant because he was already sick. Joseph died soon after, on February 23, 1934. Ignatius then got married in June 1933 and began forming ecumenical relations with the representatives of the Living Church in America. The Living Church had been competing with the ROGCCA and ROCOR. He eventually broke relations with the Living Church and returned to being an episcopus vagans. Before his death, Joseph started multiple small religious bodies, many of whom claim apostolic succession from him. He became the first bishop of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA and died as the pastor of a small community church in Middle Springs, Vermont.\n\nThe only bishop left to the American Orthodox Catholic Church was Sophronios Beshara, who then appealed to Platon for assistance. He had also intended to contact Emmanuel Abo-Hatab, but Emmanuel died on May 29, 1933. Despite his challenges, Bishop Sophronius embraced his new position as 'President Locum Tenens of the American Holy Synod.' Bishop Sophronius hoped to use his new position to mend relations with Metr. Platon and to be viewed as an equal authority within the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nBy this point, Platon was focused on the arrival of the representative of the Patriarchate from Russia, Bishop Benjamin Fedchenkov. Fedchenkov's purpose in the United States was to investigate the ecclesiastical status of Orthodox America. Due to the new church's lack of support, the remaining priests and parishes joined other authorities or became members of the independent sacramental movement; many churches in the ISM self-identified as the American Orthodox Catholic Church. Hieromonk Boris and Priest Michael were received back into the authority of Moscow and the ROGCCA.\n\nLater in 1933, the formal \"Removal from Office and Suspencion\" of Aftimios was officially done on 7 October 1933 in his capacity as president locum tenens. Later Sophronius then wrote a deposition letter on Ignatius Nicholas on 2 November 1933. Sophronius still refused to submit to Platon or Benjamin from the Moscow Patriarchate. The American Orthodox Catholic Church in its original form remained dormant when Sophronius died in 1934 in Los Angeles. Serafim Surrency gives the date of his death as 1934, but his gravestone reads 1940. He is now buried at the Antiochian Village in Pennsylvania alongside St. Raphael of Brooklyn and Emmanuel Abo-Hatab.\n\n## Succession claims\n\nA continuation of the church is the jurisdiction trademarked as \"The Holy Eastern Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church in North America, Inc.\" This continuation claimed to have been \"held in locum tenens due to lack of clergy\" and Ofiesh's widow served on the corporate board until 1999. The incorporated and trademarked church was recognized by the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for its continued existence in 2009. This continuation claimed 9 clergy, 17 churches, and 4,138 members in 2001.\n\n## Further reading\n\n* Damick, Rev. Andrew Stephen.

It is located within the mainland frazione of Mestre, and is classified by its owner, Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, as a gold category station.\n\nThe station is situated at the mark of the Milan–Venice line, and at the mark of the Adria–Mestre line. It is also the point of origin of other lines that converge towards Venice as the capital of the region Veneto.\n\nAdditionally, the station forms the border between the boroughs of Mestre and Marghera, that are connected by the two underpasses of the station, one just for pedestrians and the other for both pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nVenezia Mestre is one of Venice's two most important railway stations, the other one being Venezia Santa Lucia, a terminal station on the island of Venice. Both stations are managed by Grandi Stazioni, and they are linked with each other by the Ponte della Libertà () between the mainland and the island.\n\nWhile Venezia Santa Lucia station's main doors are usually closed at night, Venezia Mestre station is always open and people can pass by also at night, to get on one of the few night trains or to use the underpasses between Mestre and Marghera (shops and ticket offices are usually closed at night).\n\nLate night or early morning trains might stop at Venezia Mestre station if the Venezia Santa Lucia station is closed at such time.\nIn that case, passengers directed to/coming from the Historical Center of Venice they should use the 24/7 ACTV bus service (lines 2 and H1) from Piazzale Roma to Venezia Mestre station and vice versa.\n\n## Train services\n\nThe following services call at the station:\n\n* High speed services (Frecciarossa) Salerno – Naples – Rome – Florence – Bologna – Padua – Venice\n\n* High speed services (Italo) Salerno – Naples – Rome – Florence – Bologna – Padua – Venice\n\n* High speed services (Frecciarossa) Naples – Rome – Florence – Bologna – Padua – Venice\n\n* High speed services (Frecciarossa) Rome Airport – Rome – Florence – Bologna – Padua – Venice\n\n* High speed services (Frecciarossa) Turin – Milan – Verona – Padua – Venice – Trieste\n\n* High speed services (Frecciarossa) Turin – Milan – Verona – Padua – Venice\n\n* High speed services (Frecciarossa) Milan – Verona – Padua – Venice – Treviso – Udine\n\n* High speed services (Frecciargento) Reggio Calabria – Lamezia Terme – Paola – Salerno – Naples – Rome – Florence – Bologna – Ferrara – Padua – Venice\n\n* High speed services (Frecciabianca) Lecce – Bari – Ancona – Rimini – Padua – Venice\n\n* Intercity services (EuroCity) Munich – Innsbruck – Verona – Padua – Venice\n\n* Intercity services (EuroCity) Zurich – Arth-Goldau – Bellinzona – Milan – Verona – Padua – Venice\n\n* Intercity services (EuroCity) Geneva – Lausanne – Brig – Milan – Verona – Padua – Venice\n\n* High speed services (Railjet) Vienna – Klagenfurt – Villach – Udine – Treviso – Venice\n\n* Intercity services (Intercity) Rome – Florence – Bologna – Padua – Venice – Trieste\n\n* Night train (Nightjet) Munich – Tarvisio – Udine – Treviso – Venice\n\n* Night train (Nightjet) Rome – Bologna – Venice – Villach – Vienna\n\n* Night train (Nightjet) Vienna – Linz – Salzburg – Villach – Udine – Treviso – Venice\n\n* Night train (Intercity Notte) Rome – Bologna – Venice – Udine – Trieste\n\n* Express services (Regionale Veloce) Bologna – Ferrara – Rovigo – Padua – Venice\n\n* Express services (Regionale Veloce) Verona – Vicenza – Padua – Venice\n\n* Express services (Regionale Veloce) Verona – Padua – Venice – Latisana\n\n* Express services (Regionale Veloce) Trieste – Cervignano del Friuli – Portogruaro – Venice\n\n* Express services (Regionale Veloce) Trieste – Gorizia – Udine – Treviso – Venice\n\n* Regional services (Treno regionale) Ferrara – Rovigo – Monselice – Padua – Venice\n\n* Regional services (Treno regionale) Verona – Vicenza – Padua – Venice\n\n* Regional services (Treno regionale) Trieste – Gorizia – Udine – Treviso – Venice\n\n* Regional services (Treno regionale) Bassano del Grappa – Castelfranco Veneto – Venice\n\n* Local services (Treno regionale) Portogruaro – Venice\n\n* Local services (Treno regionale) Adria – Piove di Sacco – Venice\n\n## Traffic\n\nVenezia Mestre is a crucial part of the railway system of the north east of Italy. An important port for both freight and passengers, it has approximately 500 trains and 85,000 passengers each day. It is also a strategic hub, at which the Milan–Venice, Venice–Udine, Trento–Venice, Venice–Trieste and Adria–Mestre lines converge, and from which a four track main line leads to Venezia Santa Lucia.\n\n## Future developments\n\nVenezia Mestre will be one of the railway stations on the so-called Pan-European Corridor 5. It will also be part of the Veneto region's Metropolitan Regional Rail System (SFMR) network, which will involve all of its lines. For better management of the Venezia Mestre railway junction, numerous works are therefore currently underway.\n\nFirst, the number of platforms at the station is being increased from nine to thirteen, together with crossing loops.\n\nSecondly, and most importantly, work is being done to achieve the partial reactivation of Linea dei Bivi, which has been closed since 1993. The reactivated line will begin at Marocco junction, on the Venice-Udine line, and end almost at the former Mirano junction. It will include the former Orgnano double junction, and Spinea junction, on the Trento–Venice line.\n\nInstead of merging with the Milan-Venice line in the direction of Lombardy's capital, the reborn Bivi line passes over a curved bridge, the Maerne viaduct, which crosses more than four tracks of the Milan line. The reopened Bivi line then joins the Milan-Venice line at the Venice Mestre station throat. This arrangement separates the Trento and Milan lines from each other, and also create an alternative route for trains to Udine.\n\nThe new line from the former Orgnano double junction over the Maerne viaduct to Venezia Mestre was officially opened on 30 May 2008 and entered service on 10 June 2008. From 7 June 2008, there was consequential abandonment of the Gruppo Scambi (ex Quadrivio Catene) high speed line between the former Orgnano double junction and just before Venezia Mestre, including the former Venezia Asseggiano railway station. The closed portion of line will be reused as a disused railway bicycle path.\n\nThese changes will assign to each incoming line a dedicated track, without any intersections between the lines. In particular, tracks 1 and 2 are assigned to the line from Trieste, tracks 3 and 4 to the Udine line, 5 and 6 to the Padua high speed line, 9, 10 and 11 to the original Padua line, and 12 and 13 to the lines for Adria and Trento. Finally, tracks 7 and 8 will be dedicated to those trains leaving or arriving at Venezia Mestre that do not also leave or arrive from Venezia Santa Lucia.\n\nThe Venezia Mestre station building is also being modified with a view to better organization of spaces, and to suit commercial services closely linked to the railway, such as the ticket office. It will also become fully accessible to disabled people, through the construction of lifts to each platform.\n\nIn the first half of 2009, all the old paddle type destination boards at the station were replaced with new boards fitted with LED displays.\n\n## Public transport connections\n\nThe station is served by several ATVO suburban bus routes, and 15 urban and 1 suburban bus routes operated by ACTV, 13 of them in transit.\n\n## Urban/suburban buses\n\n* 2 VENEZIA – DELLA LIBERTÀ – VEMPA – MESTRE FS – PIAVE – CIRCONVALLAZIONE – TORRE BELFREDO – V.LE GARIBALDI – S.DONÀ – PASQUALIGO – V.LE DON STURZO\n\n* 3 SFMR OSPEDALE – DON PERON – TERRAGLIO – TREZZO – V.LE GARIBALDI – TORRE BELFREDO – CIRCONVALLAZIONE – CARDUCCI – CAPPUCCINA – VEMPA – DURANDO – P.ZZALE GIOVANNACCI – LAVELLI – P.ZZA S.ANTONIO – PALEOCAPA – TRIESTE – CATENE – VILLABONA\n\n* 10 ASSEGGIANO – IST.MORIN – GAZZERA ALTA – QUARNARO – MATTUGLIE – CALABRIA – MIRANESE – CARDUCCI – CAPPUCCINA – MESTRE FS – TRENTO – MIRANESE – CALABRIA – MATTUGLIE – CALUCCI – GAZZERA ALTA – ASSEGGIANO\n\n* 15 AEROPORTO M.POLO – TESSERA – ORLANDA – FORTE MARGHERA – P.ZZA 27 OTTOBRE – CORSO DEL POPOLO – VEMPA – MESTRE FS\n\n* 18 MESTRE FS – VEMPA – F.LLI BANDIERA – MALCONTENTA – DELLA STAZIONE – PADANA – COLOMBARA – CA' SABBIONI\n\n* 31 PERTINI (IST.FOSCARI) – BISSUOLA – COLOMBO – OLIVI – CARDUCCI – PIAVE – MESTRE FS\n\n* 31H OSPEDALE – DON TOSATTO – DON PERON – TERRAGLIO – CIRCONVALLAZIONE – PIAVE – MESTRE FS – CA' MARCELLO – TORINO (UNIVERSITÀ) – V.LE ANCONA – FORTE MARGHERA – MESTRE CENTRO – V.LE S.MARCO – VIA SANSOVINO – V.LE VESPUCCI – RIONE PERTINI – PERTINI – BISSUOLA – MESTRE CENTRO – S.ROCCO – EINAUDI – TORRE BELFREDO – CIPRESSINA – OSPEDALE\n\n* 32 MESTRE FS – PIAVE – CIRCONVALLAZIONE – EINAUDI – GIULIANI – TORRE BELFREDO – V.LE GARIBALDI – SPALTI – BISSUOLA – PERTINI – CAMPORESE (IST.GRITTI)\n\n* 32H OSPEDALE – CIPRESSINA – EINAUDI – S.ROCCO – MESTRE CENTRO – BISSUOLA – PERTINI – RIONE PERTINI – V.LE VESPUCCI – VIA SANSOVINO – V.LE S.MARCO – MESTRE CENTRO – 27 OTTOBRE – FORTE MARGHERA – V.LE ANCONA – VIA TORINO – CA' MARCELLO – MESTRE FS – PIAVE – CIRCONVALLAZIONE – TERRAGLIO – DON PERON – DONTOSATTO – OSPEDALE\n\n* 33H OSPEDALE – CASTELLANA – VIA PIAVE – MESTRE FS – CORSO DEL POPOLO – VIA BISSUOLA – CAVERGNAGO\n\n* 34H OSPEDALE – TERRAGLIO -VIA PIAVE – MESTRE FS – CORSO DEL POPOLO – BISSUOLA – PERTINI\n\n* 43 VENEZIA – DELLA LIBERTÀ – SAN GIULIANO – FORTE MARGHERA – V.LE ANCONA – TORINO (UNIVERSITÀ) – CÀ MARCELLO – MESTRE FS\n\n* 53 PIAZZA 27 OTTOBRE – VIA PIAVE – MESTRE FS – MONTEFIBRE – MALCONTENTA\n\n* 86 MESTRE FS – VEMPA – BANCHINA DELL'AZOTO\n\n* N1 VENEZIA – V.LE S.

Sherman, Eduard Vilde, Heinrich Mann, Jaan Kross, Lilian Põldre, and Françoise Sagan.\n\nPoom also appeared on several ETV children's television series, including Vandersellid with Guido Kangur and Ivo Eensalu from 1982 until 1983, as the character Dwarf Paul in the 1981 Ene-Mari Tali-penned series Päkapikula, and as Taat in the Ene-Mari Tali-penned Paharet lumeveskis in 1986. On several of the series, he also wrote the accompanying music.\n\n## Radio\n\nBetween 1980 and 1992, Poom worked extensively as an actor in radio plays for Eesti Raadio, including productions of works by such authors and playwrights as: Gianni Rodari, Yanka Kupala, Eduard Vilde, Selma Lagerlöf, Boris Vasilyev, Barrie Stavis, Nodar Dumbadze, Alexander Pushkin, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Ardi Liives, and Paul-Eerik Rummo.\n\n## Assault and disability\n\nAt 9:00 am in late February 1993, police in Tallinn Old Town found an unconscious, bleeding man lying on Vene Street with his pockets turned inside out. Police initially incorrectly assumed the man was a vagrant and intoxicated and they transported him to a sobering up facility in the city's subdistrict of Männiku. After he didn't regain consciousness, authorities realized that he wasn't intoxicated and was having a medical emergency and he was transported to Mustamäe Emergency Hospital, where emergency physicians determined that the man had suffered a severe beating. Poom was unrecognizable due to the assault and could only relay that his given name was Paul. He was admitted to the hospital under the name \"Paul Unknown\" before lapsing into a coma and was placed on a ventilator.\n\nPoom was eventually identified and spent nearly a year in hospital and required two brain surgeries. He eventually regained consciousness, but was left permanently disabled; losing most of his sight, the ability to speak, and with severely impaired motor and cognitive function. With donations from the Estonian Theatre Union, he was transferred to the Tartu University Clinic, where he was able to regain some mobility and eventually learned to speak again. However, he is left in need of continuous care.\n\nPoom has only a vague recollection of the assault, believing he was attacked by two men and two women. No one was ever charged in connection with the assault.\n\n## Personal life\n\nPoom was married to Mare Poom and later divorced. The couple have a daughter. He was later in a long-term relationship with actress Anne Paluver, with whom he has a son. Poom is a grandfather.\n\nPoom currently resides in Tallinn. He formerly lived with his elderly mother Ilse and his stepfather Henno who acted as his primary caretakers. He is occasionally visited by former theatre and television colleagues including former Tallinn State Conservatory classmates Ain Lutsepp, Anne Veesaar, and until 2018 Roman Baskin, as well as actor and musician Tõnis Mägi.\n\n## External links\n\n* \n\n1958 births\nLiving people\nEstonian male stage actors\nEstonian male film actors\nEstonian male television actors\nEstonian male voice actors\nMale actors from Tallinn\nEstonian Academy of Music and Theatre alumni\nEstonian victims of crime\n20th-century Estonian male actors"}

{"id": "57038429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience%20in%20art", "title": "Resilience in art", "text": "In art, resilience is the capacity of the work of art to preserve through aesthetics its particularity distinguishing it from any other object, despite the increasing subjectivization in the production of works. Resilience in art appears as a response to the gradual setting aside of beauty during the twentieth century resulting today in an inability to define the work of art.\n\n## History\n\nThe late nineteenth and twentieth century saw the birth of art movements such as Symbolism, Cubism and Surrealism which sought to adjust to the great social, industrial, economic and political changes that were taking place at the time. Parallel to these movements is a series of strangest movements such as Hirsutes, Hydropathes, Incohérents and highly politicized and subversive movements such as Constructivism, Suprematism, Futurism and Dada. These movements, combined with Anglo-Saxon Analytic Aesthetics from the 1950s which is characterized by the rejection of the notion of beauty as the foundation of art, call into question the very existence of the work of art as a specific human achievement.\n\nThe Analytic Aesthetics will base art on the consensus of the \"world of art\", thus accepting that any object whatsoever may be considered as art as long as it is shown in a place provided for this purpose. Thus art no longer offers homogeneity linked to a cultural substratum but a plurality of individualities. It does not unfold in time, its duration often becomes ephemeral. Beauty is considered superfluous, asserting that a work of art does not have to be based on beauty, for it is self-sufficient.\n\nAnalytic Aesthetics is rooted in the philosophy of the eighteenth century when philosophers, like Edmund Burke or Herbart claim that there is no existing beauty by itself. Beauty is not in the object itself but in the subject who experiences some emotion. Little by little, the idea of beauty gives way to the feeling of beauty. The objective definition of the beautiful becomes impossible, it is relegated to the subjective evaluation of the viewer. Thus the theory of beauty that has been a knowledge based on mathematics since the Greeks becomes a subjective aesthetic feeling. Added to this, theories on autonomy of ugliness will encourage the proliferation of the most random, unsightly and provocative productions in the context of contemporary art. What one can argue with the analytic aesthetic is that in his analyzes he does not start from art as a conceptual unit but relies on the artist's achievements at a certain historical moment. Analytical philosophers choose Marcel Duchamp's urinal and Andy Warhol's work as a foundation for their position and as a new starting point. The same can be said about postmodern thinking and the \"unrepresentable\" in Jean-François Lyotard, which is also linked to European histories.\n\nOther factors have had a significant impact on the confusing situation in art today. Throughout the twentieth century different fields of knowledge have focused on art: Philosophy, Sociology, Psychoanalysis, History of Art, Economy, which led to a dismemberment of the very notion of art. Each branch has emphasized some of the peculiarities of this very complex \"world\" that is art. Everyone has made contributions on this or that facet by losing sight of the totality. The domains have separated, each with its own criteria. As a result, follows an erroneous conclusion about the impossibility of the definition of art and the complete absence of the capacity of judgment of the quality of the works, therefore of the recognition of a production as being art. What Lyotard will call the bursting of the \"grand narratives\" of modernity, which envisioned humanity engaged on the path of emancipation, has contributed to the advent of the autonomous subject which becomes the finality in itself. Postmodern thinking will value differences and particularisms based solely on individual will. From there, at the level of the arts, it is only the intention of the artist that counts. With increasing subjectivization, the figure of the artist and his sensitivity will prevail over any rational approach.\n\n## Resilience in art\n\nResilience in art tends to restore the foundations of art on the beauty and restore art to unity. \n\n* In the division of the perception between objective and subjective resilience opposes a joint operation. The beauty in the work is perceived objectively, it is the first fraction of the second where the spectator is in front of the work, then intervenes the subjective judgment in relation to the experience of this one. We now benefit from new knowledge in neurobiology which studies by medical imaging the behavior of the brain in relation to the beauty and where actually we can record these two times in which intervenes in turn the neocortex and the archaic brain. Moreover, every individual instantly recognizes the beautiful as such, which encourages the idea of the beauty based on the structures of the world (see Pythagoras, Influence on art and architecture). Follows the judgment \"I like, I do not like\" . The indistinction of these two times certainly favored the idea of beauty as a subjective taste. This double factor is in action also during the creation by the artist. On the one hand, it takes into account his experience, his way of seeing the world, his knowledge and intuitions, but also his capacity to capture and restore the world around him. To this is added the quality of elaboration and structuring of the work with the same harmony found in nature. \n\n* Where contemporary art relies solely on the intention of the artist, resilience sets the artist's responsibility to the community, because art is a receiver of the \"image\" of the community and acts in parallel on the cohesion of it. Man is a social being, by nature he must live in society to exist, excessive individualism is impossible, these two facets must be harmoniously combined.\n\n* Theoretically, instead of a split approach, resilience is a systemic approach. At the level of practice, resilience removes the discourse that clutters art productions and focuses on the development of the work. \n\n* Considering that the quality of a work of art is objectively identifiable, resilience in art rules out random, purely gestural, unsightly, conceptual or only decorative productions. A work of art consists of aesthetic regime and ethical regime. We can rationally judge the aesthetic quality of the work and we can apprehend it by our sensitivity in its \"legible\" part, in what it \"speaks\" or what it evokes.\n\n* Resilience relegates the ephemeral art to the game or the show and opts for the work that projects itself in the long term. One of the reasons is its formative nature.\n\n* At the formal level, resilience requires the diversity of expressions in place of contemporary art production, which for decades has finally generated instantly recognizable images as \"contemporary art\" and finished in a new academicism rejecting any other form of art as obsolete.\nAll cultures generate images of themselves through art images, but not all art images are works of art. Contemporary art imposing itself as current art is perhaps the image of ours, but resilience is essential when it comes to its quality as art.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n \n\n* Alfred Gell, Art and Agency, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1998 \n\n* Clement Greenberg, La peinture moderniste, in : Charles Harrisson and Paul Wood éd, Art en Théorie, 1900-1990, Hazan, Paris, 1997.\n\n* Edgar Morin, La Nature de la nature (t. 1), Le Seuil, Nouvelle édition, coll.

{"id": "6959510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County%20Route%20510%20%28New%20Jersey%29", "title": "County Route 510 (New Jersey)", "text": "County Route 510 (CR 510) is a county highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The highway extends from North Road (CR 513) in Chester to McCarter Highway (Route 21) in Newark.\n\nA separate, westbound portion of CR 510 stretches through Morristown.\n\n## Morris County\n\nCR 510 begins at an intersection with CR 513 in Chester Borough, Morris County, heading southeast on two-lane undivided Main Street. From the western terminus, CR 510 is signed as part of the former Route 24, which continues west along CR 513. The road passes through residential areas as it crosses into Chester Township and becomes Mendham Road, continuing southeast through more wooded areas of homes along with a few fields. The route curves east and continues into Mendham Township. Farther east, CR 510 continues into Mendham Borough and becomes Main Street, running through residential neighborhoods. In the commercial center of town, the route intersects CR 525 and CR 614. From this point, the road turns northeast and passes more homes as well as a few businesses, intersecting CR 646 before crossing back into Mendham Township. CR 510 runs east again near more residences before entering Morris Township and becomes Mendham Road again. Here, the road runs through forested areas near Lewis Morris Park before running through more woodland with a few homes. The route begins to turn more to the northeast as it enters more residential surroundings before crossing into Morristown. At this point, CR 510 heads east on Washington Street and passes homes and businesses. The road reaches the commercial downtown and intersects CR 648 before meeting US 202 and the western terminus of Route 124 at the Park Place square.\n\nAfter running through the square, CR 510 leaves the former alignment of Route 24 and continues east onto Morris Street, passing more downtown businesses. Along this stretch, CR 510 splits into a one-way pair, with the eastbound direction continuing east on Morris Street, which is a two-way road, and the westbound direction following Lafayette Street, which is one-way westbound carrying three lanes. Both directions cross under New Jersey Transit's Morristown Line near the Morristown Station. The eastbound alignment of the route becomes three lanes with two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane after the railroad bridge, passing through commercial areas before running near a few homes, while the westbound direction passes businesses. Both directions of the route come to an interchange with I-287. From this interchange, eastbound CR 510 runs through residential areas as a one-way road with three lanes while westbound CR 510 passes through woodland. The two directions of CR 510 join again at an intersection with CR 511 on the border of Morristown and Morris Township. westbound CR 510 runs northeast along two-way, four-lane divided Whippany Road and southeast and intersects CR 511 as it turns southeast onto Columbia Turnpike. After the one-way pair, CR 510 heads east on four-lane undivided Columbia Turnpike past business parks and residential neighborhoods in Morris Township, eventually gaining a third eastbound lane. The route becomes a four-lane divided highway as it crosses CR 623 and enters Hanover Township as it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with the Route 24 freeway. Following this, the road continues into Florham Park as a four-lane undivided road as it passes to the south of Morristown Municipal Airport and runs through woods and meadows. The road passes homes before intersecting CR 608/CR 632 and CR 609 in a commercial area, at which point CR 510 is briefly a divided highway. The route curves southeast and passes near more residential neighborhoods prior to widening back into a divided highway and passing to the south of business parks.\n\n## Essex County\n\nUpon crossing the Passaic River, CR 510 enters Livingston in Essex County and becomes four-lane undivided South Orange Avenue as it runs through wooded areas with some business parks. After an intersection with the southern terminus of the Eisenhower Parkway (CR 609), the route becomes a divided highway again and passes between the Livingston Mall to the north and a branch of Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center to the south. After crossing CR 607, the road becomes undivided again and passes to the south of residential neighborhoods before running through dense forests. In this area, CR 510 crosses CR 649, where it is briefly a grade-separated divided highway, before becoming undivided and crossing CR 608. From here, the route enters residential areas and crosses into Millburn, coming to the junction with CR 527. A short distance past CR 527, the road heads east into the forested South Mountain Reservation, a part of the Watchung Mountains. In this area, the road becomes a divided highway again and crosses the West Branch of the Rahway River into Maplewood. The route passes under a bridal path and winds southeast through the reservation (known locally as the \"S Curves\"), becoming the border between South Orange to the north and Maplewood to the south as it leaves the South Mountain Reservation and enters residential areas. A $30 million project to rework the \"S curves\" for safety and drainage is in progress.\n\nCR 510 becomes undivided again as it fully enters South Orange and continues east through wooded areas of homes, forming a brief concurrency with CR 577. The road heads into the commercial downtown of South Orange as it passes over the East Branch of the Rahway River and under New Jersey Transit's Morris & Essex Lines near the South Orange Station. The route intersects CR 638 Spur, CR 638, and CR 665 before passing near more homes and running to the north of Seton Hall University. CR 510 enters Newark at the Longfellow Avenue/Dover Street intersection and continues east into more commercial areas. The road crosses CR 605 and becomes the border between East Orange to the north and Newark to the south as it comes to the CR 619 junction. CR 510 fully enters Newark again as it comes to an interchange with the Garden State Parkway before passing to the south of Holy Sepulchre Cemetery and forming a brief concurrency with CR 509 a short distance later. The road passes south of Fairmount Cemetery and passes several urban homes and businesses, narrowing to two lanes before passing the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, where the route is five lanes wide with two eastbound lanes and three westbound lanes. CR 510 narrows to two lanes again as it intersects CR 603, where the route turns northeast onto Springfield Avenue. At this point, the route enters Downtown Newark and turns east onto four-lane Market Street near the Essex County Veterans Courthouse. At the Broad Street intersection, the road passes through Four Corners, which serves as the center of Newark. CR 510 comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with Route 21 near Newark Penn Station, with Market Street continuing east under Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to provide access to Raymond Boulevard.\n\n## History\n\nThe section running from Chester to Morristown was originally created as part of the Washington Turnpike, which stretched from Morristown to Philipsburg. This road was later incorporated into the William Penn Highway, which ran from New York to Pittsburgh. This was incorporated into Route 24 in 1927, before being removed by 1992. The section running from Morristown to Newark was created as the Columbia Turnpike. County Route 513 was established largely along its present-day alignment in 1952, along with the other 500-series county highways. The original eastern terminus was likely at Springfield Avenue in Newark, which was at the time Route 24. When that highway was truncated to the Maplewood/Irvington line, the segment of Route 24 east of South Orange Avenue was made part of CR 510; the route extended east of Route 21 along Market Street and Raymond Boulevard to an eastern terminus at the intersection of U.S. Route 1/9 and U.S. Route 1/9 Truck on the very eastern edge of Newark. This routing definitely existed in 1973, though the exact start and end dates are uncertain.\n\n## External links\n\n* NJDOT County Route 510 Westbound through Morristown Straight Line Diagram from the New Jersey Department of Transportation \n\n* An enlarged view of road jurisdiction of US 202, NJ 124 and CR 510 in Morristown\n\n* NJ State Highways: CR 200-514\n\n* CR 510 Photos\n\n510\n510\n510\nTransportation in Newark, New Jersey"}

Unlike many musicians, he felt at home in the recording studio and actually preferred working without an audience. His recording career ran from November 1920, when working with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes he recorded the ballet music, The Good-Humoured Ladies, to December 1978, when he made his final recording of music by Hubert Parry.\n\nA discography of Boult recordings was compiled by Mike Ashman and published in Records and Recording, July 1974. A further discography by Nigel Simeone was published in Sir Adrian Boult: Companion of Honour, 1980, Midas Books.
